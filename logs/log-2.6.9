    [PATCH] security issue in firmware system
    
    The firmware loader has a security issue.  Firmware on some devices can
    write to all memory through DMA.  Therefore the ability to feed firmware
    to the kernel is equivalent to writing to /dev/kmem.  CAP_SYS_RAWIO is
    needed to protect itself.
    
    [ Editors note: the firmware file is 0644, and owned by root, so this
      "security issue" is really only an issue for people who use
      capabilities explicitly, rather than the regular Unix permissions.
      This patch makes it do the same checks we do for /dev/mem etc.  ]

    [PATCH] kswapd lockup fix
    
    Fix some bugs in the kswapd logic which can cause kswapd lockups.
    
    The balance_pgdat() logic is supposed to cause kswapd to loop across all zones
    in the node until each zone either
    
    	a) has enough pages free or
    
    	b) is deemed to be in an "all pages unreclaimable" state.
    
    In the latter case, we just give the zone a light scan on each balance_pgdat()
    scan and wait for the zone to come back to life again.
    
    But the zone->all_unreclaimable logic is broken - if the zone has no pages on
    the LRU at all, we perform no scanning of that zone (of course).  So the
    zone->pages_scanned is not incremented and the expression
    
    		if (zone->pages_scanned > zone->present_pages * 2)
    			zone->all_unreclaimable = 1;
    
    never is satisfied.
    
    The patch changes that logic to
    
    		if (zone->pages_scanned >= (zone->nr_active +
    						zone->nr_inactive) * 4)
    			zone->all_unreclaimable = 1;
    
    so if the zone has no LRU pages it will still enter the all_unreclaimable
    state.
    
    
    Another problem is that if the zone has no LRU pages we will tell
    shrink_slab() that we scanned zero LRU pages.  This causes shrink_slab() to
    scan zero slab objects, which is obviously wrong.  So change shrink_slab() to
    perform a decent chunk of slab scanning in this situation.
    
    
    And put a cond_resched() into the balance_pgdat() outer loop.  Probably
    unnecessary, but that's what Jeff had in place when he confirmed that this
    patch fixed the lockup :(

    [PATCH] uml: fix critical IP checksum corruption
    
    From: Lars Ellenberg <Lars.Ellenberg@linbit.com>
    
    Add a memory barrier to the assembly checksum code - the code was copied
    straight from the i386 one, and the patch resyncs the code with the
    original.  I'll check if the original code can be included directly (i.e.
    "#include") after 2.6.9.
    
    Without this patch, every 2.6 UML release corrupts the checksum of every
    UDP fragmented packet with size >= MTU (verified by various people, we all
    agree on this issue; nobody reported "Works fine here").  The corrupted
    packets are not accepted, thus blocking any kind of communication with
    large-sized UDP packets.
    
    In fact, I've even dissected the UML -> host traffic before and after this
    patch with Ethereal - and it always reported an incorrect checksum for
    fragmented UDP packets before and always correct after applying the patch.

    [PATCH] uml: use always a separate io thread for UBD
    
    Currently, ubd=sync is different from replacing ubd#= with ubd#s=.  This is
    against Principle of Least Surprise, so remove this difference.
    
    Also the current ubd=sync behaviour is completely useless: it is to make sure
    that when the kernel has synched its I/O to the virtual disk, the host does
    not invalidate this with his caching; this causes ReiserFS corruption.
    
    But since actually we call end_request() only after the io_thread has done its
    work, we never lie to the block layer.  Using O_SYNC as we do when replacing
    ubd#= with ubd#s= is enough.

    In detail:
    
    Rename ubd_finish() to __ubd_finish() and remove ubd_io_lock from it.  Add
    wrapper, ubd_finish(), which grabs lock before calling __ubd_finish().  Update
    do_ubd_request to use the lock free __ubd_finish() to avoid deadlock.  Also,
    apparently prepare_request is called with ubd_io_lock held, so remove locks
    there.

    [PATCH] uml: no extraversion in arch/um/Makefile for mainline
    
    Extraversion in arch/um/Makefile is not needed in mainline, but just for
    separate patches; also, they should set it in the main Makefile, not elsewhere
    (Jeff Garzik has just complained).  Also remove the dependency from version.h
    on arch/um/Makefile: it was added because arch/um/Makefile could change the
    kernel version number.

    [PATCH] uml: force using /bin/bash for building
    
    This forces make to use bash rather than whatever /bin/sh is linked to.
    Without this, since there are some bash extensions used in the build and when
    /bin/sh isn't bash, then the build fails without a clear error message.

    [PATCH] uml: Set cflags before including arch Makefile
    
    If arch/$(ARCH)/Makefile is included before adding -O2 (and the rest) to
    CFLAGS, I must duplicate the addition of it to USER_CFLAGS for UML.  So let's
    fix this.  Also, the below code is useless, since if CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO is y,
    then CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER is always y.
    
    ifeq ($(CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO),y)
    CFLAGS := $(subst -fomit-frame-pointer,,$(CFLAGS))

    [PATCH] SELinux: fix bugs in mprotect hook
    
    The patch below by Roland McGrath fixes two bugs in the implementation of
    the selinux_file_mprotect hook:
    
      It calls selinux_file_mmap, which has two problems.  First, the stacked
      security module will get both mmap and mprotect callbacks for an
      mprotect call, which is wrong.  Secondly, the vm_flags value contains
      VM_* bits, and these do not match the MAP_* bits of the same name or
      function, so it passes bogus flags and causes every mprotect to be
      treated as if MAP_SHARED were in use.
    
      The patch shares the common code while not having one function call the
      other, and fixes these two bugs.

    [PATCH] Fix reporting of process start times
    
    Derive process start times from the posix_clock_monotonic notion of uptime
    instead of "jiffies", consistent with the earlier change to /proc/uptime
    itself.
    (http://linus.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/cset@3ef4851dGg0fxX58R9Zv8SIq9fzNmQ?na%0Av=index.html|src/.|src/fs|src/fs/proc|related/fs/proc/proc_misc.c)
    
    Process start times are reported to userspace in units of 1/USER_HZ since
    boot, thus applications as procps need the value of "uptime" to convert
    them into absolute time.
    
    Currently "uptime" is derived from an ntp-corrected time base, but process
    start time is derived from the free-running "jiffies" counter.  This
    results in inaccurate, drifting process start times as seen by the user,
    even if the exported number stays constant, because the users notion of
    "jiffies" changes in time.
    
    It's John Stultz's patch anyways, which I only messed up a bit, but since
    people started trading signed-off lines on lkml:

    [PATCH] m32r: remove obsolete system calls
    
    This patch is for removing obsolete system calls from m32r kernel, such as
    old_mmap and old_select.
    
    	* arch/m32r/kernel/entry.S:
    	- Remove an obsolete system call, old_mmap, from the syscall table.
    
    	* arch/m32r/kernel/sys_m32r.c:
    	- Remove obsolete system calls, old_mmap() and old_select().
    	- do_mmap2() is renamed to sys_mmap2().
    
    * CAUTION (for m32r users):
      The new kernel (applied this patch) does not have a backward
      compatibility. The new kernel and old library pair does not work.
    
      So, those who want to use the new kernel must use a new version of
      glibc (the GNU C library), which uses the "mmap2(_NR_mmap2)" syscall
      for __mmap() instead of the "old_mmap(__NR_mmap)".
    
      The new glibc package, libc6_2.3.2.ds1-16.0.3_m32r.deb, is provided
      on the following site, please apt-get/download it and upgrade.

    [PATCH] USB: Fix hiddev devfs oops
    
    From: Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>
    
    There is a long-standing devfs_unregister oops in hid/hiddev.  It's caused
    by hid calling hiddev_exit before unregistering itself which in turn calls
    hiddev_disconnect.
    
    hiddev_exit removes the directory which contains the hiddev devices.
    Therefore it needs to be called after the hiddev devices have been
    disconnected.

    [PATCH] USB: Fix oops in usblp driver
    
    This bug was reported back in July, and I sent out a patch but apparently
    it never got to you.  The usblp driver was calling usb_buffer_free() from
    usblp_cleanup(), which runs after disconnect() if a user process holds the
    device open.  But once the usb_device is gone usb_buffer_free() will
    oops.  The patch frees the buffers in usb_disconnect() instead.
    
    Recently Joost Witteveen reported the same oops and found that the
    patch solved it for him.  So there shouldn't be problems with accepting

    [PATCH] USB: EHCI SMP fix
    
    This addresses an SMP-only issue with the EHCI driver, where only one CPU
    should scan the schedule at a time (scanning is not re-entrant) but either
    the IRQ handler or a watchdog timer could end up starting it.  Many thanks
    to Olaf Hering for isolating the failure mode, and testing this fix!
    
    Once once CPU starts scanning, any other might as well finish right
    away.  This fix just adds a flag to detect that case.

    [PATCH] USB: "Lost sync on frames" error in konicawc module
    
    From: <fgalea@prism.uvsq.fr>
    
    http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3286
    
    The kernel keeps printing "Lost sync on frames" error messages as soon as a
    program tries to access the webcam.  No video data can be retrieved from
    the webcam.
    
    The following patch seems enough to solve the problem.  (just inverting the
    order at which the old and new data blocks are sent to the user).

    [PATCH] ACPI: check parameter for NULL
    
    ACPI still explodes on my old PII and stops it booting.
    
    Anyway, it is oopsing in drivers/acpi/scan.c line 207 where element
    (which is NULL) gets dereferenced.
    
    The ACPI bios on this thing has always seemed to be pretty broken, but
    this at least allows the 'power' button to continue to work (the only
    reason why I want ACPI).

    Use "request_resource()" to properly fix up PCI resource clashes.
    
    This is made possible by the previous resource allocation ordering
    patch.
    
    Now that we run the pre-existing PCI resource discovery _before_
    ACPI resources have been added, we should not "insert" the resources
    into any existing tree. If they clash with existing resources, we
    should re-allocate them (later, when we have the full resource map).

    [PATCH] PCI resource allocation re-ordering
    
    This re-orders the PCI and ACPI IO resource assignment as suggested by
    Linus.
    
    With this patch, now the sequence of reserving resources is:
     1. PCI claim BAR
     2. ACPI reserve motherboard resources
     3. PNP reserve motherboard resources
     4. PCI allocate resources for uninitialized PCI devices
    
    This way the kernel allocates new PCI resources after it has full
    knowledge of the resource state, and at the same time allows ACPI and
    PnP to be run _after_ we've filled in our knowledge about pre-allocated
    resources.
    
    The way it is done is to make the last phase of the original PCI assign
    resources code to be an 'fs_initcall', along with the ACPI and PnP
    initializations.

    [ide] ide-dma blacklist behaviour broken
    
    From: Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>
    
    The blacklist stuff is broken. When set_using_dma() calls into
    ->ide_dma_check(), it returns __ide_dma_off() for a blacklisted drive.
    This of course succeeds, returning success to the caller of ->ide_dma_check().
    Not so good... It then uncondtionally calls ->ide_dma_on(), which turns on
    DMA for the drive.
    
    This moves the check to __ide_dma_on() so we also catch the buggy
    ->ide_dma_check() defined by various chipset drivers.

    Changes to previous patch:
    - reorganized file structure. We now have common.c which shares stuff
      common to all h720x processors and cpu-h720[12].c files for the cpu
      specific stuff
    - fixed timer handling for timers 1/2
    - cleaned up h720x register definitions and splitted in files specific
      to each cpu and one generic part

    [PCMCIA] Improve locking for memory resource probing.
    
    - Pass a mask of the regions we wish to be probed to validate_mem
    - Only take s->skt_sem if we need to probe resources on a socket
    
    This prevents a deadlock reported by Adam Belay caused by ds.c waiting
    with the socket semaphore held for userspace to respond.  Meanwhile,
    userspace may under some rare circumstances issue a request to read
    tuples from the card, which tries to take the socket semaphore again.

    [PATCH] PPC64 Replace cmp instructions with cmpw/cmpd
    
    There were a few places in assembly code in the ppc64 part of the
    kernel where we were using the old forms of the compare instruction
    (cmp, cmpi, cmpl, cmpli) which don't specify the operand size (word or
    doubleword).  These have been accepted for a long time for backward
    compatibility with the old POWER architecture (and defaulted to a
    32-bit comparison) but are now being rejected by the latest versions
    of binutils.  Some of them were actual bugs in that they were on
    things which were actually 64-bit values such as pointers (not that
    any of them actually caused a problem in practice).
    
    This patch replaces cmp{,l}{,i} with cmp{,l}[wd]{,i} as appropriate.
    The original patch was from Segher Boessenkool, slightly modified by
    me.

    Currently hostfs passes the rdev value from stat() on the host as rdev
    value to return to stat() on the guest; but we cannot pass rdev as is
    because glibc and the kernel disagree about its definition.  So we must
    decode it in a major/minor couple with glibc macros and re-encode it in
    kernelspace code.

    [PATCH] uml: fix fd leak with HostFs
    
    On 2.4 we used force_delete() to make sure inode were not cached, and we then

    "force_delete" thing was dropped, and this patch adds a fix for this (by
    setting drop_inode = generic_delete_inode).
    
    Search for drop_inode in the 2.6 Documentation/filesystems/vfs.txt for info

    [PATCH] cdrom generic_packet oops fix
    
    Add dummy ->generic_packet() for devices that don't provide one.  It will
    error all commands with "unknown opcode" 0x05/0x20/0x00 sense and return
    -EIO.

    [PATCH] vmscan: handle empty zones
    
    There's a lockup condition where kswapd ensounters an empty zone which has all
    its metadata set to zero.
    
    Fix that by adding explicit checks for empty zones and just skip over them.

    [PATCH] Use cache_decay_ticks instead of a constant
    
    This patch, based on Ken Chen's patch, changes the default 2.5 msec
    migration-cutoff value to be based on cache_decay_ticks, which is what
    we used for a long time prior the sched-domains code.  (If an
    architecture does not set cache_decay_ticks then 2.5 msec is used.)
    
    This causes the following new migration-cutoff values on various SMP
    systems:
    
     x86, variable:
    
     2-way celeron 466MHz, 128K:        2.5 msec ->  1.0 msec
     2-way/4-way 2.2 GHz P4 Xeon 1MB:   2.5 msec ->  2.0 msec
     8-way P3 700 MHz Xeon 2MB:         2.5 msec ->  6.0 msec
    
     x64, variable:
    
     amd64: 2.0 GHz, 1MB:               2.5 msec -> 1.5 msec
     em64t: 3.4 GHz, 1MB:               2.5 msec -> 3.0 msec
    
     ppc64 [*]:                         2.5 msec -> 2.5 msec (constant)
    
     ia64:                              2.5 msec -> 10.0 msec (constant)
    
        [*] ppc64 does not set cache_decay_ticks so we fall back to the
            default.
    
    I believe in light of previous testing we could attempt this for 2.6.9 as
    well.  (Note: that the 2.6.9-rc3 patch looks similar but needs to patch
    kernel/sched.c.  Note2: this patch is different from Ken's original one.)

    Patch from Ian Campbell
    
    Arecent changeset[0] that changed params into an asm function call
    broke the PXA build since PXA does not define PARAMS_PHYS therefore
    the params_phys variable is never defined and linking arch/arm/boot/compressed/head.S fails.
    
    The function is defined in include/asm-arm/arch-rpc/uncompress.h

    [PATCH] x86_64: make in_gate_vma() safer
    
    x86-64 in_gate_vma would take a read lock on the VMA when the passed
    address was inside the 32bit vsyscall page.
    
    This would be called by get_user_pages, which already holds the mmap_sem.
    
    Unfortunately some callers of get_user_pages hold the mmap_sem for writing,
    which could in theory cause a deadlock.
    
    I think it can currently not happen because the only users who hold it for
    write before calling gup() are coredump and AIO in the ring setup, and both
    should not ever access the vsyscall page.
    
    But not taking the semaphore is safer and avoid this here.

    This fixes profile_pc to work properly on x86-64 and not crash.
    
    It does now a simple backtrace to the caller of the spin lock without
    requiring a frame pointer for this.
    
    Frame pointer support has been dropped because it never worked.
    
    There is still a small race window, but the only way to avoid it would be
    to rewrite kernel/spinlock.c in assembler again.  The race will account a
    profile tick the the parent of the spinlock caller.

    [IA64] minor sparse cleanups
    
    Here are three more sparse-triggered fixes which didn't fit anywhere
    else.  The first one gets rid of some quoting in palinfo.c which
    sparse doesn't like.  This used to be necessary because GCC would
    otherwise warn about an unknown trigraph.  That's not a problem
    anymore since the kernel is now being compiled with -Wno-trigraphs.
    The efirtc.c patch is mostly sparse-annotations but also cleans up
    trailing whitespace.  Finally, the bitfields in rwlock_t are changed
    to be explicitly "unsigned" to avoid a warning from sparse (it doesn't
    like 1-bit signed bitfields in particular).

    [IA64] sparse __iomem annotations
    
    This patch adds __iomem annotations.  The only less-than-trivial part
    of the patch is the change of ipi_base_addr from "unsigned long" to
    "void __iomem *" but even that part should be safe.  The patch results
    in additional warnings from certain drivers (e.g., eepro100.c) but the
    warnings are harmless and just indicate that the offending drivers
    need to be updated for the more strict __iomem checking.  The patch
    has been boot-tested.

    This enables sparse for ia64 and adds a basic set of __user
    annotations.  Apart for sys_execve() and the uaccess.h changes, the
    patch is trivially safe.  Also note that in gcc_intrin.h, I
    changed "asm __volatile" to "asm volatile" since sparse didn't
    like the old version (and it's a "strane" version anyhow).

    [INET]: Fix ECN encapsulation.
    
    We broke ECN encapsulation in tunnels recently.
    Without this patch, even though encapusulated (inner) packet is
    'not-ECN', encapusulating (outer) packet is sent with 'ECT(0)' set.
    This is wrong and should be 'not-ECN.'
    This patch fixes up.
    
    From RFC3168:
       The full-functionality option for ECN encapsulation is to copy the
       ECN codepoint of the inside header to the outside header on
       encapsulation if the inside header is not-ECT or ECT, and to set the
       ECN codepoint of the outside header to ECT(0) if the ECN codepoint of
       the inside header is CE.

    the instruction executing at a PC which is different from
    where it would normally execute.  For example, if the
    instruction is a PC-relative branch, we have to adjust the
    final PC value.

    i386: mark do_test_wp_bit() noinline
    
    As reported by Zachary Amsden <zach@vmware.com>,
    some gcc versions will inline the function even when
    it is declared after the call-site. This particular
    function must not be inlined, since the exception
    recovery doesn't like __init sections (which the caller
    is in).

    Fix up CHECKFLAGS definitions
    
    More recent versions of sparse do not define the Linux-specific
    default defines, so we make the main Makefile default to the
    regular Linux preprocessor defines (__linux__,  linux, __STDC__
    and unix, __unix__).
    
    Also, sparse has long since fixed the default empty define to
    be "1" as in regular C, so remove the unnecessary "=1" from
    the architecture-specific sparse CHECKFLAGS.

    From: Roger Blofeld
    
    This patch modifies uart_get_divisor to select the nearest baud rate
    divider rather than the lowest.  It minimizes baud rate errors.
    
    For example, if uartclk is 33000000 and baud is 115200 the ratio is about
    17.9 The current code selects 17 (5% error) but should select 18 (0.5%
    error)

    [NET]: Fix secure tcp sequence number generation
    
    Ted's recent random.c update broke the periodic rekeying:
    schedule_work() doesn't provide synchronization. Additionally the first
    syn values after boot are generated with secret 0 - not good.
    
    Attached is a big cleanup. Linus asked me to send to to you for merging:
    
    The tcp sequence number generator needs a random seed that is reset every
    few minutes. Since the sequence numbers should be constantly increasing,
    for each rekey 2^24 is added to the sequence number.
    The actual use of the sequence number generator is lockless,
    synchronization is achieved by having two copies of the control structure.
    
    The attached patch:
    - fixes a race in rekey_seq_generator(): schedule_work doesn't
       provide synchronization.
    - Uses schedule_delayed_work() for the rekey: simplifies synchronization
       and speeds up the hot path.
    - Adds a late_initcall for the first initialization after boot.
       init_call would be too early, I've checked that the late_initcall runs
       before net/ipv4/ipconfig.c, i.e. the BOOTP/DHCP autoconfiguration.

    [NET]: Generic network statistics/estimator
    
    Work done by Thomas Graf <tgraf@suug.ch> and
    Jamal Hadi Salim <hadi@cyberus.ca>
    
    The following patchset introduces generic network statistics for
    netlink users. It uses nested TLV which prevents further compatibility
    problems when introducing new statistics. Backward compatibility to
    existing TLV types TCA_STATS and TCA_XSTATS is ensured but can be
    easly removed once it is no longer needed. Therefore prior users of
    struct tc_stats can be converted to this API and existing userspace
    applications will not notice a difference while converted applications
    can use the new extendable statistic interface.
    
    Changes:
    - Add generic network statistics API for netlink users.
    - Introduces a generic rate estimator based on timers. Patch is based
      on Jamals patch and adapted to the new generic network statistics
      API.
    - Add documentation of generic network statistics and estimator API.

    [NET]: Fix fddi_statistics for 64-bit
    
     There is a problem with "struct fddi_statistics" for 64-bit systems.
    The starting members of the struct are expected to correspond to the
    respective members of "struct net_device_stats" (drivers for FDDI
    devices return "struct fddi_statistics" in the response to the
    get_stats() call of "struct net_device").  Unfortunately, due to using
    different types (u32 vs ulong) they do not.  "struct net_device_stats"
    is a public interface and as a result, bogus results are retrieved,
    e.g. for /proc/net/dev.
    
     Here is my proposal to address the problem.  I think there is no
    point in duplicating the layout of "struct net_device_stats" in
    "struct fddi_statistics" as the former can simply be included as a
    member avoiding this problem and actually any possible discrepancy in
    the future.  This also preserves the layout of the structure for
    32-bit systems.

    [IA64] perfmon2 fasync fix
    
    the pfm_fasync() function must not lock the context and mask interrupts
    because the fasync_helper() function may allocate memory and this could
    lead to sleeping, due to SLAB_KERNEL memory type, if no memory is available.
    Going to sleep with interrupts mask is not allowed otherwise you have a deadlock.
    The locking of the context is not necessary in this function because it is protected
    by caller via get_fd()/put_fd(). The async_queue is also protected. Serialization to
    pfm_fasync() is also ensured by caller. The fix is to drop the PROTECT_CTX()
    and UNPROTECT_CTX() calls.

    [PATCH] via-velocity: removal of incomplete endianness handling
    
    Removed cpu_to_le32 call on OWNED_BY_NIC. This will produce 0x01000000 on
    big endian machines while rdesc0.owner still evaluates to 0x00000000 or
    0x00000001. BTW, unless we reorder bit fields on big endian machines or
    use u32's and cpu_to_le32'd bit mask macros, current code won't work on big
    endian machines.

    Modified to invoke init_cam_filter() first. Also, clear_isr() is called

    [PATCH] via-velocity: received ring wrong index and missing barriers
    
    There were several receive ring related bugs.
    
    In velocity_give_many_rx_descs(), index calculation was incorrect.
    This and bugs in velocity_rx_srv() described in the following paragraph
    caused packet loss, truncation and infinite error interrupt generation.
    
    In velocity_rx_srv(), velocity_rx_refill() could be called without any
    dirty slot.  With proper timing, This can result in refilling yet
    unreceived packets and pushing dirty pointer ahead of the current pointer.
    And vptr->rd_curr which is used by velocity_rx_refill() was updated after
    calling velocity_rx_refill() thus screwing receive descriptor ring.
    Also, between checking owner and reading the packet, rmb() is missing.

    [PATCH] via-velocity: velocity_give_rx_desc() removal
    
    In velocity_give_rx_desc(), there should be a wmb() between resetting the
    first four bytes of rdesc0 and setting owner. As resetting the first four
    bytes isn't necessary, I just removed the function and directly set owner.
    Another rationale for removing the function:
    The function doesn't handle synchronization. We should do wmb() before
    calling the function.  So, I think using bare assignment makes the fact
    more explicit.

    [PATCH] olympic driver: fix kernel oops on lobe fault
    
    It fixes an oops that results when a lobe fault is detected.  The oops
    occurs because a lobe fault triggers an interrupt which is handled
    in the current version of the driver by effectively shutting down the
    card, and freeing its requisite irq.  The former is fine, the latter
    is not, as its illegal to free an irq from within an interrupt context.
    
    I've fixed this bug by removing the call to free_irq from the interrupt
    handler (specifically the chunk around line 964 fixes that).  While I
    was in there I noticed that there were several other conditions in
    the interrupt handler that contained the same condition, so I made
    the same fix there.  I re-added.
    
    I also modified the contents of olympic_freemem (the chunk around line
    898 to correct a misuse of a pointer after it requisite memory has
    been free in the case the the adapter is re-initalized after a fault
    to prevent that oops.  And then I clean up the interrupt handler to
    simply use olympic_freemem from the close routine since the ring buffer
    doesn't need to be freed until the driver is closed.
    
    In addition to these changes I added a call to olympic init in
    olympic_open and reset the spinlock so the adapter can be reset and
    rejoin the ring without needing to rmmod/insmod the module.  Lastly I
    cleaned up the wait queue code so that the close routine didn't have
    to wait 60 seconds to close the adapter if a fatal fault has closed
    the adapter.

    [PATCH] Avoid unnecessary copy for EPOLL_CTL_DEL
    
    Ulrich Drepper points out that EPOLL_CTL_DEL doesn't need to copy any of
    the hash events.
    
    Also, we should specify in the man pages that a NULL is allowed in
    EPOLL_CTL_DEL.  Currently it does not say that.
    
    Also, starting from when epoll uses rbtrees instead of hashes, the
    'size' hint passed to epoll_create(2) is no more used.  But since an API
    change has clearly to be excluded, I guess it'll stay as is.

    [PATCH] vm: prevent kswapd pageout priority windup
    
    Now that we are correctly kicking off kswapd early (before the synch
    reclaim watermark), it is really doing asynchronous pageout.  This has
    exposed a latent problem where allocators running at the same time will
    make kswapd think it is getting into trouble, and cause too much swapping
    and suboptimal behaviour.
    
    This patch changes the kswapd scanning algorithm to use the same metrics
    for measuring pageout success as the synchronous reclaim path - namely, how
    much work is required to free SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX pages.
    
    This should make things less fragile all round, and has the added benefit
    that kswapd will continue running so long as memory is low and it is
    managing to free pages, rather than going through the full priority loop,
    then giving up.  Should result in much better behaviour all round,
    especially when there are concurrent allocators.
    
    akpm: the patch was confirmed to fix up the excessive swapout which Ray Bryant
    <raybry@sgi.com> has been reporting.

    [PATCH] random driver preempt robustness
    
    A certain codepath in the random driver relied on vt_ioctl() being under
    the BKL and implicitly disabling preemption.  The code wasn't buggy

    [PATCH] Fix booting on some recent G5s
    
    Some recent G5s have a problem with PCI/HT probing.  They crash (machine
    check) during the probe of some slot numbers, it seems to be related to
    some functions beeing disabled by the firmware inside the K2 ASIC.
    
    This patch limits the config space accesses to devices that are present
    in the OF device-tree.  This fixes the problem and shouldn't "add" any
    limitation.  If you plug a "random" PCI card with no OF driver, the
    firmware will still build a node for it with the default set of
    properties created from the config space.

    A threaded app that posix-locks and closes the same file

    [PATCH] Update termios to use per tty semaphore
    
    This makes the agreed change of termios locking to be semaphore based
    sleep locking. This is needed for USB in particular as it has to use
    messaging to issue terminal mode changes.
    
    This code passes Torvalds test grades 0, 1 and 2 (it looks ok, it
    compiles and it booted). It does mean that a driver cannot take an
    atomic peek at termios data during an interrupt. Nobody seems to be
    doing this although some of the driver receive paths for line
    disciplines will eventually want to (n_tty currently doesn't do this
    locked on the receive path). Since the ldisc is given a chance to copy
    any essential bits on the ->set_termios path this seems not to be a
    problem.

    [PATCH] Race with iput and umount
    
    Jeff Mahoney notes:
    
     "generic_shutdown_super() will happily call the ->put_super fs method,
      destroying data structures still in use by the iput (->delete_inode)
      in progress.
    
      The unlink path will call the ->unlink fs method, release the path
      (thus dropping the reference to the vfsmount, and then call iput.
      Since the vfsmount reference is dropped back to 1, a umount will
      succeed, causing the superblock to be cleaned up."
    
    Arrgh...  Here's the trivial fix: do the final "iput()" a bit earlier in
    the unlink path.
    
    Note: all places that go to exit1: or exit: will have NULL inode, so we
    are not leaking anything here and it is OK do that iput() early; indeed,
    the goal of that kludge was to postpone the final iput() past the
    unlocking the parent for the sake of contention if a wunch of bankers is
    doing parallel unlink() on files in the same directory and normally it
    would happen on dput() after vfs_unlink())

    From: Carsten Haustein <chaus@cs.uni-potsdam.de>
    
    A bug in function piix_config_drive_xfer_rate() allows a call of
    hwif->ide_dma_on(drive) without prior call of piix_config_drive_for_dma().
    This results in harddisk configured for UDMA (default?) whereas the highest
    DMA mode supported by PIIX3 is MWORD2.
    
    This bug is supposed to be present in any 2.6.x kernel release and any
    2.4.x kernel release since 2.4.21.

    [PATCH] ppc64: change bad choice of VSID_MULTIPLIER
    
    We recently changed the VSID allocation on PPC64 to use a new scheme
    based on a multiplicative hash.  It turns out our choice of multiplier
    (the largest 28-bit prime) wasn't so great: with large contiguous
    mappings, we can get very poor hash scattering.  In particular earlier
    machines (without 16M pages) which had a reasonable about of RAM (>2G
    or so) wouldn't boot, because the linear mapping overflowed some hash
    buckets.
    
    This patch changes the multiplier to something which seems to work
    better (it is, rather arbitrarily, the median of the primes between
    2^27 and 2^28).  Some more theory should almost certainly go into the
    choice of this constant, to avoid more pathological cases.  But for
    now, this choice fixes a serious bug, and seems to do at least as well
    at scattering as the old choice on a handful of simple testcases.

    of the connection for TCP segmentation, we were using

    If we read and write the PROM chips at the same time, as might happen at boot
    when salinfo extracts MCA records and a user is checking the PROM revision
    in /proc/sgi_prominfo, an MCA might occur, since the PROM chips can't be
    accessed that way.  This patch fixes the problem for systems with new PROMs

    [PATCH] Fix disconnected dentries on NFS exports
    
    A disconnected dentry can hold an inode active after the last link has
    been removed.  The file will not then be truncated and removed until
    memory pressure flushes the disconnected dentry from the dcache.
    
    This problem can be resolved by making sure that an inode never has
    both a connected and a disconnected dentry.
    
    This is already the case for directories (as they must only have one
    dentry), but it is not the case for non-directories.
    
    This addresses it by:
     - changes d_alloc_anon to make sure that a new disconnected dentry is
       only allocated if there is currently no (hashed) dentry for the
       inode. (Previously this would noramlly be true, but a race was
       possible).
     - changes d_splice_alias to re-use a disconnected dentry on
       non-directories as well as directories.
     - splits most of d_find_alias out into a separate function to make
       the above easier.
    
    Problem originally reported by Nikita Danilov.
    
    Acked by Al Viro ("It looks sane"), and Jakob Oestergaard reports this
    fixes his problems. Further pushed by Christoph Hellwig.

    [PATCH] tty locking cleanup and fixes
    
    No problems reported other than Linus typo in an unbuildable driver from
    the last one.
    
    This one adds tty_ldisc_flush and also makes tty_wakeup do the queue
    wake as discussed with Paul.  I've then propagated these functions
    through all the drivers.  This means most drivers don't know about the
    ldisc locking and instead call generic functions that look after it.
    The result is the removal of a lot of duplicate code both for ldisc
    referencing and historical code for handling tty ldisc wakeup semantics.
    
    A nice side effect is that by adding versions of the two helpers we can
    switch most of the drivers over before changing the core tty code if
    preferred.

    [NET]: Generic network statistics
    
    This patch moves the following files in /proc:
    	/proc/net/rt_cache_stat 	/proc/net/stat/rt_cache
    	/proc/net/ip_conntrack_stat	/proc/net/stat/ip_conntrack
    	/proc/net/arp_cache_stat	/proc/net/stat/arp_cache
    	/proc/net/clip_arp_cache_stat	/proc/net/stat/clip_arp_cache
    	/proc/net/dn_neigh_cache_stat	/proc/net/stat/dn_neigh_cache
    
    This allows a generic statistics tool to scan for all available statistics
    by doing readdir(2) on /proc/net/stat
    
    It also adds a special first 'template' line to rt_cache and ip_conntrack
    in order to facilitate compatibility once somebody adds new fields to the
    output lines.
    
    WARNING:
    	This breaks existing rtstat.c and ctstat.c userspace programs
    	(hopefully for the last time).  rtstat is non-existant or broken in
    	major distributions anyway, and ctstat is too new for any distros
    	having it picked up.  Therefore, we justify this breakage.
    
    A new unified statistics tool for routing cache, connection tracking and
    neighbour cache is under development and will be included with iproute2.

    I got this patch from Zou Nan hai to resolve the problem that
    Andrew Morton has been having booting his ia64 system.  The code
    is quite a bit cleaner as he has reduced the number of different
    definitions of pfn_valid/page_to_pfn/pfn_to_page, and left the
    only remaining ones next to each other in page.h ... so this
    should be easier to maintain going forward.

    There's an issue with bio_uncopy_user() in that it expects ->bv_len to
    be untouched from io submission to io completion, which it wont be for
    some transfer lengths on some hardware. So we end up not copying all the
    data back to user space, not so good. This patch adds a bio_map_data

    [PATCH] ppc64: Make the DART "iommu" code more generic
    
    The "DART" iommu used on Apple U3 chipset will appear into 3rd party
    products soon, thus the code shouldn't be named "pmac_*" anymore.
    
    Also, the explicit config option is no longer needed, there is no
    reason to build a PowerMac kernel without the iommu support, and
    it can always be disabled at runtime with a cmdline option for
    testing or debugging.
    
    This patch do the appropriate renaming and makes the config option
    implicit & selected when pmac support is included.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Remote some userland-only stuff from kernel header
    
    include/asm-ppc64/systemcfg.h defines a structure that currently gets
    exposed to userland via /proc, and which I intend to deprecate in the
    near future once I have better alternatives available.
    
    In the meantime, this patch removes a bunch of stuff from this file that
    were only defined for non-__KERNEL__, like an inline function for
    getting to that struture via /proc, and some CPU & platform type
    definitions that were duplicates of the ones in asm-ppc64/processor.h.
    These things have nothing to do in a kernel header.

    [PATCH] Add wait_event_timeout()
    
    There appears to be one case missing from the wait_event() family - the
    uninterruptible timeout wait.  The following patch adds this.
    
    This wait is particularly useful when (eg) you wish to pass work off to an
    interrupt handler to perform, but also want to know if the hardware has
    decided to go gaga under you.  You don't want to sit around waiting for
    something that'll never happen - you want to go and wack the gremlin which
    caused the failure and retry.

    This fixes the bug that made the card DMA lots of data to random memory
    locations, causing lockups and instant reboots.
    
    The problem was that the yoffset variable got modified inside the loop,
    but the logic in the switch statement was meant to work on the initial
    value of the yoffset variable.

    ppc: Allow the Freescale MPC52xx to NAP when idle on LITE5200 platform
    
    NAP allows some powersave. It's provided mainly as an example on how
    to do it.
    
    However, when a BDI is plugged it causes early crashes so be aware !
    You need to define CONFIG_BDI_SWITCH so powersave is disabled.

    [PATCH] fix posix_locks_deadlock()
    
    The "blocked_list" used for POSIX deadlock detection should only contain
    POSIX locks, or posix_locks_deadlock() can get confused.
    
    As I've noted before (but never posted a patch), we should probably stop
    checking for deadlock.  POSIX says it's optional for an implementation
    to check for deadlock, and since the change to match on tgid, we can
    report a deadlock when none exists.
    
    [ Further explanation for Linus: POSIX locks and BSD locks don't block
      each other, so checking that the blocker is a POSIX lock also implies
      that the waiter is a POSIX lock. ]

    [power mgmt] Make system state enums match device state values.
    
    Changes the PM_SUSPEND_MEM (and PM_SUSPEND_DISK) enum values so that
    they make sense as PCI device power states.
    
    (a) Fixes bugs whereby PCI drivers are being given bogus values.
        This should resolve OSDL bugid 2886 without changing the PCI
        API (its PM calls still act as on 2.4 kernels).
    
    (b) Doesn't change the awkward assumption in the 2.6 PMcore that
        the /sys/bus/*/devices/power/state, /proc/acpi/sleep,
        dev->power.power_state, and dev->detach_state files share
        the same numeric codes ... even for busses very unlike PCI,
        or systems with several "on" policies as well as STD and STR,
        or with device-PM transtions with no system-wide equivalent.
    
    Really we need to move away from "u32" codes that are easily confused
    with each other, towards typed values (probably struct pointers), but
    that's a long-term change and we need the PCI issue fixed sooner.

    [ARM] Fix circular include dependency in asm/system.h
    
    The recent addition of linux/bitops.h inside linux/kernel.h has

    asm/system.h -> linux/kernel.h -> linux/bitops.h -> asm/bitops.h
     -> asm/system.h
    
    which results in an unbuildable kernel.  We appear not to need
    linux/kernel.h in asm/system.h, but do need linux/linkage.h, so
    make this the case.

    [PATCH] uml: don't trash return value
    
    From: Doug Dumitru <doug@easyco.com>
    
    I have been fighting a buffering error when sending large amounts of data out
    pty devices from UML.  I have tried a couple of patches that did not really
    fix the problem (and were rightly rejected by the group), but have finally
    found the real bug.
    
    In /arch/um/drivers/line.c there is a function "buffer_data" that is
    responsible for storing data into the lines ring buffer.  The function is
    "supposed" to return the number of characters actually buffered.
    Unfortunately, in the case where the buffer wraps, the "len" variable is
    decremented by "end" before it is used as the return parameter.

    [PATCH] Fix generic direct IO code for XFS
    
    The following patch to the generic direct IO code fixes a problem we've
    come across that affects the way XFS interacts with it.  Between 2.6.5 and
    2.6.6 several changes to direct IO were made, in particular the
    fallback-to-buffered path was introduced in that timeframe.
    
    Those changes split the locking done within direct-io.c into two cases -
    generic filesystems and blkdev/XFS.  There is no locking done for the
    second case, and we also never set the create parameter to the get_blocks
    call (via direct_io_worker ->do_direct_IO->get_more_blocks) for that case.
    This meant that XFS was accidentally no longer being told when a direct IO
    write was being performed, which in turn meant that XFS would (often -
    depending on the inode's size and bmap) tell get_more_blocks that it was
    mapping to a hole.  It also means that currently all direct writes into XFS
    are falling back to buffered writes.  Further, skipping the i_alloc_sem
    locking entirely is not correct for us, we are relying on that aspect of
    the generic locking.
    
    The fallback behaviour from direct to buffered is "silent", so we didn't
    actually pick up on these problems until just recently, unfortunately.
    
    The approach I've taken here is to split the blkdev/XFS case into two, and
    corrected the new third case behaviour for the functionality XFS provides.
    The generic behavior used by other filesystems remains unchanged, as does
    direct IO to the block device, and XFS now becomes fully functional.

    changed dio_pages_in_io calculation to be exactly the number of pages we
    needed to map the user-buffer to do the IO.  But with fine-grain alignment
    (non fs-blocksize), we may need 2 more pages (ZERO_PAGE) to zero out first
    and last block if needed.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Fix warning in pmac battery code
    
    The battery calculation code in via-pmu triggers a few warnings (and
    actually, one of them would lead to a real error if we ever get an
    unrecognized type from the PMU).  Fix this.

    [PATCH] ppc32: ADB keycode conversion update
    
    This makes the ADB->Linux keycodes conversion table a lot more readable
    (and thus easy to fix :) and adds conversion of the laptop Fn-enter
    (keypad enter, also present on apple laptop keyboards on the bottom
    right, left of the arrow keys) to "compose" (or menu key on modern PC
    keyboard).
    
    Thanks to Frank Murphy <murphyf@f-m.fm> for spotting this keycode
    feature of MacOS (and apple docs)
    
    It also fixes a small possible race in the LED code

    [PATCH] ppc32: Fix Apple Xserve G4 PCI probing
    
    When pci_assign_all_busses is set, the common code will re-assign all
    the bus numbers, which we still need to do one various pmacs, at least
    until XFree/XOrg understands PCI domains properly.  However, this
    process triggers a bug if during this renumbering, on a given segment, a
    P2P bridge not yet renumbered has conflicting downstream bus range with
    a P2P bridge just renumbered.  The probing will just behave randomly and
    either miss devices, show duplicates, or just lockup in some
    circumstances.  This is typically triggered on Apple Xserve G4s who have
    at least 2 P2P bridges built-in on the same segment of the first PCI
    (non-AGP) domain
    
    The "workaround" we use on pmac that was in my tree for a while but got
    "lost" during the big merge a while ago is to offset the bus numbers
    between domains by 16.  This avoids the above collision scenario in all
    practical cases.
    
    The long term solution of course is to stop renumbering and make sure
    that all drivers are domain safe (there may be a couple issue remaining
    in the code that matches PCI / OF devices on ppc32) and XFree/XOrg has
    to be fixed.

    on each boot.  This is running ACPI and APIC on 2.6.5, 2.6.7 and 2.6.8.
    dmesg, dmidecode and /proc/acpi/dsdt are all identical (apart from dmesg
    printing of IRQ and errors it causes) regardless of whether it decides to
    go on 7 or 15.  It is now running the latest BIOS, earlier BIOS did the

    [PATCH] ppc64: monster cleanup
    
    This is the third & hopefully final version of the monster cleanup
    patch. It does significant cleanups of the early boot code of the
    ppc64 kernel, and begins the long process of cleaning up & splitting
    properly the platform support.
    
    It completely reworks the interface between the early code that is
    run in the firmware context (prom_init) and the rest of the kernel,
    in such a way that will make kexec or static device-tree for embedded
    people possible. The early init code can eventually be moved to a
    separate link entity, it no longer touches any of the kernel globals,
    everything is passed via a single blob of data in memory containing
    a flattened version of the device-tree and a memory reserve map.
    
    While doing it, I also cut the ties between pSeries and Powermac. Now,
    the kernel config provides a choice between legacy iSeries and
    "multiplatform". The later is a set of various supported platform,
    each of them beeing a boolean switch, currently defined beeing pSeries
    and PowerMac. You can enable both or just one of them. CONFIG_PPC_PSERIES
    is now specifically set for IBM pSeries support, you can build a PowerMac
    kernel without pSeries support if you which.
    The main goal here is to simplify addition of new platform types.

    [PATCH] fix problematic flush_cache_page in kernel/ptrace.c
    
    At present, flush_cache_page() is used to handle the case where we
    unmap a page or alter the page permissions on the target page with
    one exception - access_process_vm().  Based upon the former, the
    decision to implement this function is:
    
            do we need to flush the cache when we unmap or change
            the mapping permissions?
    
    However, kernel/ptrace.c: access_process_vm() also includes into this:
    
            or we need to ensure cache coherency between the kernel
            and user space mapping of this page.
    
    I argue that the use of flush_cache_page() here in the generic
    code is wrong, and if an architecture wishes to use it for this
    purpose, it should do so within it's architecture private
    implementation of copy_to_user_page() and copy_from_user_page().
    
    So this patch removes the flush_cache_page() from kernel/ptrace.c,
    adding it to the arch-specific copy_{to,from}_user_page() where
    flush_cache_page is non-empty.

    [PATCH] pmac: don't add °C suffix in sys for adt746x driver
    
    The adt746x driver currently adds a "°C" suffix to temperatures exposed via
    sysfs, and I don't like that.  First, we all agree that any other unit here
    makes no sense (do we ?  do we ?  yes of course :) and I don't like having
    anything but numbers in there, and finally it's more consistent with what
    the g5 driver does.
    
    And finally, the _REAL_ reason is that this is not a low ASCII character
    and so has nothing to do in the kernel sources or in /sys :)
    
    Unfortunately, generating a patch here is nasty because of that (my mailer
    is rightfully complaining about the non-ASCII char on text import) so you
    might have to apply by hand...

    [PATCH] fix diskstats_show() accounting with PREEMPT
    
    There is another (minor) bug that the smp_processor_id() debugger
    unearthed: diskstats_show() could do a disk_round_stats() ->
    disk_stat_add() with preemption enabled - possibly resulting in losing
    statistics updates.

    end of a file.
    
        struct flock sflp;
        sflp.l_start = 2147483345;
        sflp.l_len = 302;
        /* 2147483345 + 302 == 2147483647 (this should not overflow 31 bits) */
        /* 2^31 ==             2147483648 */
        fcntl_stat = fcntl(fd, F_GETLK, &sflp);
    
    The patch also contains a fix to handle l_len < 0 which is now defined in
    POSIX 1003.1-2001 from the fcntl man page.

    [PATCH] Fix for default ACL handling on ReiserFS
    
    reiserfs_set_xattr() explicitly updates the ctime for the host inode.
    
    This works for direct setfacl/setfattr calls, but for the more common case
    of an inherited default ACL, it breaks.  The ACL is inherited in the middle
    of the new inode creation, before the inode has been hashed.
    
    When mark_inode_dirty is called, one of the checks bails out if the inode
    is unhashed -- but AFTER inode->i_state is updated, so the inode is marked
    dirty but never placed on any dirty list.
    
    Since the inode is never placed on a dirty list, __sync_single_inode from
    the writeback_inodes() path can never be called on it to clear the dirty
    flags.  Once the inode is hashed and mark_inode_dirty is called for it
    again, it's too late -- it will bail early assuming (correctly) that the
    inode is already marked dirty.  This ultimately results in I/O stalls that
    can't be resolved by the fs path, only be the memory allocation path that
    uses pages directly.
    
    The attached patch makes the update of the ctime conditional on the inode
    being hashed already.

    [PATCH] Fix of race in writeback_inodes()
    
    This patch fixes race in writeback_inodes() described below:
    
    writeback_inodes()
    {
         ....
         sb->s_count++;
         spin_unlock(&sb_lock);
         ....
         spin_lock(&sb_lock);
         if (__put_super(sb))        <<< X
             goto restart;
         }
    }
    
    deactivate_super()
    {
         fs->kill_sb(s);
             kill_block_super(sb)
                 generic_shutdown_super(sb)
                         spin_lock(&sb_lock);
                         list_del(&sb->s_list);    <<< Y
                         spin_unlock(&sb_lock);
         ....
         put_super(s);
                 spin_lock(&sb_lock);
                 __put_super(sb);            <<< Z
                 spin_unlock(&sb_lock);
    }
    
    The problem with it is that writeback_inodes() supposes that if
    __put_super() returns 0 then no super block was deleted from the list and
    we can safely traverse sb list further.
    
    But as it is obvious from the deactivate_super() it's not actually true.
    because at point Y we delete super block from the list and drop the lock.
    We do __put_super() very much later...  So we can find sb with poisoned
    sb->s_list at point X and we won't be the last sb reference holders.  The
    last reference will be dropped in point Z.
    
    So in case of the following sequence of execution Y -> X -> Z we'll get an
    oops after point X in writeback_inodes().
    
    This patch introduces __put_super_and_need_restart() function which allows
    safe traversing of sb list.  I'll send a couple of patches later which
    remove O(n^2) algos and using this function.

    [PATCH] ppc64: User tasks must have a valid thread.regs
    
    There have been reports of problems running UP ppc64 kernels where the
    kernel would die in the floating point save/restore code.
    
    It turns out kernel threads that call exec (and so become user tasks) do
    not have a valid thread.regs.  This means init (pid 1) does not, it also
    means anything called out of exec_usermodehelper does not.  Once that task
    has forked (eg init), then the thread.regs in the new task is correctly
    set.
    
    On UP do lazy save/restore of floating point regs.  The SLES9 init is doing
    floating point (the debian version of init appears not to).  The lack of
    thread.regs in init combined with the fact that it does floating point
    leads to our lazy FP save/restore code blowing up.
    
    There were other places where this problem exhibited itself in weird and
    interesting ways.  If a task being exec'ed out of a kernel thread used more
    than 1MB of stack, it would be terminated due to the checks in
    arch/ppc64/mm/fault.c (looking for a valid thread.regs when extending the
    stack).  We had a test case using the tux webserver that was failing due to
    this.
    
    Since we zero all registers in ELF_PLAT_INIT, I removed the extra memset
    in start_thread32.

    [PATCH] ppc32: 85xx spurious interrupt bug
    
    The Spurious interrupt assignment for OpenPIC was the constant,
    OPENPIC_VEC_SPURIOUS plus the offset passed in.  Due to bugs in some
    OpenPICs, the end value needed to be 255 on those systems.  However, the
    constant was then chosen to be 239, because offset on most systems is 16.
    The 85xx has an offset of 64, however, and so this assignment caused
    lock-ups during boot.  The proposed solution is to declare
    OPENPIC_VEC_SPURIOUS to be 255, and use that value directly, instead of
    adding the offset to it.

    [PATCH] fbdev: Initialize i810fb after agpgart
    
    This patch places 'video/i810/' after 'char/' in drivers/Makefile.  This order
    change makes it unnecessary for i810fb to explicitly call agp_intel_init().
    This is untested, as I don't have any i810 hardware anymore, but I believe it
    will work.  If it does, the ugly 'early initialization hack' in
    drivers/char/agp/intel-agp.c:agp_intel_init() can be removed (haven't done it
    yet).

    [PATCH] fbcon: fix fbcon's setup routine
    
    Fix fbcon's setup routine so usage is consistent with previous kernels.
    Ie: video=ofonly and video=xxxfb:off should work.
    
    This is done by fb_get_options() returning a nonzero value if:
    
    - 'off' option is present
    - 'ofonly' is present but driver name is not 'offb'
    
    All drivers will not proceed with their initialization if return value is
    nonzero.

    [PATCH] fbdev: Fix userland compile breakage
    
    From: Michal Januszewski <spock@gentoo.org>
    
    "The latest changes introduced to the fb structs in linux/fb.h make
    compilation of userspace programs break with:
    
    include/linux/fb.h:305: error: field `modelist' has incomplete type
    
    This is caused by struct list_head not being seen from userspace."
    
    This patch removes struct list_head modelist from struct fb_monspecs and
    moves it to struct fb_info instead, and for now, enclosed struct
    fb_monspecs by #ifdef __KERNEL__/#endif.

    Get rid of IO_TOKEN_TO_ADDR() and IO_ADDR_TO_TOKEN() for pSeries EEH;
    the conversion to tokens is not needed now that we have __iomem
    annotations to prevent drivers from dereferencing IO addresses.
    
    The IO tokens meant that the __raw_ IO accesses wouldn't have worked,

    [NET]: Fix ifmap alignment issues over rtnetlink
    
    Introduces a fixed size variant of ifmap for rtnetlink. Fixes
    issues with address size mismatch between kernel and userspace.
    Obviously this will fail if userspace provides an address greater
    than 32bit.

Author: Alexander Viro <viro@www.linux.org.uk>
Date:   Tue Sep 21 02:52:59 2004 -0700

    [PATCH] cifs: assorted endianness bugfixes
    
            a) Flags2 left little-endian. SMBFLG2_... definitions switched to
    cpu_to_le16(...), which kills the need of conversions in ->Flags2.
    	b) FILE_SYSTEM_UNIX_INFO (never used anywhere) is left little-endian;
    when users appear, they can convert themselves.
    	c) bugfix: in CIFSSessSetup() we used SecurityBlobLength of response
    without conversion.  That would screw bigendian clients with servers that
    give wcnt=4.
    	d) bugfix: in CIFSNTLMSSPNegotiateSessSetup() we use
    SecurityBlob2->NegotiateFlags without conversion.  Again, problem on
    big-endian.
    	e) bugfix: SecurityBlob->MessageType is *not* host-endian.
    	f) bugfix: ->sendmsg() expects its last argument to be equal to sum
    of iovec lengths, so the value passed to kernel_sendmsg()/sock_sendmsg()
    would better be correct...

    Disable syscalls sys32_iopl() and sys32_ioperm() on ia64.
    To emulate these 2 syscalls correctly, we need to guarantee uncached
    memory attributes on ia64, which is difficult. The only user of this
    interface that we know of is X. So we think it's better to disable it.

    These facilities are now available by default.
    The config option makes no sense because:
    1) It makes no change to the layout of any
       data structure, therefore it has no impact
       upon memory usage of the routing tables.
    2) It makes no significant change to code size,
       only a handfull of lookup comparisons are
       protected by the option.
    3) It is needed for full RFC1812 compliance anyways.

    [PATCH] Warn that ipchains and ipfwadm are going away
    
    At the recent netfilter workshop in Erlangen, we was decided to remove
    the backwards compatibility code for ipchains and ipfwadm.  This will
    allow significant cleanup of interfaces, since we had to have a
    mid-level interface for the backwards compatibility layer to use.
    
    Start off with a warning for 2.6.9, so any remaining users have a chance
    to migrate.  Their firewall scripts might not check return values, and
    they might get a nasty surprise when this goes away.

    [MMC] Clean up MMC card CID/CSD decoding, stage 1.
    
    Now that the raw CSD and CID information are available in mmc_card,
    there's little point not passing the mmc_card structure into the
    decode functions themselves.
    
    This will be necessary, since there's several different formats of
    CID decode, and the format appears to depend on data in the CSD.
    
    If we are unable to decode the CID or CSD, we can mark the card bad
    and refuse to bind it to any drivers.  Users can then retrieve the
    raw undecoded CID and CSD from sysfs for debugging purposes.

    [PATCH] uml: iomem fix

    [PATCH] uml: eliminate signal order delivery dependency
    
    On 2.4 hosts signals are delivered in numeric order when there are multiple
    pending at a given time.  UML developed a subtle dependency on this
    ordering, which broke on 2.6 hosts and the separate process and thread
    signal queues.
    
    This patch eliminates that dependency.

    [PATCH] uml: let page faults always be delivered immediately
    
    This allows page faults to be delivered when they happen.  Without this, it
    can happen that a page fault will occur when SIGSEGV is disabled, and the
    host will then just kill UML because it can't invoke the handler.

    [PATCH] device driver for the SGI system clock, mmtimer
    
    SGI has been using this driver under Linux since 2001 but it was
    never included in the upstream kernel. SuSE did include the patch for mmtimer
    in SLES 9. The driver has been widely used for applications on the Altix
    platform.
    
    The timer hardware was designed around the multimedia timer specification by
    Intel but to my knowledge only SGI has implemented that standard. The driver
    was written by Jesse Barnes.
    
    The second revision has interrupt support removed and was somewhat simplified
    by removing one include file.

    [PATCH] serial-cs and unusable port size ranges
    
    A couple of GSM GPRS PCMCIA cards advertise 16 rather than 8 port sized
    windows for their serial interface.  This breaks our current pcmcia serial
    driver which ignores any windows that are not 8 bytes.
    
    To avoid any regressions on other cards given this driver contains a
    certain amount of "magic" the patch below looks for 8 byte windows first so
    will not break existing supported cards (I hope ;))

    [PATCH] fix for fsync ignoring writing errors
    
    Currently metadata writing errors are ignored and not returned from
    sys_fsync on ext2 and ext3 filesystems.  That is, at least ext2 and ext3.
    
    Both ext2 and ext3 resort to sync_inode() in their ->sync_inode method,
    which in turn calls ->write_inode.  ->write_inode method has void type, and
    any IO errors happening inside are lost.
    
    Make ->write_inode return the error code?

    [PATCH] x86-64: sibling map fix for clustered mode
    
    From: James Cleverdon
    
    The value that cpuinfo returns for command 1 in ebx is the physical APIC ID
    latched when the system comes out of reset.
    
    Ordinarily, this is identical to the value in the local APIC's ID register,
    because nearly all BIOSes accept the HW assigned value.
    
    Our systems, made up of individual building blocks, can't do that.  Each
    node boots as a separate system and is joined together by the BIOS.  Thus,
    the BIOS rewrites the local APIC ID register with a new value.
    
    Potomac and Nocona chips have a mechanism by which the BIOS writer can
    change bits 7:5 to match the assigned cluster ID.  Bits 2:0 come from the
    thread ID.  However, bits 4:3 are still those latched at reset.  Oops!
    
    Summary: Large clustered systems can't use cpuid to derive the sibling
    information.
    
    Fix: Use the local APIC ID.  That's the value we use to online the CPUs, so
    it had better be OK.  For non-clustered systems, cpuid == local APIC, so
    nothing but large boxes should be affected.

    Replace the mmu_context_queue structure with the idr allocator.  The
    mmu_context_queue allocation was quite large (~200kB) so on most machines
    we will have a reduction in usage.
    
    We might put a single entry cache on the front of this so we are more
    likely to reuse ppc64 MMU hashtable entries that are in the caches.

    [PATCH] fix posix-timers leak
    
    Exec fails to clean up posix-timers.  This manifests itself in two ways, one
    worse than the other.  In the single-threaded case, it just fails to clear out
    the timers on exec.  POSIX says that exec clears out the timers from
    timer_create (though not the setitimer ones), so it's wrong that a lingering
    timer could fire after exec and kill the process with a signal it's not
    expecting.  In the multi-threaded case, it not only leaves lingering timers,
    but it leaks them entirely when it replaces signal_struct, so they will never
    be freed by the process exiting after that exec.  The new per-user
    RLIMIT_SIGPENDING actually limits the damage here, because a UID will fill up
    its quota with leaked timers and then never be able to use timer_create again
    (that's what my test program does).  But if you have many many untrusted UIDs,
    this leak could be considered a DoS risk.

    [PATCH] x86 TSS: io port caching
    
    There's one additional step we can do ontop of the ports-max code to get rid
    of copying in X.org's case: cache the last task that set up the IO bitmap.
    This means we can set the offset to invalid and keep the IO bitmap of that
    task, and switch back to a valid offset (without any copying) when switching
    back to that task.  (or do a copy if there is another ioperm task we switch
    to.)
    
    I've attached ioport-cache-2.6.8.1.patch that implements this. When
    there's a single active ioperm() using task in the system then the
    context-switch overhead is very low and constant:
    
     # ./ioperm-latency
     default no ioperm:             scheduling latency: 2478 cycles
     turning on port 80 ioperm:     scheduling latency: 2499 cycles
     turning on port 65535 ioperm:  scheduling latency: 2481 cycles
    
    This single-ioperm-user situation matches 99% of the actual ioperm()
    usage scenarios and gets rid of any copying whatsoever - without relying
    on any fault mechanism. I can see no advantage of the GPF approach over
    this patch.

    [PATCH] hvc_console fix to protect hvc_write against ldisc write after hvc_close
    
    Due to the tty ldisc code not stopping write operations against a driver
    even after a tty has been closed I added a mechanism to hvc_console in my
    previous patch to prevent this by nulling out the tty->driver_data in
    hvc_close() but I forgot to check tty->driver_data in hvc_write().  Anton
    Blanchard got several oops'es from hvc_write() accessing NULL as if it were
    a pointer to an hvc_struct usually stored in tty->driver_data.
    
    So this patch checks tty->driver_data in hvc_write() before it is used.
    Hopefully once Alan Cox's patch is checked in ldisc writes won't continue
    to happen after tty closes.
    
    Anton Blanchard has tested this patch and is unable to reproduce the oops
    with it applied.
    
    Changelog:
    
    drivers/char/hvc_console.c
    
    - Added comment to hvc_close() to explain the reason for NULLing
      tty->driver_data.
    
    - Added check to hvc_write() to verify that tty->driver_data is valid
      (NOT NULL) which would be the case if the write operation was invoked
      after a tty close was initiated on the tty.

    [IA64] SGI Altix hardware performance monitoring API
    
    
    The SGI Altix PROM supports a SAL call for performance monitoring and for
    exporting NUMA topology. We need this in community kernels for diagnostic
    and performance tools to use, especially on very large machines.
    
    This patch registers a dynamic misc device "sn_hwperf" that supports an
    ioctl interface for reading/writing memory mapped registers on Altix
    nodes and routers via the new SAL call. It also creates a read-only
    procfs file "/proc/sgi_sn/sn_topology" to export NUMA topology and Altix
    hardware inventory.
    
    > What tools are using this?
    
    Performance Co-Pilot http://oss.sgi.com/projects/pcp  in particular,
    pmshub, shubstats and linkstat. Numerous other users include anything
    that needs knowledge of numa topology/interconnect in order to perform
    well, e.g. mpt. BTW I have not exported any API functions .. at this
    point I don't think we need any modules to call the API.

    [IPSEC]: Implement DSCP decapsulation
    
    This patch adds DSCP decapsulation for IPsec.  This is enabled by
    a per-state flag which is off by default.  Leaving it off by default
    maintains compatibility and is also good for performance reasons.
    
    I decided to not implement a toggle on the output path since not
    encapsulating the DSCP can and should be done by netfilter.

    [PATCH] matroxfb update + sparse annotations
    
    This change switches matroxfb on x86 and x86_64 from dereferencing
    pointers to {read,write}[bwl], as __pa() are gone from them, and so gcc
    does not need an additional register for preserving address between
    consecutive {read,write}[bwl].
    
    Then it switches only supported architecture left (ppc/ppc64/arm) from
    dereferencing pointers to __raw_{read,write}[bwl].
    
    Third part is fixing sparse complaints: add __iomem here and there, and
    switch one 1bit bitfield from int to unsigned int.
    
    After this there should be no sparse complaints in matroxfb.

    [PATCH] back out siginfo_t.si_rusage from waitid changes
    
    As I explained in the waitid patches, I added the si_rusage field to
    siginfo_t with the idea of having the siginfo_t waitid fills in contain all
    the information that wait4 or any such call could ever tell you.  Nowhere
    in POSIX nor anywhere else specifies this field in siginfo_t.
    
    When Ulrich and I hashed out the system call interface we wanted, we looked
    at siginfo_t and decided there was plenty of space to throw in si_rusage.
    Well, it turns out we didn't check the 64-bit platforms.  There struct
    rusage is ridiculously large (lots of longs for things that are never in a
    million years going to hit 2^32), and my changes bumped up the size of
    siginfo_t.  Changing that size is more trouble than it's worth.
    
    This patch reverts the changes to the siginfo_t structure types,
    and no longer provides the rusage details in SIGCHLD signal data.
    Instead, I added a fifth argument to the waitid system call to fill in rusage.
    
    waitid is the name of the POSIX function with four arguments.  It might
    make sense to rename the system call `waitsys' to follow SGI's system call
    with the same arguments, or `wait5' in the mindless tradition.  But, feh.
    I just added the argument to sys_waitid, rather than worrying about
    changing the name in all the tables (and choosing a new stupid name).

    [IPV4]: Make fib_semantics algorithms scale better.
    
    A singly linked list was previously used to
    do fib_info object lookup for various actions
    in the routing code.  This does not scale very
    well with many devices and even a moderate number
    of routes.  This was noted by Benjamin Lahaise.
    
    To fix all of this we use 3 hash tables, two of
    which grow dynamically as the number fib_info
    objects increases while the final one is fixes in
    size.
    
    The statically sized table hashes on device index.
    This is used for fib_sync_down, fib_sync_up, and
    ip_fib_check_default.
    
    The first dynamically sized table is keyed on
    protocol, prefsrc, and priority.  This is used
    by fib_create_info() to look for existing fib_info
    objects matching the new one being constructed.
    
    The last dynamically sized table is keyed on
    the preferred source of the route if it has one
    specified.  This is used by fib_sync_down when
    a local address disappears.
    
    There are still some scalability problems for
    Bens test case in fib_hash.c and I will try to
    attack those next.

    [PATCH] i386: elf_read_implies_exec() fixup
    
    The final ia64 related cleanup to elf_read_implies_exec() seems to have
    broken it.  The effect is that the READ_IMPLIES_EXEC flag is never set
    for !pt_gnu_stack binaries!
    
    That's a bit more secure than we need to be, and might break some legacy
    app that doesn't expect it.

    [PATCH] uml: fix scheduler race
    
    This fixes a use-after-free bug in the context switching.  A process going
    out of context after exiting wakes up the next process and then kills
    itself.  The problem is that when it gets around to killing itself is up to
    the host and can happen a long time later, including after the incoming
    process has freed its stack, and that memory is possibly being used for
    something else.
    
    The fix is to have the incoming process kill the exiting process just to
    make sure it can't be running at the point that its stack is freed.

    [PATCH] HVCS fix to replace yield with tty_wait_until_sent in hvcs_close
    
    Following the same advice you gave in a recent hvc_console patch I have
    modified HVCS to remove a while() { yield(); } from hvcs_close() which may
    cause problems where real time scheduling is concerned and replaced it with
    tty_wait_until_sent() which uses a real wait queue and is the proper method
    for blocking a tty operation while waiting for data to be sent.  This patch
    has been tested to verify that all the paths of code that were changed were
    hit during the code run and performed as expected including hotplug remove
    of hvcs adapters and hangup of ttys.
    
    - Replaced yield() in hvcs_close() with tty_wait_until_sent() to prevent
      possible lockup with realtime scheduling.
    
    - Removed hvcs_final_close() and reordered cleanup operations to prevent
      discarding of pending data during an hvcs_close() call.
    
    - Removed spinlock protection of hvcs_struct data members in
      hvcs_write_room() and hvcs_chars_in_buffer() because they aren't needed.

    [PATCH] blk: max_sectors tunables
    
    Introduces two new /sys/block values:
    
      /sys/block/*/queue/max_hw_sectors_kb
      /sys/block/*/queue/max_sectors_kb
    
    max_hw_sectors_kb is the maximum that the driver can handle and is
    readonly.  max_sectors_kb is the current max_sectors value and can be tuned
    by root.  PAGE_SIZE granularity is enforced.
    
    It's all locking-safe and all affected layered drivers have been updated as
    well.  The patch has been in testing for a couple of weeks already as part
    of the voluntary-preempt patches and it works just fine - people use it to
    reduce IDE IRQ handling latencies.

    [PATCH] Add prctl to modify current->comm
    
    This patch adds a prctl to modify current->comm as shown in /proc.  This
    feature was requested by KDE developers.  In KDE most programs are started by
    forking from a kdeinit program that already has the libraries loaded and some
    other state.
    
    Problem is to give these forked programs the proper name.  It already writes
    the command line in the environment (as seen in ps), but top uses a different
    field in /proc/pid/status that reports current->comm.  And that was always
    "kdeinit" instead of the real command name.  So you ended up with lots of
    kdeinits in your top listing, which was not very useful.
    
    This patch adds a new prctl PR_SET_NAME to allow a program to change its comm
    field.
    
    I considered the potential security issues of a program obscuring itself with
    this interface, but I don't think it matters much because a program can
    already obscure itself when the admin uses ps instead of top.  In case of a
    KDE desktop calling everything kdeinit is much more obfuscation than the
    alternative.

    [PATCH] shmem: avoid the shmem_inodes list
    
    If we're thinking about shmem scalability...  isn't it silly that each shmem
    object is added to the shmem_inodes list on creation, and removed on deletion,
    yet the only use for that list is in swapoff (shmem_unuse)?
    
    Call it shmem_swaplist; shmem_writepage add inode to swaplist when first swap
    allocated (usually never); shmem_delete_inode remove inode from the list after
    truncating (if called before, inode could be re-added to it).
    
    Inode can remain on the swaplist after all its pages are swapped back in, just
    be lazy about it; but if shmem_unuse finds swapped count now 0, save itself
    time by then removing that inode from the swaplist.

    [PATCH] shmem: no sbinfo for tmpfs mount?
    
    Some might want a tmpfs mount with the improved scalability afforded by
    omitting shmem superblock accounting; or some might just want to test it in an
    externally-visible tmpfs mount instance.
    
    Adopt the convention that mount option -o nr_blocks=0,nr_inodes=0 means
    without resource limits, and hence no shmem_sb_info.  Not recommended for
    general use, but no worse than ramfs.
    
    Disallow remounting from unlimited to limited (no accounting has been done so
    far, so no idea whether it's permissible), and from limited to unlimited
    (because we'd need then to free the sbinfo, and visit each inode to reset its
    i_blocks to 0: why bother?).

    [PATCH] shmem: no sbinfo for shm mount
    
    SGI investigations have shown a dramatic contrast in scalability between
    anonymous memory and shmem objects.  Processes building distinct shmem objects
    in parallel hit heavy contention on shmem superblock stat_lock.  Across 256
    cpus an intensive test runs 300 times slower than anonymous.
    
    Jack Steiner has observed that all the shmem superblock free_blocks and
    free_inodes accounting is redundant in the case of the internal mount used for
    SysV shared memory and for shared writable /dev/zero objects (the cases which
    most concern them): it specifically declines to limit.
    
    Based upon Brent Casavant's SHMEM_NOSBINFO patch, this instead just removes
    the shmem_sb_info structure from the internal kernel mount, testing where
    necessary for null sbinfo pointer.  shmem_set_size moved within CONFIG_TMPFS,
    its arg named "sbinfo" as elsewhere.
    
    This brings shmem object scalability up to that of anonymous memory, in the
    case where distinct processes are building (faulting to allocate) distinct
    objects.  It significantly improves parallel building of a shared shmem object
    (that test runs 14 times faster across 256 cpus), but other issues remain in
    that case: to be addressed in later patches.

    [PATCH] shmem: inodes and links need lowmem
    
    Keith Mannthey's Bugzilla #3268 drew attention to how tmpfs inodes and
    dentries and long names and radix-tree nodes pin lowmem.  Assuming about 1k of
    lowmem per inode, we need to lower the default nr_inodes limit on machines
    with significant highmem.
    
    Be conservative, but more generous than in the original patch to Keith: limit
    to number of lowmem pages, which works out around 200,000 on i386.  Easily
    overridden by giving the nr_inodes= mount option: those who want to sail
    closer to the rocks should be allowed to do so.
    
    Notice how tmpfs dentries cannot be reclaimed in the way that disk-based
    dentries can: so even hard links need to be costed.  They are cheaper than
    inodes, but easier all round to charge the same.  This way, the limit for hard
    links is equally visible through "df -i": but expect occasional bugreports
    that tmpfs links are being treated like this.
    
    Would have been simpler just to move the free_inodes accounting from
    shmem_delete_inode to shmem_unlink; but that would lose the charge on unlinked
    but open files.

    Was saying SLAB_RECLAIM_ACCOUNT too, but that's wrong: tmpfs inodes are not
    reclaimed under pressure; and hugetlbfs had copied that too.
    
    Rearrange shmem_inode_info fields so those most likely to be needed are most

    [PATCH] ppc64: improved VSID allocation algorithm
    
    This patch has been tested both on SLB and segment table machines.  This
    new approach is far from the final word in VSID/context allocation, but
    it's a noticeable improvement on the old method.
    
    Replace the VSID allocation algorithm.  The new algorithm first generates a
    36-bit "proto-VSID" (with 0xfffffffff reserved).  For kernel addresses this
    is equal to the ESID (address >> 28), for user addresses it is:
    
    	(context << 15) | (esid & 0x7fff)
    
    These are distinguishable from kernel proto-VSIDs because the top bit is
    clear.  Proto-VSIDs with the top two bits equal to 0b10 are reserved for
    now.
    
    The proto-VSIDs are then scrambled into real VSIDs with the multiplicative
    hash:
    
    	VSID = (proto-VSID * VSID_MULTIPLIER) % VSID_MODULUS
    	where	VSID_MULTIPLIER = 268435399 = 0xFFFFFC7
    		VSID_MODULUS = 2^36-1 = 0xFFFFFFFFF
    
    This scramble is 1:1, because VSID_MULTIPLIER and VSID_MODULUS are co-prime
    since VSID_MULTIPLIER is prime (the largest 28-bit prime, in fact).
    
    This scheme has a number of advantages over the old one:
    
    - We now have VSIDs for every kernel address (i.e.  everything above
      0xC000000000000000), except the very top segment.  That simplifies a
      number of things.
    
    - We allow for 15 significant bits of ESID for user addresses with 20
      bits of context.  i.e.  8T (43 bits) of address space for up to 1M
      contexts, significantly more than the old method (although we will need
      changes in the hash path and context allocation to take advantage of
      this).
    
    - Because we use a real multiplicative hash function, we have better and
      more robust hash scattering with this VSID algorithm (at least based on
      some initial results).
    
    Because the MODULUS is 2^n-1 we can use a trick to compute it efficiently
    without a divide or extra multiply.  This makes the new algorithm barely
    slower than the old one.

      other out of birecs. Luckily we could find no user of the command

    [PATCH] ppc64: lparcfg fixes for processor counts
    
    This patch corrects how the lparcfg interface was presenting the number of
    active and potential processors.  (As reported in LTC bugzilla number 10889).
    
    - Correct output for partition_potential_processors and
      system_active_processors.
    - suppress pool related values in scenarios where they do not make
      sense. (non-shared processor configurations)
    - Display pool_capacity as a percentage, to match the behavior from
      iSeries code.

    [PATCH] ES7000 subarch update
    
    The patch below implements an algorithm to determine an unique GSI override
    for mapping GSIs to IO-APIC pins correctly.  GSI overrides are required in
    order for ES7000 machines to function properly since IRQ to pin mappings
    are NOT all one-to-one.  This patch applies only to the Unisys specific
    ES7000 machines and has been tested thoroughly on several models of the
    ES7000 line.

    [ARM] Convert suspend to a state machine.
    
    The original version had issues when two suspend events came
    in at around the same time, causing APM to get confused:
    threads became stuck in APM_IOC_SUSPEND and suspends_pending
    incremented on each apm --suspend call.
    
    Now, we only add a suspend event to a users queue and increment
    suspends_pending if the user isn't already in the middle of
    handling a suspend event.

    Thanks to David for his help in tracking it down.
    
      compile the kernel with sibling call optimization
      turned off. There is a problem with all functions
      using the optimization and the asmlinkage attribute.
      The compiler should not perform the optimization on
      these functions because it cannot preserve the syscall
      parameters in the callee. This caused SIGSEGV on programs
      traced with PTRACE_SYSCALL, for instance.

    [NET] generalise per protocol slab cache handling
    
    With this patch we get two new slabcaches, for sctp socks, that previously
    were being allocated on the default, that was tcp[6]_sock, i.e. wasting 288
    bytes per sock in the IPv4 case and 256 bytes for the IPv6 version, this is in
    preparation for DCCP (or any other new protocol :) ).
    
    With this in place another nice side effect that is easier to achieve is to
    get rid of struct sock sk->sk_slab, and instead use sk->sk_prot->slab, saving
    sizeof(void *) on every struct sock instance, but this unfortunatly has to
    wait for the conversion of all protocols that use per socket slabcaches to
    use sk->sk_prot, AF_UNIX is the only one AFAIK, so I'll try to convert it to
    use sk->sk_prot and then get rid of sk->sk_slab.
    
    As for the protocols that don't use per socket slabcaches its just a matter
    of defaulting to sk_cachep at sk_free time if sk->sk_prot is NULL.

    [PATCH] linux/dma-mapping.h needs linux/device.h
    
    It seems that most architectures already include linux/device.h in their
    own asm/dma-mapping.h.  Most but not all, and some drivers fail to
    compile on those architectures that don't.  Since everybody needs it
    let's include device.h from one place only and fix compilation for
    everybody.

    [PATCH] Backward compatibility for compat sched_getaffinity
    
    The follow patch special cases the NR_CPUS <= BITS_PER_COMPAT_LONG case.
    Without this patch, a 32bit task would be required to have a 64bit
    cpumask no matter what value of NR_CPUS are used.
    
    With this patch a compat long sized bitmask is allowed if NR_CPUS is
    small enough to fit within it.
    
    Of course applications should be using the glibc wrappers that use an
    opaque cpu_mask_t type, but there could be older applications using the
    syscalls directly.

    [PATCH] Clean up compat sched affinity syscalls
    
    Remove the set_fs hack in the compat affinity calls. Create
    sched_getaffinity and sched_setaffinity helper functions that both the
    native and compat affinity syscalls use.
    
    Also make the compat functions match what the native ones are doing now,
    setaffinity calls succeed no matter what length the bitmask is, but
    getaffinity calls must pass in bitmasks at least as long as the kernel
    type.

    [IPV6]: Add option to copy DSCP in decap in ip6_tunnel.
    
    Here is a patch that allows the copying of the DSCP during decapsulation
    for ip6_tunnel.  I've made it a separate option from the one that
    determines the copying during encapsulation since the DSCP processing
    may be asymmetric.  It also means that we preserve compatibility should
    anyone be relying on the current behaviour.
    
    inet_ecn.h might appear to be an odd place for ipv6_copy_dscp, but
    I couldn't put it in dsfield.h since I want to use ipv6_get_dsfield
    in inet_ecn.h later on.  The other alternative would be to define
    INET_ECN_MASK in dsfield.h.

    /proc/net/ip_conntrack was changed over to seq_file.  However,
    seq_file isn't a great fit (a linked list which is changing is not a
    good candidate for seq file), and the conversion was done badly.

    Well, rt->rt6i_idev is always set if it is dynamically allocated.
    However, when we hit ip6_null_entry here, its rt6i_idev is NULL.
    This patch is minimum fix to avoid the oops for now.

    [PATCH] ide: sis5513 fix for SiS962 chipset
    
    From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>
    
    1. If the fake 5513 id bit is not set by the BIOS we must have the 5518
    id in the device table.
    
    2. If the register remapping is not set by the BIOS then the enable bit
    check in ide_pci_setup_ports will fail. It's safe to switch to the
    remapping mode here. Keeping the not remapped mode would need quite big
    changes AFAICS.
    
    Forward ported to 2.6 by me.

    Annotate pc300 wan driver PCI memory accesses.
    
    This driver caused a _lot_ of warnings due to tons
    of explicit casts to "uclong". Making all the types
    sane not only removed the warnings, but got rid of
    a lot of silly casting, since the types are now much
    more natural to what the driver wanted to do in the
    first place.

    It left TF set in the sigcontext on the stack, so a PTRACE_CONT after

    Add sparse "__iomem" infrastructure to check PCI address usage
    
    There's tons of mis-use of PCI memory-mapped IO that is used
    as if it was regular memory. That fails disastrously on a number
    of architectures, and it doesn't help that it just happens to
    work on regular x86 boxes.
    
    This makes makes us do much stricter type-checking. Some of it
    visible to the regular compiler, but the bulk of it is for sparse.

    [TCP]: Fix packet counting during retransmission.
    
    We run into a potential problem if we are doing
    TSO and we reduce the congestion window.  We might
    create a case where the TSO packet is what we need
    to resend but the congestion window is not large
    enough to allow it through.
    
    The fix is very simple, since tcp_retransmit_skb()
    is going to chop the size of the packet down to size
    of the normal non-TSO MSS, we can pretend at the top
    level that each SKB is composed of only one real MSS
    worth of data.

    [IPV6]: Deprecate all-on-link assumption
    
    If we don't have IPv6 default routes, we assume all ipv6 destinations
    are on-link as specified in RFC2461. It, however, is considered harmful now;
    it is problematic with IPv6-capable nodes that do not have off-link
    IPv6 connectivity (eg no default routers) and such nodes will take
    a few seconds until they fall back to use IPv4.
    
    See <draft-ietf-v6ops-onlinkassumption-02.txt> for details.

    [IPCOMP]: Use per-cpu buffers for compression/decompression.
    
    Here is a really ugly patch to get IPCOMP to use per-cpu buffers.  But
    I'm afraid it really is necessary.  At 300K per SA IPCOMP isn't very
    affordable at all.
    
    With per-cpu buffers this goes down to 300K per CPU.
    
    I've also turned the kmalloc'ed scratch space into a vmalloc'ed one
    since people may be loading the ipcomp module after the system has
    been running for a while.  On an i386 machine with 64M of RAM or less
    this can often cause a 64K kmalloc to fail.
    
    The crypto deflate buffer space are vmalloc'ed already as well.
    
    Part of the ugliness comes from the lazy allocation.  However we need
    the lazy initialisation since new IPCOMP algorithms may be introduced
    in future.  That means we can't allocate space for every single IPCOMP
    algorithm at module-load time.

    [IPSEC]: Find larval SAs by sequence number
    
    When larval states are generated along with ACQUIRE messages, we should
    use the sequence to find the corresponding larval state when creating
    states with ADD_SA or ALLOC_SPI.
    
    If we don't do that, then it may take down an unrelated larval state
    with the same parameters (think different TCP sessions).  This not only
    leaves behind a larval state that shouldn't be there, it may also cause
    another ACQUIRE message to be sent unnecessarily.

    [PATCH] ppc/ppc64: fix offb
    
    The recent fbdev changes broke something quite fundamental on ppc, which
    is the way offb works. It's a "fallback" driver that is to be used when
    no other driver picked up the video, or when "forced" via the video=ofonly
    command line option.
    
    The recent changes completely broke that (which is a pretty important
    behaviour on ppc since we still have some models regulary with video
    cards that don't work properly with the kernel drivers, like some nVidias
    or some older stuffs).
    
    This patch moves offb to the end of the Makefile, so at least the behaviour
    of taking over as a "fallback" is restored (the current kernel will have
    offb take control of the framebuffer before any fbdev has a chance to do
    it, which breaks everything).
    
    Apparently, the entire support for "video=ofonly" was removed though,
    that NEEDS to be restored in some way, though i'm not yet sure what is
    the best path to that yet, I have to look more deeply at the new code.

    [IA64] discontig.c: fixup pxm_to_nid_map
    
    I'd like to be able to use pxm_to_nid_map in several places to

    doesn't necessarily reflect reality.  This fixes up the table so it's
    still valid.  Note that nid_to_pxm_map is still potentially broken, but
    has a one-to-many problem if the above function combines several
    proximity domains into a single node.  Thanks to Bob Picco for the base

    This patch is needed to correctly support the new sysfs rom file.  On sn2, we
    only allocate PIO space for display option ROMs since PIO space is a
    relatively scarce resource (we've seen exhaustion when running with several
    qla cards in the same domain).  And without this patch we won't zero out
    non-display ROM resources which can lead to panics if anyone tries to use the
    bogus addresses left over there from the generic PCI probing code.

    [PATCH] affs endianness annotations
    
    AFFS partially annotated - some fields of on-disk structures are never
    used and while I'm reasonably sure that they ought to be big-endian, I'd
    rather leave them alone for now; annotating them won't change the amount
    of noise since nothing in the kernel ever accesses them.

    [NET]: NETIF_F_LLTX for devices
    
    New version of the NETIF_F_LLTX for network devices patch.
    
    This allows network drivers to set the NETIF_F_LLTX flag
    and then do their own locking in start_queue_xmit.
    This lowers locking overhead in this critical path.
    
    The drivers can use try lock if they want and return -1
    when the lock wasn't grabbed. In this case the packet
    will be requeued. For better compatibility this is only
    done for drivers with LLTX set, others don't give a special
    meaning to -1.
    
    Most of the modern drivers who have a lock around hard_start_xmit
    can just set this flag. It may be a good idea to convert the spin
    lock there to a try lock. The only thing that should be audited
    is that they do enough locking in the set_multicast_list function
    too, and not also rely on xmit_lock here.
    
    Now doesn't move any code around and does things with gotos instead.
    
    The loop printk is also still there even for NETIF_F_LLTX
    
    For drivers that don't set the new flag nothing changes.

    [IPV4/IPV6]: More fragment handling improvements.
    
    Here's the optimization: if we know the remaining data exceeds the
    mtu, we do not need to fill up full of it.
    
    skb_prev:
                    mtu
    +----------+--+-+
    |          |  | |
    +----------+--+-+
               ^  ^
    skb_prev->len |
                  maxfraglen
    
    appending data:
               +--------+
               |        |
               +--------+
               --------->
                      length
    
    In this case, we know we need more fragment(s).
    So, let's fill up to maxfraglen (instead of mtu)
    to avoid needless copy in the next loop.

    [PATCH] uml: avoid using elv_queue_empty
    
    Avoid using, in the UBD driver, the elv_queue_empty function.  It's for the
    block layer only; in fact, the Anticipatory Scheduler can return NULL with
    elv_next_request() even if the queue is not empty, because it waits for the
    process to send another request before seeking on the disk.
    
    In fact, if (with uml-ubd-any-elevator) we let UBD use any scheduler,
    elevator=as will make the UBD driver Oops, if we don't have this patch.

    [PATCH] Speed up oprofile buffer drain code
    
    I noticed a large machine was doing about 400,000 context switches per
    second when oprofile was enabled.  Upon closer inspection it looks like we
    were rearming the buffer sync timer without modifying the expire time.
    
    Now that we have schedule_delayed_work_on I believe we can remove the timer
    completely.  Each cpu should be offset by 1 jiffy so they dont all fire at
    the same time.  I bumped DEFAULT_TIMER_EXPIRE from 2 to 10 times a second
    to be sure we reap cpu buffers.
    
    With the following patch the same large machine gets about 4000 context
    switches per second.

    [PATCH] AIO/DIO oops fix
    
    The problem here is, finished_one_bio() shouldn't call aio_complete() since
    no work has been done.  I have a fix for this - can you verify this ?  I am
    not really comfortable with this "tweaking".  (I am not really sure about
    IO errors like EIO etc.  - if they can lead to calling aio_complete()
    twice)
    
    Fix is to call aio_complete() ONLY if there is something to report.  Note
    the we don't update dio->result with any error codes from get_user_pages(),
    they just passed as "ret" value from do_direct_IO().

    iterate over an array of individual drivers' xxxfb_init(), then each driver
    registers its presence back to fbmem.  During console_init(),
    drivers/char/vt.c will call fb_console_init().  fbcon will check for
    registered drivers, and if any are present, will call take_over_console()
    in drivers/char/vt.c.
    
    This patch changes the initialization sequence so it proceeds in this
    manner: Each driver has its own module_init().  Each driver calls
    register_framebuffer() in fbmem.c.  fbmem.c will then notify fbcon of the
    driver registration.  Upon notification, fbcon calls take_over_console() in
    vt.c.
    
    The following are the changes brought about by this patch:
    
    - Each subsystem (fbcon, fbmem, xxxfb) will have their own module_init.
      Thus, explicit calls to each subsystem's init functions are eliminated.
    
    - The struct fb_drivers array in fbmem.c can be removed.  This slashes
      around 400 lines in fbmem.c
    
    - Parsing of kernel boot options were done by fbmem.c calling each
      driver's xxxfb_setup() function.  Because this is not possible with this
      patch, drivers can choose to either:
    
      - have their own __setup() routine
    
      - call fb_get_options("xxxfb") and pass the return value to
        xxxfb_setup().  This is to maintain compatibility with the
        'video=xxxfb:<options>' semantics.
    
    - Getting a framebuffer console will occur a bit late during the boot
      process since the initialization sequence will depend upon the link
      order.  So, 'video/' is moved up in drivers/Makefile, shortly after
      'pci/'
    
    - Because driver initialization will be dependent on the link order,
      hardware that depends on other subsystems (agpgart, usb, serial, etc) may
      choose to initialize after the subsystems they depend on.

    [PATCH] fbcon: take over console on driver registration
    
    - This fixes another regression from 2.4.  If fbcon is compiled
      statically, and the framebuffer driver is compiled as a module, doing a
      'modprobe xxxfb' does nothing to the console.  This has generated
      numerous bug reports from users.
    
      With this patch, fbmem will notify fbcon upon driver registration
      allowing fbcon to take over the console.
    
    - This also fixes con2fbmap not working if fbcon is compiled as a module
      using the same mechanism as described above.

    The following patch switches arch/ppc/boot over from using its own version
    of zlib to the code found under lib/zlib_inflate.  In conjunction with the
    previous two patches, the size of the resulting images isn't noticably
    different.  But this does have the advantage of removing another copy of
    zlib from the kernel, and I believe this allows for lib/inflate.c to go
    away (as that's basically what ppc used to use).

    [PATCH] fs/compat.c: rwsem instead of BKL around ioctl32_hash_table
    
    Currently the BKL is used to synchronize access to ioctl32_hash_table in
    fs/compat.c.  It seems that an rwsem would be more appropriate, since this
    would allow multiple lookups to occur in parallel (and also serve the
    general good of minimizing use of the BKL).
    
    I added lock_kernel()/unlock_kernel() around the call to t->handler when a
    compatibility handler is found in compat_sys_ioctl() to preserve the
    expectation that the BKL will be held during driver ioctl operations.  It
    should be safe to do lock_kernel() while holding ioctl32_sem because of the
    magic BKL sleep semantics.

    [PATCH] fix f_version optimization for get_tgid_list
    
    The kernel contains an optimization that skips the linked list walk in
    get_tgid_list for the common case of sequential accesses.  Unfortunately
    the optimization is buggy (missing NULL pointer check for the result of
    find_task_by_pid) and broken (actually - broken twice: the tgid value that
    is stored in f_version is always 0 because tgid is overwritten when the
    string is created and additionally the common case is not filldir < 0, it's

    [PATCH] make single-step into signal delivery stop in handler
    
    On x86 and x86-64, setting up to run a signal handler clears the
    single-step bit (TF) in the processor flags before starting the handler.
    This makes sense when a process is handling its own SIGTRAPs.
    
    But when TF is set because PTRACE_SINGLESTEP was used, and that call
    specified a handled signal so the handler setup is happening, it doesn't
    make so much sense.  When the debugger stops to show you a signal about to
    be delivered, and that signal should be handled, and then you do step or
    stepi, you expect to see the signal handler code.  In fact, the signal
    handler runs to completion and then you see the single-step trap at the
    resumed code instead of seeing the handler.
    
    This patch changes signal handler setup so that when TF is set and the
    thread is under ptrace control, it synthesizes a single-step trap after
    setting up the PC and registers to start the handler.  This makes that
    PTRACE_SINGLESTEP not strictly a "step", since it actually runs no user
    instructions at all.  But it is definitely what a debugger user wants, so
    that single-stepping always stops and shows each and every instruction
    before it gets executed.

    [PATCH] i386 syscall tracing of bogus system calls
    
    In 2.4, strace will show you all bogus system calls a process tries.  In

    [PATCH] Remove RUSAGE_GROUP
    
    After my cleanup of the rusage semantics was so quickly taken in by Andrew
    and Linus without comment, I wonder if I should not have tried to be so
    accommodating of potential objections as I was.  :-)
    
    In my original posting, I solicited comment on whether introducing
    RUSAGE_GROUP as distinct from RUSAGE_SELF was warranted.  Note that we've
    now changed the behavior of the times system call when using CLONE_THREAD,
    so changing getrusage RUSAGE_SELF to match would be consistent.  I think
    that changing the meaning of the old RUSAGE_SELF value is preferable to
    introducing the new value for the proper POSIX getrusage behavior.  This
    patch against Linus's current tree dumps RUSAGE_GROUP and makes RUSAGE_SELF
    have the fixed behavior.
    
    If there is interest in having a new explicit interface to sample a single
    thread's stats alone, then I think that would be better done by introducing
    a new value for RUSAGE_THREAD.  This is trivial to implement, but I won't
    offer patches bloating the interface if noone is actually interested in
    using it.

    [PATCH] ptrace userspace API preservation
    
    This makes any ptrace operation that finds the target in TASK_STOPPED state
    morph it into TASK_TRACED state before doing anything.  This necessitates
    reverting the last_siginfo accesses to check instead of assume last_siginfo
    is set, since it's no longer impossible to be in TASK_TRACED without being
    stopped in ptrace_stop (though there are no associated races to worry
    about).

    [PATCH] cleanup ptrace stops and remove notify_parent
    
    This adds a new state TASK_TRACED that is used in place of TASK_STOPPED
    when a thread stops because it is ptraced.  Now ptrace operations are only
    permitted when the target is in TASK_TRACED state, not in TASK_STOPPED.
    This means that if a process is stopped normally by a job control signal
    and then you PTRACE_ATTACH to it, you will have to send it a SIGCONT before
    you can do any ptrace operations on it.  (The SIGCONT will be reported to
    ptrace and then you can discard it instead of passing it through when you
    call PTRACE_CONT et al.)
    
    If a traced child gets orphaned while in TASK_TRACED state, it morphs into
    TASK_STOPPED state.  This makes it again possible to resume or destroy the
    process with SIGCONT or SIGKILL.
    
    All non-signal tracing stops should now be done via ptrace_notify.  I've
    updated the syscall tracing code in several architectures to do this
    instead of replicating the work by hand.  I also fixed several that were
    unnecessarily repeating some of the checks in ptrace_check_attach.  Calling
    ptrace_check_attach alone is sufficient, and the old checks repeated before
    are now incorrect, not just superfluous.
    
    I've closed a race in ptrace_check_attach.  With this, we should have a
    robust guarantee that when ptrace starts operating, the task will be in
    TASK_TRACED state and won't come out of it.  This is because the only way
    to resume from TASK_TRACED is via ptrace operations, and only the one
    parent thread attached as the tracer can do those.
    
    This patch also cleans up the do_notify_parent and do_notify_parent_cldstop
    code so that the dead and stopped cases are completely disjoint.  The
    notify_parent function is gone.

    [PATCH] factor out common <asm/hardirq.h> code
    
    Since the irq handling rework in 2.5 lots of code in the individual
    <asm/hardirq.h> files is the same.  This patch moves that common code
    to <linux/hardirq.h>.  The following differences existed:
    
     - alpha, m68k, m68knommu and v850 were missing the ~PREEMPT_ACTIVE
       masking in the CONFIG_PREEMPT case of in_atomic().  These
       architectures don't support CONFIG_PREEMPT else this would have been
       an easily-spottbale bug
     - S390 didn't provide synchronize_irq as it doesn't fit into their
       I/O model.  They now get a spurious prototype/macro
     - ppc added a new preemptible() macro that is provided for all
       architectures now.
    
    Most drivers were using <linux/interrupt.h> as they should, but a few
    drivers and lots of architecture code has been updated to use
    <linux/hardirq.h> instead of <asm/hardirq.h>

    [PATCH] Cleanup & fix lost ticks handling on x86-64
    
    This cleans up the x86-64 lost tick handling and fixes some issues:
    
    First it moves that code into an own function.
    
    The newer could would become very noisy when the machine loses timer ticks
    regularly.  This happens often on some laptops etc.  during the acpi ec
    access (nothing much can be really done about it) This patch prints the
    warnings only once.
    
    It also fixes the logic on when to ask cpufreq for a new estimate.
    
    And it implements timer fallback to HPET when there are really lots of lost
    ticks.  This is following i386.  PIT fallback isn't implemented right now
    though, but I hope we don't need this.

    [PATCH] ppc64: handle SLB misses in realmode
    
    Tested on pSeries and iSeries.  Some future plans for VSID allocation may
    mean we have to take this out again, but that's a while off yet, and in the
    meantime it's a significant speedup.
    
    This patch makes the PPC64 SLB miss handler run in real mode (i.e.  MMU
    off) for it's whole duration, on pSeries machines.  Avoiding the rfid used
    to turn relocation on saves some 70-80 cycles on Power4 and Power5.  Not
    having to save and restore SRR0 and SRR1 saves a few more, and means we
    don't need an extra save slot for r3.  Overall there's around a 27% speedup
    on Power4.

    [PATCH] Time interpolator: Scalability enhancements and high resolution time for IA64
    
    This has been in the ia64 (and hence -mm) trees for a couple of months.
    
    Changelog:
     * Affects only architectures which define CONFIG_TIME_INTERPOLATION
       (currently only IA64)
     * Genericize time interpolation, make time interpolators easily usable
       and provide instructions on how to use the interpolator for other
       architectures.
     * Provide nanosecond resolution for clock_gettime and an accuracy
       up to the time interpolator time base.
     * clock_getres() reports resolution of underlying time basis which
       is typically <50ns and may be 1ns on some systems.
     * Make time interpolator self-tuning to limit time jumps
       and to make the interpolators work correctly on systems with
       broken time base specifications.
     * SMP scalability: Make clock_gettime and gettimeofday scale O(1)
       by removing the cmpxchg for most clocks (tested for up to 512 CPUs)
     * IA64: provide asm fastcall that doubles the performance
       of gettimeofday and clock_gettime on SGI and other IA64 systems
       (asm fastcalls scale O(1) together with the scalability fixes).

    [PATCH] input: Fix hiddev disconnect-while-in-use oops
    
    hid-core calls hiddev_disconnect() when the underlying device goes away
    (hot unplug or system shutdown).  Normally, hiddev_disconnect() will clean
    up nicely and return to hid-core who then frees the hid structure.
    However, if the corresponding hiddev node is open at disconnect time,
    hiddev delays the majority of disconnect work until the device is closed
    via hiddev_release().  hiddev_release() calls hiddev_cleanup() which
    proceeds to dereference the hid struct which hid-core freed back when the
    hardware was disconnected.  Oops.
    
    To solve this, we change hiddev_disconnect() to deregister the hiddev minor
    and invalidate its table entry immediately and delay only the freeing of
    the hiddev structure itself.  We're protected against future operations on
    the fd since the major fops check hiddev->exists.

    [PATCH] SN2 build fix CONFIG_VIRTUAL_MEM_MAP and CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM
    
    The change on 2004-09-03 by ianw@gelato.unsw.edu.au appears to have
    a typo, which causes builds of configurations which define both
    CONFIG_VIRTUAL_MEM_MAP and CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM to emit some 890
    warnings for redefines of each of pfn_valid, page_to_pfn,
    pfn_to_page.
    
    This shows up compiling sn2_defconfig, the SN2 config of arch ia64.  I
    believe that this is a simply typo, an extra "#else" line.  Removing
    this exta line enables sn2_defconfig to build as before.

    ip_ct_log_invalid was added without testing that it compiles without

    [NET]: Fix compat layer setsockopt overzealous conversions.
    
    compat_sys_setsockopt() is a little overzealous about converting 32-bit
    stuff into 64-bit. It should match on level _and_ optname, not just
    optname. Currently it eats the IPV6_V6ONLY sockopt because its value
    (26) happens to match SO_ATTACH_FILTER.
    
    This makes it at least check 'level' for everything but
    IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE == IPT6_SO_SET_REPLACE, because that does seem to be
    the same in different levels. But do_netfilter_replace() is another can
    of worms entirely -- it doesn't actually work either, because some
    netfilter modules (like ipt_limit) include kernel-only bits which change
    size in the structure they share with userspace.

    [NET]: Fully plug netigh_create/inetdev_destroy race.
    
    So here is a patch to make sure that there is a barrier between the
    reading of dev->*_ptr and *dev->neigh_parms.
    
    With these barriers in place, it's clear that *dev->neigh_parms can no
    longer be NULL since once the parms are allocated, that pointer is never
    reset to NULL again.  Therefore I've also removed the parms check in
    these paths.
    
    They were bogus to begin with since if they ever triggered then we'll
    have dead neigh entries stuck in the hash table.
    
    Unfortunately I couldn't arrange for this to happen with DECnet due
    to the dn_db->parms.up() call that's sandwiched between the assignment
    of dev->dn_ptr and dn_db->neigh_parms.  So I've kept the parms check
    there but it will now fail instead of continuing.  I've also added an
    smp_wmb() there so that at least we won't be reading garbage from
    dn_db->neigh_parms.
    
    DECnet is also buggy since there is no locking at all in the destruction
    path.  It either needs locking or RCU like IPv4.

    [TCP]: Make TSO play nice with congestion window.
    
    Previously TSO would not abide by the congestion
    window properly.  Essentially, each TSO packet would
    be trated just like 1 normal packet, even though a TSO
    packet generates more than 1 normal packet.  This
    violates congestion window rules entirely.
    
    So now we record the TSO factor, a count of how many
    real packets a TSO packet will generate, and include
    this in all the packet counting routines.
    
    This initial version has a bug in that skb_entail() is
    not the correct time to figure out the TSO factor for
    the SKB, and tp->mss_tso_factor is not necessarily the
    right value for a given SKB.  Will fix this up next.

    kbuild: Simplify generating vmlinux
    
    Generating vmlinux in top-level Makefile were getting a bit messy after kallsyms
    support were added. Also the full link of all the .o files were duplicaed a number of times.
    This patch does the following:
    - Introduce built-in.o which is a prelink of most .o files
    - Make the build process a bit more verbose telling when linking .tmpvmlinux*
    - Use less magic when determing when to generate a new version
    - Allow architectures to override the defineition of cmd_vmlinux__
    - Add more comments to the MAkefile and clean up soem other comments
    - Display more commends during V=1 builds
    
    The resulting kernel boots and rn here.

    kbuild: Support LOCALVERSION
    
    Add LOCALVERSION so we can append strings that show up in uname
    without having to fiddle with the Makefile and EXTRAVERSION, etc.
    
    * localversion* files are read first
    * config variable is appended last
    * LOCALVERSION from the command line overrides all of this
    * check is forced on build, since we can't really know when
      the config or environment options change.

    Patch from Ben Dooks
    
    Include the central code for detecting the cpu in use,
    and initialising it's IO. Updated all mach-XXX.c files to
    use this new init.
    
    Added the first stage of the new serial port code by
    calling s3c2410_init_uarts() instead of just setting
    a variable.
    
    Updates mach-h1940.c to prefix with h1940_ instead of ipaq_

    Patch from Dave Jiang
    
    This patch depends on the applied patches of 1963/1 2017/1
    This is the arch/arm/boot directory
    
    As to address RMK's previous questions in head-xscale.S, all that are workarounds
    for improper things coming from redboot. Currently the distribution redboot for IOP does not pass in correct MACH ID or setup the memory map correctly after exec (according to Deepak). So we have to fix it. I'm working on pushing the IOP redboot developer to fix those things at a later date.

    [PATCH] out-of-line locks / generic
    
    This patch achieves out of line spinlocks by creating kernel/spinlock.c
    and using the _raw_* inline locking functions.
    
    Now, as much as this is supposed to be arch agnostic, there was still a
    fair amount of rummaging about in archs, mostly for the cases where the
    arch already has out of line locks and i wanted to avoid the extra call,
    saving that extra call also makes lock profiling easier.  PPC32/64 was
    an example of such an arch and i have added the necessary profile_pc()
    function as an example.
    
    Size differences are with CONFIG_PREEMPT enabled since we wanted to
    determine how much could be saved by moving that lot out of line too.

    [PATCH] fix media detection for nForce 2 nics
    
    attached is a patch that polls the media setting for non GigE nForce
    nics:
    Without polling, media changes are not autodetected. This is fatal,
    because the nic initialization is asynchroneous, thus "modprobe;ifup"
    resulted in a dead network connection. The attached patch fixes that
    problem.
    
    It's a repost of a patch I sent around three weeks ago: you objected
    that I rely on the nic irq instead of a software timer. I've documented
    why this is ok.

    [PATCH] fix sched_domains hotplug bootstrap ordering vs. cpu_online_map issue
    
    cpu_online_map is not set up at the time of sched domain initialization
    when hotplug cpu paths are used for SMP booting.
    
    At this phase of bootstrapping, cpu_possible_map can be used by the
    various architectures using cpu hotplugging for SMP bootstrap, but the
    manipulations of cpu_online_map done on behalf of NUMA architectures,
    done indirectly via node_to_cpumask(), can't, because cpu_online_map
    starts depopulated and hasn't yet been populated.
    
    On true NUMA architectures this is a distinct cpumask_t from
    cpu_online_map and so the unpatched code works on NUMA; on non-NUMA
    architectures the definition of node_to_cpumask() this way breaks and
    would require an invasive sweeping of users of node_to_cpumask() to
    change it to e.g.  cpu_possible_map, as cpu_possible_map is not suitable
    for use at runtime as a substitute for cpu_online_map.

    [PATCH] Sort the CREDITS file properly (and add Jesper)
    
    Many entries in the CREDITS file are not properly sorted in alphabetical
    order, despite the note in the file that it is supposed to be sorted like
    that.
    
    This patch attempts to sort the CREDITS file properly.  No existing entries
    were changed, merely moved around in the file.  There where a few tricky
    names that I was unsure how to sort (names with characters such as ü, ö,
    and people with many names where it was unclear to me what name to sort by
    etc), in those cases I've usually left the names where they were unless it
    was glaringly obvious they were in the wrong spot.
    
    I've also taken the liberty to add my own name to the file - I have
    contributed several tiny/small fixes/cleanups etc over the years.

    [PATCH] announce hpet devices claimed
    
    I think the HPET driver should announce the hardware it claims.  Here's
    a patch that prints this:
    
    	hpet0: at MMIO 0xc0000ffffc002000, IRQs 74, 75, 76
    	hpet0: 4ns tick, 3 64-bit timers
    	hpet1: at MMIO 0xc0000ffffc082000, IRQs 77, 78, 79
    	hpet1: 4ns tick, 3 64-bit timers
    
    This has been acked by Bob.  I haven't heard from Venkatesh.
    
    Print basic information (MMIO address, IRQs used, tick rate, number
    of timers) when claiming an HPET device.

    Since in-kernel colorspace conversion is not allowed, this patch disables it

    in case they don't work without conversion reenabled by setting the new

    [PATCH] fix the barrier IDE detection logic
    
    This fixes the logic so we always check for the cache.  It also defaults to
    safer behaviour for the non cache flush case now we have the right bits in
    the right places.  I've also played a bit with timings - the worst case
    timings I can get for the flush are about 7 seconds (which I'd expect as
    the engineering worst cases will include retries)
    
    Probably what should happen is that the barrier logic is enabled providing
    the wcache is disabled.  I've not meddled with this as I don't know what
    the intended semantics and rules are for disabling barrier on a live disk
    (eg when a user uses hdparm to turn on the write cache).  In the current
    code as with Jens original that cannot occur.
    
    I've also fixed the new printk's as per a private request from Matt Domsch.

    [PATCH] Root reservations for strict overcommit
    
    This was on my TODO list for a while and it turns out someone already fixed
    the armwaving overcommit mode for the same problem.  It is easy to get into
    a situation where you have no overcommit and nothing can be done because
    there is no memory to clean up the stable but non-useful state of the
    machine.
    
    The fix is trivial and duplicated from the armwaving overcommit code path.
    The last 3% of the memory can be claimed by root processes only.  It isn't
    a cure but it does seem to solve the real world problems - at least
    providing you have enough memory for 3% to be useful 8).

    [PATCH] Add IXDP2x01 board support to CS89x0 driver
    
    The following patch modifies the CS89x0 driver to work on Intel's IXDP2401
    and IXDP2801 (Intel ARm/XScale based) platforms:
    
    - The main change requried is that the IXDP2x01 boards have the
      chip connected through a CPLD so all registers appear at
      dword-aligned addresses. A macro in the header adjusts the register
      offsets appropriately.
    
    - The boards do not have ISA, so we need to explicitly check for
      IXDP2X01 in Kconfig.
    
    - There is what I believe is a bug in the driver as it currently
      only asks for the signature if ioaddr & 1 is set but then
      reads and checks against the expected signature even when
      !(ioaddr & 1). This causes the driver to not load on the IXDP2x01
      since our ioaddr does not have bit 1 set.
    
    - #ifdef out some bits of code that assume the chip is really
      sitting on an ISA bus.
    
    The main IXDP2x01 support will be coming in through rmk's tree at
    a later date when all the drivers are merged upstream.

    [PATCH] Fix argument checking in sched_setaffinity
    
    This patch fixes the argument length checking in sched_setaffinity.
    
    Previously it would error out when the length passed was smaller than
    sizeof(cpumask_t).  And any bits beyond cpumask_s would be silently
    ignored.
    
    First this assumes that the user application knows the size of cpumask_t,
    which should be kernel internal.  When you increase cpumask_t old
    applications break and there is no good way for the application to find out
    the cpumask_t size the kernel uses.
    
    This patch changes it to do similar checking to the NUMA API calls:
    
    - Any length is ok as long as all online CPUs are covered (this could
      still cause application breakage with more CPUs, but there is no good way
      around it)
    
    - When the user passes more than cpumask_t bytes the excess bytes are
      checked to be zero.

    Without this the kernel's node discovery would assign the wrong nodes on

    Only handles power of two cored CPUs, others will be ignored.

    show the other core as HT sibling (this is needed to make old CPU based
    license managers to count one CPU package as only one physical CPU)

    [PATCH] ppc64: allocate NUMA node data node locally
    
    Instead of statically allocating the NUMA node structures, do it at runtime
    with node local memory where possible.  With NR_CPUS=128 we had over 800kB
    of memory allocated before this patch, now we allocate only as many nodes
    as the machine requires.
    
    We have to do some fancy footwork in do_init_bootmem since we use both the
    LMB allocator and the bootmem allocator at the same time.  The problem has
    always been there although I only recently found a test case that hit it.
    Wrap that logic in careful_allocation which uses the LMB allocator then
    falls back to the bootmem allocator if required.
    
    Now alloc_bootmem on a node with no memory doesnt panic, we dont need the
    hack in paging_init so remove it.

    [PATCH] ppc64: quieten NUMA boot messages
    
    On some machines we would print hundreds of lines of NUMA debug output.
    The following patch cleans it up so we only print a summary of cpus and
    memory vs nodes:
    
    Node 0 CPUs: 0-1
    Node 1 CPUs: 16-17
    Node 2 CPUs: 32-33
    Node 3 CPUs: 48-49
    Node 0 Memory: 0x0-0x400000000
    Node 1 Memory: 0x400000000-0x800000000
    
    I lifted the code to do this out of xmon.

    [PATCH] ppc64: topdown support
    
    Recent patches introduced a top down user process address space allocation
    policy; further patches enable this for ppc64.  Although these work
    correctly for normal maps, the topdown algorithm does not take into account
    stringent mixing constraints for small and large pages on this
    architecture.  These patches introduce a ppc64 specific
    arch_get_unused_area_topdown() variant.  The first introduces
    infrastructure to allow replacement of the generic
    arch_get_unused_area_topdown() and the second utilises this infrastructure.
    
    In this patch I have followed the pattern set by the arch_get_unused_area()
    using HAVE_ARCH_UNMAPPED_AREA_TOPDOWN to be consistent.  However, it would
    also be possible to simply have a ppc64_get_unused_area_topdown() in the
    arch/ppc64/mm/mmap.c or to use weak bindings.
    
    This patch:
    
    Allow an architecture to override the default definition of
    arch_get_unmapped_area_topdown().

    [PATCH] ppc64: pin the kernel stack's SLB entry
    
    This has been given basic testing on Power4 pSeries and iSeries machines.
    
    At present, the SLB miss handler has to check the SLB slot it is about to
    use to ensure that it does not contain the SLBE for the current kernel
    stack - throwing out the SLBE for the kernel stack can trigger the
    "megabug": we have no SLBE for the stack, but we don't fault immediately
    because we have an ERAT entry for it.  The ERAT entry is then lost due to a
    tlbie on another CPU during the unrecoverable section of the exception
    return path.
    
    This patch implements a different approach - with this patch SLB slot 2
    always (well, nearly always) contains an SLBE for the stack.  This slot is
    never cast out by the normal SLB miss path.  On context switch, an SLBE for
    the new stack is pinned into this slot, unless the new stack is the the
    bolted segment.
    
    For iSeries we need a special workaround because there is no way of
    ensuring the stack SLBE is preserved an a shared processor switch.  So, we
    still need to handle taking an SLB miss on the stack, in which case we must
    make sure it is loaded into slot 2, rather than using the normal
    round-robin.
    
    This approach shaves a few ns off the slb miss time (on pSeries), but more
    importantly makes it easier to experiment with different SLB castout
    aporoaches without worrying about reinstating the megabug.

    [PATCH] ppc[64]: increase max auxv entries
    
     ... but a better solution should probably be found, that's saved_auxv
    in struct mm_struct is ... hrm... disgusting at least ;)
    
    So the problem is that we currently do
    
    	unsigned long saved_auxv[40];
    
    That is we assume that all archs will have an AUXV entry of no more than
    2 unsigned longs and we'll have no more than 20 entries in the table.
    
    Unfortunately, this is wrong.
    
    PPC/PPC64 adds 5 platform entries. then we add 14 in the common code,
    and then we have
    
    	if (k_platform) {
    		NEW_AUX_ENT(AT_PLATFORM, (elf_addr_t)(unsigned long)u_platform);
    	}
    	if (bprm->interp_flags & BINPRM_FLAGS_EXECFD) {
    		NEW_AUX_ENT(AT_EXECFD, (elf_addr_t) bprm->interp_data);
    	}
    
    which may add a 20th entry... which means we are already out of room for
    the terminating AT_NULL entry... bad bad bad.
    
    Now I'm adding AT_SYSINFO_EHDR to ppc/ppc64 and it breaks all the time.
    
    The quick fix is to bump the number of entries in struct mm_struct to 42,
    though that's worth a big BOLD comment in binfmt_elf in case anybody adds
    a new entry in there. (Patch below). I wonder if we shouldn't add a
    ARCH_MAX_AUXV_ENTRIES macro to the asm-arch/elf.h though to get the max
    amount of entry the arch may add to the normal count, and have the mm
    struct array use that plus the number of "normal" entries...
    
    This patch increase the max amount of auxv entries in struct mm_struct to
    42 so that ppc & ppc64 don't get a chance to blow the array up.

    [PATCH] fix target_cpus() for summit subarch
    
    I've been hunting down a bug affecting IBM x440/x445 systems where the
    floppy driver would get spurious interrupts and would not initialize
    properly.
    
    After digging James Cleverdon and Bill Irwin pointed out that target_cpus()
    is routing the interrupts to the clustered apic broadcast mask using
    destFixed deliver mode.  This was causing multiple interrupts to show up,
    breaking the floppy init code.
    
    This fix simply changes the delivery mode to dest_LowestPrio and initially
    routes interrupts to the first cpu to resolve this issue.

    [NET]: Add reference counting to neigh_parms.
    
    I've added a refcnt on neigh_parms as well as a dead flag.  The latter
    is checked under the tbl_lock before adding a neigh entry to the hash
    table.
    
    The non-trivial bit of the patch is the first chunk of net/core/neighbour.c.
    I removed that line because not doing so would mean that I have to drop
    the reference to the parms right there.  That would've lead to race
    conditions since many places dereference neigh->parms without holding
    locks.  It's also unnecessary to reset n->parms since we're no longer
    in a hurry to see it go due to the new ref counting.
    
    You'll also notice that I've put all dereferences of dev->*_ptr under
    the rcu_read_lock().  Without this we may get a neigh_parms that's
    already been released.
    
    Incidentally a lot of these places were racy even before the RCU change.
    For example, in the IPv6 case neigh->parms may be set to a value that's
    just been released.
    
    Finally in order to make sure that all stale entries are purged as
    quickly as possible I've added neigh_ifdown/arp_ifdown calls after
    every neigh_parms_release call.  In many cases we now have multiple
    calls to neigh_ifdown in the shutdown path.  I didn't remove the
    earlier calls because there may be hidden dependencies for them to
    be there.  Once the respective maintainers have looked at them we
    can probably remove most of them.

    [NETFILTER]: Fix deadlock condition in conntrack/nat-helpers
    
    There is a possible deadlock condition with conntrack/nat-helpers:
    
    CPU1:
    conntrack-helper:help: lock(private_lock)
    ip_conntrack_expect_related: write_lock(ip_conntrack_lock)
    
    CPU2:
    nat-core:do_bindings: read_lock(ip_conntrack_lock)
    nat-helper:help: lock(private_lock)
    
    The lock in the nat-helper is unneccessary because the expectation
    is never changed and is protected by ip_conntrack_lock.

    Thanks to Davem for noticing. We probably should _not_ trust the

    [PATCH] fixed pidhashing patch
    
    This patch fixes strange and obscure pid implementation in current kernels:
    - it removes calling of put_task_struct() from detach_pid()
      under tasklist_lock. This allows to use blocking calls
      in security_task_free() hooks (in __put_task_struct()).
    - it saves some space = 5*5 ints = 100 bytes in task_struct
    - it's smaller and tidy, more straigthforward and doesn't use
      any knowledge about pids using and assignment.
    - it removes pid_links and pid_struct doesn't hold reference counters
      on task_struct. instead, new pid_structs and linked altogether and
      only one of them is inserted in hash_list.

    [IPV4/IPV6]: Fix suboptimal fragment sizing for last fragment
    
    Yoshifuji's recent fragment patch prevents unnecessary fragmentation
    when the data can be kept in a single packet, but only for the first
    packet. When fragmenting, all fragments are still truncated to
    multiples of 8 and we might end up creating an unnecessary fragment.
    
    This dump shows the problem (MTU 1499):
    
    172.16.1.123.32771 > 172.16.195.3.4135: udp 2937 (frag 7066:1472@0+)
    172.16.1.123 > 172.16.195.3: udp (frag 7066:1472@1472+)
    172.16.1.123 > 172.16.195.3: udp (frag 7066:1@2944)
    
    This patch always builds mtu sized fragments and truncates the previous
    fragment to a multiple of 8 bytes when allocating a new one. With the
    patch the dump looks like this:
    
    
    172.16.1.123.32772 > 172.16.195.3.4135: udp 2937 (frag 49641:1472@0+)
    172.16.1.123 > 172.16.195.3: udp (frag 49641:1473@1472)

    kbuild: Set cflags before including arch Makefile
    
    Please note that this patch, even if UML-related, should be immediately
    discussed for merging in mainline, if possible. The UML patch to handle
    this has therefore been separated.
    
    Patch purpose:
    If arch/$(ARCH)/Makefile is included before adding -O2 (and the rest) to
    CFLAGS, I must duplicate the addition of it to USER_CFLAGS for UML.
    So let's fix this.

    [ARM] IXP2000 cleanups to get code upstream

    http://lists.arm.linux.org.uk/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2004-August/024156.html
    
    - Remove page table fixups for IXP2400 systems.  There is actually some
      confusion b/w myself and Intel on what mappings really needs this and
      we still need to determine a proper clean way to do this. When we have
      that, we'll add support back in. For now I am still able to boot
      on IXP2400 systems.
    
    - Replaced __asm__ __volatile__("":::"memory") with barrier()
    
    - Remove inclusion of mach-types.h in ixdp2x01.h. The machine_is_ixdp2x01()
      macro was only being used in one place, so just check for
      (machine_is_ixdp2401() || machine_is_ixdp2801())

    [PATCH] ppc32: fix the 'checkbin' target
    
    The checkbin target on PPC32 isn't quite right.
    
    First, one of the tests (to ensure that some instructions are known to
    gas) is never actually invoked because 'checkbin' doesn't know about
    stuff set in .config, so we always have the 'else' case run.  This
    changes to always running the test and telling the user to upgrade to at
    least binutils 2.12.1.
    
    The next problem is that we were doing $(AS) -o /dev/null ...  in both
    that test, as well as another.  The problem here is that the checkbin
    target is run on the install targets, meaning that /dev/null will get
    unlinked when the test passes.  To get around this we use .tmp_gas_check
    as the output file instead.

    [PATCH] nfs ->follow_link() switched to new scheme
    
    NFS takes some thought to switch to the new symlink scheme, because we
    can't rely on the pagecache lookup to find the symlink page when freeing
    it - the cache might have been invalidated in the meantime.
    
    So we hide the page information in the symlink data area itself,
    by stealing the last pointer in the page used for the cache. That
    way nfs_put_link() can just look up the page directly.

    with an too old BIOS. I got a lot of cryptic "init not cpu 0"
    messages until the "MP systems not supported by PSB ..." message.
    
    This patch switches the order of the checks around to print the
    other message first. It will be still printed multiple times
    because the cpufreq setup will probe all CPUs, but that's probably
    ok.

    [CPUFREQ] Remove duplicate information brought in with the new governor.
    
    The current CPU frequency is already exported one directory upwards, so there
    is no need to duplicate it in the ondemand governor.

    [CPUFREQ] Fix up ARM drivers 'out of sync' problem.
    The SA1100 and SA1110 platforms can handle situations well where the
    CPU frequency is different to the value the cpufreq (and timing) code
    thinks it is, e.g. when resuming from sleep. So, remove the flags
    noting the opposite.

    Allow the compiler to notice "constant" header file.
    
    Both gcc and sparse will speed up tokenization by noticing
    when a header file is protected by the standard preprocessor
    #ifndef .. #endif exclusion.
    
    However, that requires that the headers actually _use_ that
    standard exclusion. Some did their own little broken dance.

    [PATCH] s390: kernel stack options.
    
    This adds support for the new compiler options -mkernel-backchain,
    -mstack-size, -mstack-guard, -mwarn-dynamicstack and -mwarn-framesize.
    
    The option -mkernel-backchain enables the use of modified layout for the
    stack frames of kernel functions.  This breaks the ABI, modules compiled
    with the option won't work on a kernel compiled with the option and vice
    versa.  The positive effect of the option is a drastic reduction of kernel
    stack use.  The trick is that the new frame layout allows to overlap the 96
    (31 bit)/160 (64 bit) byte bias areas of the functions on the call chain.
    This lowers the minimal stack usage of a function from 96 bytes to 16 bytes
    (31 bit) and 160 bytes to 24 bytes (64 bit).  The kernel stack use is
    decreased to a point where it is possible to use 4K (31 bit) / 8K (64 bit)
    stacks.  The split into process stack and interrupt stack is already in
    place.
    
    The options -mstack-size and -mstack-guard are used to detect kernel stack
    overflows.  The compiler adds code to the prolog of every function that
    causes an illegal operation if the kernel stack is about to overflow.
    
    The options -mwarn-dynamicstack and -mwarn-framesize cause the compiler to
    emit warnings if a function uses dynamic stack allocation or if the
    function frame size is bigger then a specified limit.
    
    To play safe all the new options are configurable.

    This patch fixes a problem reported by David S. Miller <davem@redhat.com>
    
    "I just noticed that fb_{read,write}() uses copy_*_user() with
     the kernel buffer being the frame buffer.  It needs to use
     the proper device address accessor functions."
    
    The patch will do an intermediate copy of the contents to a page-sized,
    kmalloc'ed buffer.

    [PATCH] interrupt driven hvc_console as vio device
    
    This is an hvc_console patch which provides driver and ppc64 architecture
    fixes to enable the hvc_console driver to register itself as a vio device
    with the vio bus, provide hotplug add/remove for vty adapters, and act as
    an interrupt driven driver on Power-5 hardware or remain as a polling
    driver on Power-4 hardware.
    
    arch/ppc64/kernel/hvconsole.c
    =============================
    
    - Changed hvc_get_chars() and hvc_put_chars() api to take vtermno rather
      than index number.
    
    - Added hvc_find_vtys() function which walks the bus looking for
      vterm/vty devices to callback to the hvc_console driver.  This provides
      console output functionality prior to early console init (pre mem init
      and pre device probe).
    
    include/asm-ppc64/hvconsole.h
    =============================
    
    - Changed hvc_get_chars() and hvc_put_chars() api to take vtermno rather
      than index number.
    
    - Added hvc_find_vtys() function.
    
    - Added hvc_instantiate() function which is implemented by a console
      driver wanting to receive a callback of and early console init.
    
    drivers/char/hvc_console.c
    ==========================
    
    - Switch khvcd from kernel_threads to kthreads which got rid of
      deprecated daemonize().
    
    - Added module exit clause to be thorough (not terribly necessary with a
      console driver of course)
    
    - Added early discovery of vterm/vty adapters by doing a bus walk on
      early console init which results in hvc_instantiate() callback and
      addition of the vtermno into a static array of vtermnos supported as
      console adapters (meaning the console api's work against these vtermnos
      prior to full console initialization).
    
    - This driver is now registered as a vio driver which means that vty
      adapters are now managed via probe/remove.  This means hvc_console
      supports hotplug vty adapters.
    
    - Driver now requests more device nodes than what was found on the
      initial bus walk when registered as a tty driver to make room for hotplug
      vty adapters.  These secondary vty adapters provide a tty tunnel between
      partitions.
    
    - Removed static hvc_struct array and replaced with a linux list that has
      elements (hvc_struct instances) added/removed on probe/remove AFTER early
      console init.  This is important because kmalloc can't be done at early
      console init.
    
    - Driver now either runs in interrupt driven mode or in polling mode on
      older hardware.  The khvcd is smart enough to not 'schedule()' when there
      are no interrupts.
    
    - kobjects are now used for ref counting on the hvc_struct instances.
    
    - This driver puts the tty layer to sleep on hvc_close() if there are
      pending data writes being blocked by firmware.
    
    - Removed useless spinlocks in hvc_chars_in_buffer() and hvc_write_room.

    This patch allows i386 signal delivery to work correctly when userspace is
    compiled with -mregparm.  This is somewhat hacky: it passes the arguments
    *both* on the stack and in registers, but it works because there are only
    one or three (depending on SA_SIGINFO) official arguments.  If you're
    relying on the unofficial arguments then you're doing something nonportable
    anyway and can put in the __attribute__((cdecl,regparm(0))) in the correct
    place.

    There are a couple of places where we seem to go round the houses to get

    Both lookup_node and enqueue_huge_page use page_zone() to locate the zone,
    that to locate node pgdat_t and that to get the node_id.  Its more
    efficient to use page_to_nid() which gets the nid from the page flags,
    especially if we are not using the zone for anything else it.  Change these
    to use page_to_nid().

    [PATCH] Amiga partition reading fix
    
    I have a large archive of files stored on Amiga volumes.  Many of these
    volumes are on Fujitsu magneto-optical disks with 2k sector size.  The
    existing partitioning code cannot properly read them since it appears the
    OS automatically deblocks the large sectors into logical 512 byte sectors,
    something AmigaDOS never did.  I arranged the partitioning code to handle
    this situation.
    
    Second I have some rather strange test case disks, including my largest
    storage partition, that have somewhat unusual partition values.  As such I
    needed additional information in addition to the first and last block
    number information.  AmigaDOS reserves N blocks, with N greater than or
    equal to 1 and less than the size of the partition, for some boot time
    information and signatures.  I have some partitions that use other than the
    usual value of 2.
    
    There is one more "fix" that could be put in if someone needs it.  Another
    value in the "Rigid Disk Blocks" description of a partition is a "PreAlloc"
    value.  It defines a number of blocks at the end of the disk that are not
    considered to be a real part of the partition.  This was "important" in the
    days of 20 meg and 40 meg hard disks.  It is hardly important and not used
    on modern drives without special user intervention.
    
    This partitioning information is known correct.  I wrote the low level
    portion of the hard disk partitioning code for AmigaDOS 3.5 and 3.9.  I am
    also responsible for one of the more frequently used partitioning tools,
    RDPrepX, before that.

    [PATCH] use hlist for pid hash
    
    Use hlists for the PID hashes.  This halves the memory footprint of these
    hashes.  No benchmarks, but I think this is a worthy improvement because
    the hashes are something that would be likely to have significant portions
    loaded into the cache of every CPU on some workloads.
    
    This comes at the "expense" of
    	1. reintroducing the memory  prefetch into the hash traversal loop;
    	2. adding new pids to the head of the list instead of the tail. I
    	   suspect that if this was a big problem then the hash isn't sized
    	   well or could benefit from moving hot entries to the head.
    
    Also, account for all the pid hashes when reporting hash memory usage.

    [PATCH] fix PID hash sizing
    
    A 4GB, 4-way Opteron would create the smallest size table (16 entries) because
    pidhash_init is called before mem_init which is where x86-64 sets up max_pfn.
    
    nr_kernel_pages is setup by paging_init, called from setup_arch, which is also
    where i386 sets up max_pfn.
    
    So export nr_kernel_pages, nr_all_pages.  Use nr_kernel_pages when sizing the
    PID hash.  This fixes the problem.
    
    This also makes the pid hash dependant on the size of ZONE_NORMAL instead of
    total size of memory.

    [PATCH] fix rusage semantics
    
    This patch changes the rusage bookkeeping and the semantics of the
    getrusage and times calls in a couple of ways.
    
    The first change is in the c* fields counting dead child processes.  POSIX
    requires that children that have died be counted in these fields when they
    are reaped by a wait* call, and that if they are never reaped (e.g.
    because of ignoring SIGCHLD, or exitting yourself first) then they are
    never counted.  These were counted in release_task for all threads.  I've
    changed it so they are counted in wait_task_zombie, i.e.  exactly when
    being reaped.
    
    POSIX also specifies for RUSAGE_CHILDREN that the report include the reaped
    child processes of the calling process, i.e.  whole thread group in Linux,
    not just ones forked by the calling thread.  POSIX specifies tms_c[us]time
    fields in the times call the same way.  I've moved the c* fields that
    contain this information into signal_struct, where the single set of
    counters accumulates data from any thread in the group that calls wait*.
    
    Finally, POSIX specifies getrusage and times as returning cumulative totals
    for the whole process (aka thread group), not just the calling thread.
    I've added fields in signal_struct to accumulate the stats of detached
    threads as they die.  The process stats are the sums of these records plus
    the stats of remaining each live/zombie thread.  The times and getrusage
    calls, and the internal uses for filling in wait4 results and siginfo_t,
    now iterate over the threads in the thread group and sum up their stats
    along with the stats recorded for threads already dead and gone.
    
    I added a new value RUSAGE_GROUP (-3) for the getrusage system call rather
    than changing the behavior of the old RUSAGE_SELF (0).  POSIX specifies
    RUSAGE_SELF to mean all threads, so the glibc getrusage call will just
    translate it to RUSAGE_GROUP for new kernels.  I did this thinking that
    someone somewhere might want the old behavior with an old glibc and a new
    kernel (it is only different if they are using CLONE_THREAD anyway).
    However, I've changed the times system call to conform to POSIX as well and
    did not provide any backward compatibility there.  In that case there is
    nothing easy like a parameter value to use, it would have to be a new
    system call number.  That seems pretty pointless.  Given that, I wonder if
    it is worth bothering to preserve the compatible RUSAGE_SELF behavior by
    introducing RUSAGE_GROUP instead of just changing RUSAGE_SELF's meaning.
    Comments?
    
    I've done some basic testing on x86 and x86-64, and all the numbers come
    out right after these fixes.  (I have a test program that shows a few

    [PATCH] waitid system call
    
    This patch adds a new system call `waitid'.  This is a new POSIX call that
    subsumes the rest of the wait* family and can do some things the older
    calls cannot.  A minor addition is the ability to select what kinds of
    status to check for with a mask of independent bits, so you can wait for
    just stops and not terminations, for example.  A more significant
    improvement is the WNOWAIT flag, which allows for polling child status
    without reaping.  This interface fills in a siginfo_t with the same details
    that a SIGCHLD for the status change has; some of that info (e.g.  si_uid)
    is not available via wait4 or other calls.
    
    I've added a new system call that has the parameter conventions of the
    POSIX function because that seems like the cleanest thing.  This patch
    includes the actual system call table additions for i386 and x86-64; other
    architectures will need to assign the system call number, and 64-bit ones
    may need to implement 32-bit compat support for it as I did for x86-64.
    The new features could instead be provided by some new kludge inventions in
    the wait4 system call interface (that's what BSD did).  If kludges are
    preferable to adding a system call, I can work up something different.
    
    I added a struct rusage field si_rusage to siginfo_t in the SIGCHLD case
    (this does not affect the size or layout of the struct).  This is not part
    of the POSIX interface, but it makes it so that `waitid' subsumes all the
    functionality of `wait4'.  Future kernel ABIs (new arch's or whatnot) can
    have only the `waitid' system call and the rest of the wait* family
    including wait3 and wait4 can be implemented in user space using waitid.
    There is nothing in user space as yet that would make use of the new field.
    
    Most of the new functionality is implemented purely in the waitid system
    call itself.  POSIX also provides for the WCONTINUED flag to report when a
    child process had been stopped by job control and then resumed with
    SIGCONT.  Corresponding to this, a SIGCHLD is now generated when a child
    resumes (unless SA_NOCLDSTOP is set), with the value CLD_CONTINUED in
    siginfo_t.si_code.  To implement this, some additional bookkeeping is
    required in the signal code handling job control stops.
    
    The motivation for this work is to make it possible to implement the POSIX
    semantics of the `waitid' function in glibc completely and correctly.  If
    changing either the system call interface used to accomplish that, or any
    details of the kernel implementation work, would improve the chances of
    getting this incorporated, I am more than happy to work through any issues.

    [PATCH] Using get_cycles for add_timer_randomness
    
    I tested how long it took to do a dd from /dev/random on ppc64 before and
    after this patch, while doing a ping flood from another machine.
    
    before:
    # /usr/bin/time dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/zero count=1k
    0+51 records in
    Command terminated by signal 2
    0.00user 0.00system 19:18.46elapsed 0%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
    
    I gave up after 19 minutes.
    
    after:
    # /usr/bin/time dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/zero count=1k
    0+1024 records in
    0.00user 0.00system 0:33.38elapsed 0%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
    
    Just over 33 seconds. Better.
    
    From: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>
    
    I noticed that only i386 and x86-64 are currently using a high resolution
    timer source when adding randomness.  Since many architectures have a
    working get_cycles() implementation, it seems rather straightforward to use
    that.
    
    Has this been discussed before, or can anyone comment on the implementation
    below?
    
    This patch attempts to take into account the size of cycles_t, which is
    either 32 or 64 bits wide but independent of the architecture's word size.
    
    The behavior should be nearly identical to the old one on i386, x86-64 and
    all architectures without a time stamp counter, while finding more entropy
    on the other architectures.

    [PATCH] hugetlbfs private mappings
    
    Hugetlbfs silently coerce private mappings of hugetlb files into shared
    ones.  So private writable mapping has MAP_SHARED semantics.  I think, such
    mappings should be disallowed.
    
    First, such behavior allows open hugetlbfs file O_RDONLY, and overwrite it
    via mmap(PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE), so it is security bug.
    
    Second, private writable mmap() should fail just because kernel does not
    support this.
    
    I belisve, it is ok to allow private readonly hugetlb mappings,
    sys_mprotect() does not work with hugetlb vmas.
    
    There is another problem.  Hugetlb mapping is always prefaulted, pages
    allocated at mmap() time.  So even readonly mapping allows to enlarge the
    size of the hugetlbfs file, and steal huge pages without appropriative
    permissions.

    [PATCH] Jumper Probes to provide function arguments
    
    A special kprobe type which can be placed on function entry points, and
    employs a simple mirroring principle to allow seamless access to the
    arguments of a function being probed.  The probe handler routine should
    have the same prototype as the function being probed.  Currently
    implemented for x86.
    
    The way it works is that when the probe is hit, the breakpoint handler
    simply irets to the probe handler's eip while retaining register and stack
    state corresponding to the function entry.  After it is done, the probe
    handler calls jprobe_return() which traps again to restore processor state
    and switch back to the probed function.  Linus noted correctly at KS that
    we need to be careful as gcc assumes that the callee owns arguments.  We
    save and restore enough stack bytes to cover argument space.
    
    Sample Usage:
    	static int jip_queue_xmit(struct sk_buff *skb, int ipfragok)
    	{
    		... whatever ...
    		jprobe_return();
    		return 0;
    	}
    
    	struct jprobe jp = {
    		{.addr = (kprobe_opcode_t *) ip_queue_xmit},
    		.entry = (kprobe_opcode_t *) jip_queue_xmit
    	};
    	register_jprobe(&jp);

    [PATCH] kprobes base patch
    
    This patch helps developers to trap at almost any kernel code address,
    specifying a handler routine to be invoked when the breakpoint is hit.
    
    Useful for analysing the Linux kernel by collecting debugging information
    non-disruptively.  Employs single-stepping out-of-line to avoid probe
    misses on SMP and may be especially useful in aiding debugging elusive
    races and problems on live systems.  More elaborate dynamic tracing tools
    such as DProbes can be built over the kprobes interface.

    [PATCH] platform update for ES7000
    
    This update only applies to Unisys' ES7000 server machines.  The patch adds
    a OEM id check to verify the current machine running is actually a Unisys
    type box before executing the Unisys OEM parser routine.  It also increases
    the MAX_MP_BUSSES definition from 32 to 256.  On the ES7000s, bus ID
    numbering can range from 0 to 255.  Without the patch, the system panics if
    booted with acpi=off.
    
    This patch has been tested and verified on an authentic ES7000 machine.

    prototype for prio_tree_remove in mm/prio_tree.c is inside another

    Apparently this isnt valid C, so lets fix it up.

    Prevent IRQ race conditions between the two handlers and within the

    Also, we may receive the "data end" interrupt prior to finishing a
    transfer from the card, so mask this off until we've read the last
    bytes from the FIFO.

    [PKT_SCHED]: Distribution table fixes for netem.
    
    Fix some issues with netem.
     * fix memory link in q_destroy where distribution table not freed
     * fix math error in tabledist that made it work for only small values
     * change API for distribution table so scaling factor is constant and
       table size is determined by looking at the rtnetlink payload size.
       this is faster and simpler. Since haven't actually released the tools to load
       the table yet, this is the chance to get it right ;-)

    Argh.. random_init isn't called until the device's are initialized.
    Rather than mess with random.c initialization, how about this; it resets

    [IPV4/IPV6]: Fix fragment creation.
    
    We have two problem in ipv4 and ipv6 wrt. to
    fragmentation on output.  Both of which result
    in fragmentation when it is really not needed.
    
    When fragmenting both ipv4 and ipv6 need to make
    the post IP-header portion of the packet have a
    length of modulo 8.  This means that if the PMTU
    is not a multiple of 8 after the IP header size
    is subtracted, we will fragment for full sized
    frames for the modulo 8 bytes.
    
    Furthermore, IPV6 subtracts out space for the
    fragmentation header it must add, making unnecessary
    fragmentation even more likely.
    
    We still need to handle ip*_append_page() and that
    will happen in a followup fix.

    [PATCH] Fix DMA boundary overflow bug
    
    We seem to have found an overflow problem in libata-core.c.
    We were trying to DMA to the address range 0xffff8000-0xffffbfff.
    
    In the original version of the code, given that address and
    count (0xffff8000 and 0x4000), the variable "boundary" would be
    set to 0, causing len to be set to 0x8000 (which is greater than
    sg_len).  Then at the bottom of the loop, sg_len would be set
    to 0xffffc000 (0x4000 - 0x8000), which would then cause the
    loop never to terminate (until much of memory was scribbled
    over or the kernel died).
    
    The code below should be functionally identical, but not be
    subject to the same overflow problem (boundary needs to be a
    u33).

    [PATCH] Problem with SiS900 - Unknown PHY
    
    From: Laurent <laurent@gobio2.net>
    
    Some time ago, I sent on this list a mail about my strange problem with my
    SiS900 network card (Subject was Sluggish performances with FreeBSD)
    
    To sum up, when my card is in 100Mb mode, I have poor throughput but in
    10Mb, all seems normal.
    
    After some tests, it seems these results was due to a misdetection of the
    PHY device.  mii-tool reports :
    
     product info: vendor 08:00:17, model 3 rev 0
    
    and after some search on the web, I found it's a NS DP83847 which is very
    similar.

    [PATCH] ide: identify non decoded master/slave by serial and model
    
    From: Alan Cox <alan@redhat.com>
    
    Some interfaces (notably PCMCIA ones) don't decode the master/slave select so
    you get two copies of a device appearing and bad things happening if a user
    accidentally uses both.
    
    This checks for the model/serial matching but also knows about non ATA drives
    ide=noprobe and a Maxtor problem that was found in Andrew's testing of an
    earlier patch. Although M00000.. drives should be RMA'd to Maxtor (and with
    info on where they were obtained...) we don't want to break anyone who has
    them.

    [PATCH] ide: fix bad disk geometry hang
    
    From: Alan Cox <alan@redhat.com>
    
    If you get invalid geometry (eg a failed drive) the box hangs on boot because
    we try and unregister the registered driver and end up in a locking mess.
    
    We change the behaviour to simply leave the device unattached which avoids
    the mess.

    [PATCH] ide: do hwif spin up for all platforms
    
    From: Alan Cox <alan@redhat.com>
    
    This was put in for PPC specifically and defined in the 2.4 tree to be
    paranoid about breaking stuff. The actual wait for hwif spin up is however
    perfectly correct for all drives. In the normal PC case the PC BIOS has done
    this but with other embedded boxes and with things like LinuxBIOS it may not
    have done. Thus it should always be done.

    [PATCH] ide: remove /proc/ide/hd?/settings:ide-scsi & HDIO_SET_IDE_SCSI ioctl
    
    As noticed by Alan Cox:
    
    "It doesn't work now so it clearly isnt being used 8). We hold the lock
    because its a proc function and we then replace the proc functions in the
    attach method -> deadlock. It is also incredibly hard to fix without a
    major rewrite."
    
    The same is true for HDIO_SET_IDE_SCSI ioctl.
    
    Both were broken 18 months ago in 2.5.63 as a side-effect of locking fixes.

    ~0x0UL passed in u32 argument will do what the authors wanted, but it's
    a hell of a silly way to spell ~0U on 32bit boxen and it generates warnings on
    64bit boxen (we get correct value after truncation, but compiler doesn't
    know that ;-)

    [PATCH] ad1848 check_region() removal
    
    * ports for ad1848 are now claimed by callers

    * ports for mss are now claimed by callers (both config and ad1848 ones)

    * attach_ms_sound() gets the same pointer and consumes both regions.

    [IPV6] XFRM: extract xfrm_lookup() from ip6_dst_lookup() to support source routing appropriately.
    
    This patch extracts xfrm_lookup() from ip6_dst_lookup()
    to support source routing appropriately.
    
    This is because xfrm_lookup() should be performed with the final
    destination while ip6_dst_lookup() is called with the next-hop.

    [SPARC64]: Fix delay with HZ==1000.
    
    When I moved sparc64 over to HZ==1000 this added some
    problems to the udelay() handling.  Specifically, with
    slower cpus we could now get underflows to zero for
    things like udelay(1) due to the order of multiplies
    and shifts.
    
    Fix this, and move it out to arch/sparc64/lib/delay.c
    so it is easier to tinker with this in the future and
    also to optimize away one of the multiplies for the
    constant delay case just like other platforms do.

    [PATCH] really uninline lmc_trace
    
    As part of some gcc 3.4 fixes, someone removed the inline from the
    prototype of lmc_trace in lmc_debug.c, but the useless inline at the actual
    function remained.

    [PATCH] HVCS hotplug fixes
    
    Here is an HVCS (drivers/char/hvcs.c) patch which fixes the hvcs driver
    problems with hotplugged vty-server adapters.  The current driver handles
    the adapter index assignment improperly so after a number of device
    removals and insertions the driver could no longer map a tty->index to a
    vty-server properly and tty_open() attempts would fail.  This patch solves
    this problem by always assigning the lowest available index to the new
    adapters and returning an index to the list when the adapter is removed.
    
    changelog:
    drivers/char/hvcs.c
    ===================
    -Added hvcs_index_list to manage the lowest available index.
    
    -Added four helper functions to manage the list, which include the
    creation and destruction of the list, the get'ing of the lowest index,
    and the returning of an index.
    
    -Moved free_irq() outside of the hvcs_final_close() function in order to
    get it out of the spinlock.
    
    -Rearranged hvcs_close() to accomodate the previous change.
    
    -Removed local CLC_LENGTH define and used HVCS_CLC_LENGTH from
    arch/ppc64/hvcserver.h instead.
    
    -Cleaned up some printks and did some house keeping on the changelog.
    
    Documentation/powerpc/hvcs.txt
    ==============================
    -Added information on sysfs 'index' attribute added in previous hvcs
    patch.
    
    -Added Q & A section on how to find the proper dev node for a newly
    added adapter.
    
    I think this is the last of the HVCS patches for a while, as all of my
    oustanding issues have been dealt with.

    There is a minor problem in function start_kernel.  start_kernel will
    enable interrupt after calling profile_init.  However, before that,
    function time_init on IA64 platform could enable interrupt.  See this call
    sequence:
    
      start_kernel

        ->ia64_init_itm

    [PATCH] Fix copying of unaligned data across user/kernel boundary
    
    32 bit compatibility code sometimes needs to copy unaligned data across
    kernel/user boundary and currently there is no architecture independent API
    to do it.
    
    (1) Introduce new APIs __{get,put}_user_unaligned. These APIs are
        necessary because the optimal way to copy unaligned data across
        kernel/user boundary is different on different architectures.
        Some architectures don't even care about alignment.
        On some __put_user is faster than __copy_to_user for small sizes.
    (2) Optimize __{get,put}_user_unaligned for ia64, x86-64, s390, ppc64.
    (3) Fix compat_filldir64() which is broken on big-endian machines

    [PATCH] parport: NetMOS 9805 interface
    
    Add support for netmos devices to the parallel port driver.
    
    NetMOS 9805 support is already in the kernel, this patch adds the support for
    the missing 9735,9855,9755 and 9715 chips.
    
    And another remark: The 9735 and 9835 seem to be chips with serial *and*
    parallel interfaces, so I suppose they are already claimed somewhere in the
    serial driver.  I don't know whether this causes any problems.  I'm sorry that
    I can't test, I've only a 9805 here.  Any idea how these "dual" chips have to
    be handled by the kernel?

    [PATCH] O(1) proc_pid_statm()
    
    Merely removing down_read(&mm->mmap_sem) from task_vsize() is too
    half-assed to let stand. The following patch removes the vma iteration
    as well as the down_read(&mm->mmap_sem) from both task_mem() and
    task_statm() and callers for the CONFIG_MMU=y case in favor of
    accounting the various stats reported at the times of vma creation,
    destruction, and modification. Unlike the 2.4.x patches of the same
    name, this has no per-pte-modification overhead whatsoever.
    
    This patch quashes end user complaints of top(1) being slow as well as
    kernel hacker complaints of per-pte accounting overhead simultaneously.

    [PATCH] task_vsize() locking cleanup
    
    task_vsize() doesn't need mm->mmap_sem for the CONFIG_MMU case; the
    semaphore doesn't prevent mm->total_vm from going stale or getting
    inconsistent with other numbers regardless.  Also, KSTK_EIP() and
    KSTK_ESP() don't want or need protection from mm->mmap_sem either.  So this
    pushes mm->mmap_sem to task_vsize() in the CONFIG_MMU=n task_vsize().
    
    Also, hoist the prototype of task_vsize() into proc_fs.h
    
    The net result of this is a small speedup of procps for CONFIG_MMU.

    I'm sure there's a good reason for these functions to take virtual addresses

    [PATCH] reduce casting in sysenter.c
    
    Ran across this because it's another place where an unsigned long is passed
    directly to __pa().  Making the "page" variable a void* seems a bit more
    natural than an unsigned long and reduces the net number of casts by 1.
    Without it, we probably need another (void *) cast in the __pa() call.
    
    For more explanation as to why this was probably done originally, see this

    [PATCH] fix MT reparenting when thread group leader dies
    
    When the initial thread in a multi-threaded program dies (the thread group
    leader), its child processes are wrongly orphaned, and thereafter when
    other threads die their child processes are also orphaned even though live
    threads remain in the parent process that can call wait.  I have a small
    (under 100 lines), POSIX-compliant test program that demonstrates this
    using -lpthread (NPTL) if anyone is interested in seeing it.
    
    The bug is that forget_original_parent moves children to the dead parent's
    group leader if it's alive, but if not it orphans them.  I've changed it so
    it instead reparents children to any other live thread in the dead parent's
    group (not even preferring the group leader).  Children go to init only if
    there are no live threads in the parent's group at all.  These are the
    correct semantics for fork children of POSIX threads.
    
    The second part of the change is to do the CLONE_PARENT behavior always for
    CLONE_THREAD, i.e.  make sure that each new thread's parent link points to
    the real parent of the process and never another thread in its own group.
    Without this, when the group leader dies leaving a sole live thread in the
    group, forget_original_parent will try to reparent that thread to itself
    because it's a child of the dying group leader.  Rather handling this case
    specially to reparent to the group leader's parent instead, it's more
    efficient just to make sure that noone ever has a parent link to inside his
    own thread group.  Now the reparenting work never needs to be done for
    threads created in the same group when their creator thread dies.  The only
    change from losing the who-created-whom information is when you look at
    "PPid:" in /proc/PID/task/TID/status.  For purposes of all direct system
    calls, it was already as if CLONE_THREAD threads had the parent of the
    group leader.  (POSIX provides no way to keep track of which thread created
    which other thread with pthread_create.)

    [PATCH] dnotify + autofs may create signal/restart syscall loop
    
    I saw a recent bug report that showed when a process set up a dnotify against
    the autofs root and then attempted an access(2) call inside the autofs
    namespace on a mount that would fail, it would create a signal/restart loop.
    
    The cause is that the autofs code checks to see if any signals are pending
    after it waits on a response from the autofs daemon.  If it finds any, it
    assumes that autofs_wait was interrupted, and that it should return
    -ERESTARTNOINTR.  The problem with this is that a signal_pending(current)
    check will return true if *any* signals were received, not just if a signal
    that interrupted the wait was received.  autofs_wait explicitly blocks all
    signals except for SIGKILL, SIGQUIT, and SIGINT before calling
    interruptible_sleep_on.
    
    The effect is that if a dnotify is set against the autofs root, when the
    autofs daemon creates the directory, a dnotify event will be sent to the
    originating process.  Since the code in autofs_root_lookup doesn't check to
    see what signals are actually pending, it bails early, telling the caller to
    try again.  The loop goes on forever until interrupted via one of the actual
    interrupting signals.
    
    The following patch makes both autofs_root_lookup and autofs4_root_lookup
    verify that one of its defined "shutdown" signals are pending before bailing
    out early.  Any other signal should be delivered later, as expected.  It
    doesn't matter if the signal occured outside of the sleep in autofs_wait.  The
    calling process will either go away or try again.

    inconsistently.  This makes it cpumask_t across the board, and consolidates
    the handling in kernel/profile.c

    [PATCH] schedule profileing
    
    From: William Lee Irwin III <wli@holomorphy.com>
    
    The patch (from Ingo) below is quite interesting, it allows the use of
    readprofile not for statistical tine sampling, but for seeing where calls to
    schedule() come from, so it can give some insight to the "where do my context
    switches come from" question.
    
    Boot with `profile=schedul2' to activate this feature.

    [PATCH] Hotplug CPU vs TASK_ZOMBIEs: The Sequel to Hotplug CPU vs TASK_DEAD
    
    release_task can sleep.  Sleeping allows a CPU to go down underneath you.
    release_task removes you from the tasklist, so you don't get migrated off the
    CPU: BUG() in sched.c.
    
    In last week's episode, our dashing hero (Ingo Molnar) solved this for
    self-reaping tasks by grabbing the hotplug cpu lock to prevent this.
    However, in an unexpected twist, the problem remains for tasks whose
    parents call release_task on them: the zombies are off the task list, and
    lurk on the dead CPU.
    
    Fortunately, the comedic sidekick (Rusty Russell) has an answer: let's make
    the hotplug callback walk the runqueue of the dead CPU as well, taking care
    of the zombies.
    
    1) Restore exit.c to its former form.  The comment is incorrect: sched.c
       checks PF_DEAD, not the state, to decide to do the final
       put_task_struct(), and it does it for all tasks, self-reaping or no.
    
    2) Implement migrate_dead_tasks() in the sched.c hotplug CPU callback.
    
    3) Rename migrate_all_tasks() to migrate_live_tasks().

    [PATCH] md: fix problems with checksum handling in MD superblocks.
    
    md currently uses csum_partial to calculate checksums for superblocks.
    However this function is not consistent across all architectures.  Some
    (i386) to a 32bit csum.  Some (alpha) do a 16 bit csum.  This makes it hard
    for userspace to keep up.
    
    So we provide a generic routine (that does exactly what the i386
    csum_partial does) and:
    
    - When setting the csum, use csum_partial so that old kernels will still
      recognise the superblock
    
    - When checking the csum, allow either csum_partial or the new generic
      code to provide the right csum.  This allows user-space to just use the
      common code and always work.
    
    Also modify the csum for version-1 superblock (which currently aren't being
    used) to always user a predictable checksum algorithm.
    
    Thanks to Mike Tran <mhtran@us.ibm.com> for noticing this.

       out the old #defines.
    
     - Use newish APIs to let VBUS current be used to recharge

    [TCP]: Automatically compute tcp_default_win_scale.
    
    This patch gets rid of the tcp_default_win_scale sysctl and instead
    computes the optimum maximum window scale.  It just means one less
    thing to have to tune.  I also moved the code out of the inline because
    it gets called three places and isn't in the critical path.
    
    As a side effect, it will cause a smaller window scale for many people
    since the default tcp_rmem fits in a win_scale of 2.  This is allows for
    finer grain windows (good), but may mask some of the problems with bad
    implementations we have already seen (bad).

    [IA64] contig.c: Function find_bootmap_location has 2 bugs.
    
    Firstly, if it's done successfully, it should return -1 instead of 1
    because its caller, efi_memmap_walk, will end when find_bootmap_location
    returns a value smaller than 0.
    
    Secondly, statement "free_start = PAGE_ALIGN(rsvd_region[i].end)" should
    been moved forward. free_start needs to be initialized for every loop
    iteration.  Current implementation is buggy where initialization is
    skipped if range_end <= range_start.  Skipping initializing will leads
    to overlapping bootmap with one of the rsvd_regions and subsequently
    kernel hang at boot time.

    [IA64] Fix boot problems when using "mem=" boot parameter.
    
    My tiger-4 machine has 16GB memory. Kernel 2.6.8 fails to boot on it
    when command line parameter mem=8G, and it also fails when mem being
    set to other value, such as 7G, 10G.
    
    Basically, in function efi_memmap_walk, md->num_pages might be decreased
    if mem_limit is set, and then at the next time when efi_memmap_walk is
    called, trim_top might trim the md again because of IA64_GRANULE_SIZE
    alignment, then another md which is beyond mem_limit at the beginning
    will be chosen, and its physical page number is larger than max_pfn. Then,
    a BUG check is triggered.

    [PATCH] signal-race-fix: ia64
    
    It looks fine to me, except that I decided to play chicken as far as the
    give_sigsegv update of sa_handler is concerned.
    
    Arun, I hope I got the ia32 emulation parts right, but you may want to
    double-check.
    
    The patch seems to work fine as far as I have tested.  I'm seeing some
    oddity in context-switch overhead and pipe latency as reported by LMbench,
    but I suspect that's due to another change that happened somewhere between
    2.6.5-rc1 and Linus' bk tree as of this morning.

    [PATCH] signal-race-fixes: x86-64 support
    
      Add the signal race changes to x86-64 to make it compile again.
    
      Didn't merge the more pointless changes from i386.
    
      Also remove the special SA_ONESHOT handling, doesn't seem to be needed
      anymore.
    
    From: Mikael Pettersson <mikpe@csd.uu.se>
    
      The signal-race-fixes patch in 2.6.8-rc2-mm1 appears to have broken
      x86-64's ia32 emulation.
    
      When forcing a SIGSEGV the old code updated "*ka", where ka was a pointer
      to current's k_sigaction for SIGSEGV.  Now "ka_copy" points to a copy of
      that structure, so assigning "*ka_copy" doesn't do what we want.  Instead do
      the assignment via current->...  just like the normal signal delivery code
      does.

Author: Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>
Date:   Wed Aug 25 04:00:58 2004 -0700

    [PATCH] signal handling race fix
    
    The problem:
    
      In arch/i386/signal.c, in the do_signal() function, it calls
      get_signal_to_deliver() which returns the signal number to deliver (along
      with siginfo).  get_signal_to_deliver() grabs and releases the lock, so
      the signal handler lock is not held in do_signal().  Then the do_signal()
      calls handle_signal(), which uses the signal number to extract the
      sa_handler, etc.
    
      Since no lock is held, it seems like another thread with the same
      signal handler set can come in and call sigaction(), it can change
      sa_handler between the call to get_signal_to_deliver() and fetching the
      value of sa_handler.  If the sigaction() call set it to SIG_IGN, SIG_DFL,
      or some other fundamental change, that bad things can happen.
    
    The patch:
    
      You have to get the sigaction information that will be delivered while
      holding sighand->siglock in get_signal_to_deliver().
    
      In 2.4, it can be fixed per-arch and requires no change to the
      arch-independent code because the arch fetches the signal with
      dequeue_signal() and does all the checking.
    
    The test app:
    
      The program below has three threads that share signal handlers.  Thread
      1 changes the signal handler for a signal from a handler to SIG_IGN and
      back.  Thread 0 sends signals to thread 3, which just receives them.
      What I believe is happening is that thread 1 changes the signal handler
      in the process of thread 3 receiving the signal, between the time that
      thread 3 fetches the signal info using get_signal_to_deliver() and
      actually delivers the signal with handle_signal().
    
      Although the program is obvously an extreme case, it seems like any
      time you set the handler value of a signal to SIG_IGN or SIG_DFL, you can
      have this happen.  Changing signal attributes might also cause problems,
      although I am not so sure about that.

    The ebtables brouting chain, traversed through the call

    Bart discovered this and proposed a patch; this is a revised version.
    This version cleans up the handle_bridge code in net/core/dev.c as well
    as getting rid of extra rcu_read_lock and only does the br_port checking

    Hi,
    
    gcc doesn't understand 80-bit floating point on the ARM currently,
    according to the kernel's Kconfig docs, but it would seem that the
    current extended double emulation code is broken for big endian
    platforms.
    
    So, this patch disables NWFPE_XP on big endian architectures, until
    someone comes round and fixes it.
    
    
    cheers,
    Lennert

    [ARM PATCH] 2046/1: fix nwfpe for double arithmetic on big-endian platforms
    
    Patch from Lennert Buytenhek
    
    Hi,
    
    I need the patch below (against 2.6.8-rc1-ds1) to make nwfpe properly
    emulate arithmetic with doubles on a big endian ARM platform.
    
    From reading the mailing list archives and from helpful comments I've
    received from people on this list, I gather that this has come up in
    the past, but it appears that Russell King was never really convinced
    as to why this patch is needed.  I think I understand what's going on,
    and will try to explain.
    
    On little endian ARM, the double value 1.0 looks like this when stored
    in memory in FPA word ordering:
    bytes: 0x00 0x00 0xf0 0x3f 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
    u32s:  0x3ff00000 0x00000000
    u64:   0x000000003ff00000
    
    On big endian, it looks like this:
    bytes: 0x3f 0xf0 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
    u32s:  0x3ff00000 0x00000000
    u64:   0x3ff0000000000000
    
    It appears to be this way because once upon a time, somebody decided
    that the sub-words of a double will use native endian word ordering
    within themselves, but the two separate words will always be stored
    with the most significant one first.  God knows why they did it this
    way, but they did.
    
    Anyway.  The key observation is that nwfpe internally stores double
    values in the type 'float64', which is basically just a typedef for
    unsigned long long.  It never accesses 'float64's on the byte level
    by casting pointers around or anything like that, it just uses direct
    u64 arithmetic primitives (add, shift, or, and) for float64
    manipulations and that's it.
    
    So.  For little endian platforms, 1.0 looks like:
    0x00 0x00 0xf0 0x3f 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
    But since nwfpe treats it as a u64, it wants it to look like:
    0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0xf0 0x3f
    So, that's why the current code swaps the words around when getting
    doubles from userspace and putting them back (see fpa11_cpdt.c,
    loadDouble and storeDouble.)
    
    On big endian, 1.0 looks like:
    0x3f 0xf0 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
    Since nwfpe treats it as a u64, it wants it to look like:
    0x3f 0xf0 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
    Hey!  That's exactly the same.  So in this case, it shouldn't be
    swapping the halves around.  However, it currently does that swapping
    unconditionally, and that's why floating point emulation messes up.
    
    This is how I understand things -- hope it makes sense to other people
    too.
    
    
    cheers,
    Lennert

    [PATCH] I2C: rename in0_ref to cpu0_vid
    
    This patch changes all the i2c chip drivers and documentation to use the
    name "cpu0_vid" instead of "in0_ref". The name "in0_ref" was an error in
    the first place as motherboard manufacturers may fail to follow the chip
    manufacturer's recommendation about which "in" channel to use for VCore
    monitoring.
    
    The new name leaves room for chips able to monitor more than 1 vid
    value, such as the LM93 and, to a lesser extent, the PC87360 family (all
    by National Semiconductor). These chips are typically designed for
    dual-CPU motherboards.
    
    This breaks the interface (obviously) so libsensors has been updated to
    support both names.

    [PATCH] USB: Use 8-byte hub status URB buffer
    
    This patch changes the size of the buffer allocated for each hub's status
    URB from 3 bytes to 8.  The purpose is to avoid "babble" errors with
    certain buggy hubs.  Although I only know of one type of device which does
    this, the patch does solve its problem and it adds no overhead for anyone
    else since kmalloc doesn't dole out memory in chunks smaller than 8 bytes
    (32 actually, on a PC).
    
    This is a small thing, but it doesn't hurt and it will make life easier
    for a few people.

    [PATCH] MTD: Additional JEDEC device types
    
    Add support for a couple of BIOS ROM devices.
    
    The patch has been committed to the MTD CVS tree and adds entries to
    jedec_probe.c for AMD AM29F002T, Hyundai HY29F002T and Macronix
    MX29F002T parts.
    
    This version is slightly updated from the previous once since I
    accidentally added MANUFACTURER_MACRONIX when it already existed.  I
    also moved the new definitions to go along with the alphabetical by
    manufacturer layout of the file.

    [PATCH] USB: add omap_udc driver
    
    This patch adds a UDC driver for OMAP, which should work on most
    OMAP processors.  It's been tested most on OMAP 1611/5912.  The
    driver supports all USB transfer types (including ISO), has limited
    DMA support, and seems to work with all gadget drivers, both to
    Linux hosts and to MS-Windows ones.
    
    One reason this UDC is particularly interesting is that recent OMAP
    processors all support "USB On-The-Go" (OTG) ... and this driver
    supports it on at least "H2-like" boards.
    
    Another reason is that the UDC is very flexible and fully featured;
    gadget drivers can allocate fifo space to endpoints in the way that's
    most convenient for the application.

    [CPUFREQ] Fix reset-to-max-speed on unloading of longhaul driver.
    
    From: Sven Traenkle
    
    The second part adresses a problem of resetting the max cpu-freq when
    unloading the driver. This didn't work for my cpu and I doubt it does
    for other. There is no need to pass the computed index of the max.
    multiplier in the clock_ratio[] table to longhault_table[] cause the
    longhaul_setstate function works with the clock_ratio[] index.
    
    Changing the while loop to a for loop with upper limit isn't actually
    necessary as long as the driver is bug free, but thats IMHO not yet the
    case, so I suggest this change in order to not loop endlessly or read
    beyond the limits of the clock_ratio array.

    family 6, model 7, VIA Samuel 2). The driver tries to compute the fsb speed
    while it could actually use the fixed values (as it does for model == 6).
    I got this change from the via forum, so no credits to me.

    [PATCH] ppc64: better handling of H_ENTER failures
    
    This changes the hash insertion routines to return an error instead of
    calling panic() when HV refuses to insert a HPTE (the hypervisor call to
    set up a hashtable PTE is H_ENTER).
    
    The error is now propagated upstream, and either bad_page_fault() is
    called (kernel mode) or a SIGBUS signal is forced (user mode).  Some
    other panic() cases are also turned into BUG_ON.
    
    Overall, this should provide us with better debugging data if the
    problem happens, and avoids errors from userland mapping /dev/mem and
    trying to use forbidden IOs (XFree ?) to bring the whole kernel down.

    [PATCH] via-velocity: more inetaddr_notifier fix
    
    From: Francois Romieu <romieu@fr.zoreil.com>
    
    There is no guarantee that the event which gets passed is associated to a
    via-velocity device, thus preventing to dereference dev->priv as if it
    always was a struct velocity_info *.  The via-velocity devices are kept in
    a module private list for comparison.

    sk98line tries to register a procfile with the interfacename of the struct

    unless you change the interface name manually, but as Linux explicitly
    allows that the interface is fundamentally broken and probably should just

    i20 rewrite
    
    From: Markus Lidel <Markus.Lidel@shadowconnect.com>
    
    generic:
    - split i2o_core into several files, grouped by same function
    - I2O devices are now registered as devices and show up in sysfs
    - the various I2O OSM's (e.g. i2o_scsi) now register in the I2O core
       and also use the 2.6 driver mechanism.
    - I2O messages will be created in the message frame instead of creating
       it in local memory and copying it over later on.
    - context list for 64 pointer to 32 context conversion now uses a
       double linked list
    
    PCI:
    - driver now registers as a PCI device driver and uses probe function to
       get the possible controllers. (needed for hotplugging)
    - converted DMA handling from pci_* to generic dma_* functions
    
    Block OSM:
    - use one request queue per I2O block device instead of one per
       controller
    - I2O block devices and queues are allocated dynamically and therefore
       no more limit of block devices
    
    SCSI OSM:
    - corrected bug in SCSI reply function which caused the memory to be
       freed before the done function was called.
    - one I2O controller registers as one scsi host instead of one scsi host
       per channel
    - no more ch,id,lun => tid mapping table
    
    Config OSM:
    - added ioctl32 for passthru and getiops.
    - removed ioctl_html
    
    Documentation:
    - removed TODO entries from README
    - moved docs under Documentation/i2o

    [NET]: Use pskb_expand_head() instead of skb_copy() in skb_checksum_help().
    
    Here is the patch that you wanted to shoot holes at :)
    
    The idea is simple.  None of the callers of skb_checksum are passing it
    skb's which are shared.  They may be cloned however.  But the application
    checksum is always in the skb header so there is no need to linearise it.
    
    Supposing all these assumptions are correct, then we can avoid the overhead
    of skb_copy() and get away with pskb_expand_head().
    
    If the assumption is wrong, we will find out because
    pskb_expand_head() will BUG() if skb_shared() is true.

    [PATCH] USB: Update unlink testing code in the usbtest driver
    
    Greg:
    
    This patch updates the part of the usbtest driver that tests URB
    unlinking.  The move to usb_kill_urb() invalidated some of the old tests.
    There's a corresponding change to the UHCI driver, causing it to return a
    more descriptive error code in the rare event that an URB is cancelled
    after it has been linked but before it has been queued.

    [PATCH] USB: isp1301_omap driver (OTG core)
    
    This adds the isp1301_omap driver, supporting USB OTG on OMAP systems.
    The driver tightly couples two different chunks of hardware, which are
    used to implement the OTG protocols:
    
     - The Philips ISP1301 OTG transceiver (an I2C device) senses voltage
       levels and sources VBUS current in the A-Device roles.
    
     - OMAP's OTG controller handles lots of OTG transitions, and
       tells the transceiver what to do.
    
    The driver implements the abstract "otg_transceiver" API, since it's got to
    talk to both the host controller (OHCI on current OMAPs) and the peripheral
    controller (omap_udc) while hiding a variety of implementation details.  It
    should be easy to tweak to work on other OMAP boards using the isp1301 chip;
    OMAP boards with other transceivers, or non-OMAP boards using isp1301, will
    probably find things to learn from.
    
    Note that this also supports two non-OTG modes, with the OTG controller
    disabled; very handy for debugging just the host side USB stack, or just the
    peripheral side USB stack.

    [PATCH] USB: ohci_omap updates
    
    This updates the OMAP OHCI support to match the latest from the
    Linux-OMAP tree.  Notable changes from the preceding version:
    
      - Use the new USB init model (arch/arm/mach-omap/usb.c).
    
      - The OMAP-specific bus is gone; it now uses platform_device.
        (Update from Tony Lindgren.)
    
      - Works on the H2 board, which requires the external isp1301
        transceiver even in non-OTG configurations.
    
      - Adds OTG support.
    
      - Adds basic power management calls.
    
    The mach-omap/Kconfig file in the main Linux tree is a bit out of
    date, it doesn't know about CONFIG_ARCH_OMAP_OTG (for the OMAPs that
    have OTG silicon).

    [PATCH] USB OTG: usbcore enumeration (3/5)
    
    Teach usbcore how to enumerate OTG devices and perform HNP:
    
     - CONFIG_USB_OTG is a boolean; it selects CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND.
       Boards with a Mini-AB connector should offer it as a config
       option; no other hardware could support OTG.
    
     - Before resetting a port, make sure it's not still suspended.
       (For example, after an HNP role switch.)
    
     - When an OTG A-Host enumerates a dual-role device, set the
       appropriate device feature:  B_HNP_ENABLE if it's connected
       to the OTG port, otherwise A_ALT_HNP_SUPPORT.
    
     - When an OTG B-Host enumerates a dual-role device, don't
       bother debouncing ... the power session is stable already,
       the A-Host already debounced.
    
     - The OTG "Targeted Peripheral List" lives in a product-customized
       "otg_whitelist.h" header.
    
     - CONFIG_USB_OTG_WHITELIST lets developers choose to ignore whitelist
       failures, so unsupported devices can be configured anyway.
    
     - If the whitelist check fails, immediately suspend the device.
    
        * For dual-role devices, that triggers HNP so the other device
          can try to act as host.
    
        * For peripheral-only devices, that conserves power ... but not
          quite as much as turning off power on that port, which should
          eventually be done with OTG ports (and all other ports that
          support SRP).
    
    The whitelist logic tries to make use of the existing usb_device_id
    logic, but since the interface info isn't available that early it's
    a bit awkward use information anywhere outside the device descriptor.

    [PATCH] USB OTG: ohci reset updates (2/5)
    
    Generic OTG and reset support for OTG.
    
     - Declare and use a start_hnp() board-specific procedure.  The OMAP
       implementation will come separately, it can't yet be configured.
    
     - When OTG is configured, implement the usb_bus_start_enum() hook;
       that just starts a root port reset.
    
     - When some task (usually khubd) resets a root port, make sure it takes
       the full 50 msec.  The OHCI reset timer is in hardware, and the host
       may need to issue multiple resets to guard against concurrent resume.
    
     - For backward compatibility, don't kick in the new 50 msec logic unless
       it could be needed:  without CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND, nothing will suspend
       so nothing could resume.  Which is good, at least until we start to
       measure how long a reset takes ... it seems chip-specific.

    [PATCH] Fix fs/locks.c init order
    
    The patch below fixes an interesting oddity we're seeing with fedora core
    development (where we recently started using udev heavily); basically right
    now filelock_init() is a module_init(), eg runs late.  However that breaks
    down because there are earlier /sbin/hotplug callouts, which with udev, do
    locking operations.  When that happens the kernel oopses because the slabs
    for file locks aren't initialized yet.
    
    Solution: initialize this way early.  It's only a kmem_cache_create after
    all, so can happen early.

    [PATCH] inode time update funnies in ncpfs
    
    ncfpfs seems to update inode times by hand everywhere instead of using
    the proper helpers.  This means:
    
     - the atime updates in mmap() and read() seems to miss various checks
       upodate_atime or one of the wrappers does.  Also it doesn't mark the
       inode dirty.
     - in write() you update mtime and _a_time instead of ctime as expected,
       also the usual checks and optimizations are missing.
    
    In addition the fops contain some bogus checks like for a refular file (but
    the fops are only used of ISREG files) and inode->i_sb although that is
    guranteed to be non-zero.

    [PATCH] /dev/random: Add pool name to entropy store
    
    This adds a pool name to the entropy_store data structure, which simplifies

    [PATCH] remove read-only/immutable checks from fat_truncate
    
    From: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>
    
    There's two callers:
    
     - the truncate path via notify_change, ->setattr, vmtruncate.  We
       already check for permissions here at the upper level
     - fat_delete_inode.  This one looks bogus to me - even if we delete
       an read-only or immutable inode we want to free the space allocated
       by it, else you leak disk blocks.

    [PATCH] /proc/PID/cmdline truncates arguments early
    
    We received a bug report that /proc/PID/cmdline only shows argv[0] if the
    total length of all arguments exceeds PAGE_SIZE.  The problem is that
    proc_pid_cmdline checks for the presence of a NUL byte at the end of the
    args list, and assumes that the application did a setproctitle if there's
    any other character.
    
    OTOH proc_pid_cmdline will read just the first PAGE_SIZE worth of arguments
    at most, and if you have more arguments, it's quite likely that there won't
    be a NUL byte at offset PAGE_SIZE-1.
    
    The attached patch fixes this.

    [PATCH] fix bio_uncopy_user() mem leak
    
      When using bounce buffers for SG_IO commands with unaligned buffers in
      blk_rq_map_user(), we should free the pages from blk_rq_unmap_user() which
      calls bio_uncopy_user() for the non-BIO_USER_MAPPED case.  That function
      failed to free the pages for write requests.
    
      So we leaked pages and you machine would go OOM.  Rebooting helped ;-)
    
      This bug was triggered by writing audio CDs (but not on data CDs), as the
      audio frames are not aligned well (2352 bytes), so the user pages don't just
      get mapped.
    
      Bug was reported by Mathias Homan and debugged by Chris Mason + me.  (Jens
      is away.)

    i_blkbits was not being set, and the number KiB in uncompressed ext2 images
    was not taking into account the block size.

    [PATCH] Reduce SELinux kernel memory use on 64-bit systems
    
    The patch below reduces kernel memory used by SELinux policy rules by about
    37% on 64-bit systems.  This is because the size of struct avtab_node is 40
    bytes on 64-bit, and defaults to a size-64 slab.
    
    Creating a slab cache specifically for these structs saves considerable
    amounts of kernel memory on 64-bit systems with large rulesets.  'Strict'
    policy has over 300k rules, while 'targeted' policy has around 3k rules.
    
    Here's the slabtop output with 64 and 40 byte sized slabs to show the
    memory savings, for strict policy:
    
    303475 303447  99%    0.06K   4975       61     19900K avtab_node
    303456 303447  99%    0.04K   3161       96     12644K avtab_node
    
    Also, there are 57% more objects per slab.

    [PATCH] SELinux: revalidate access to controlling tty
    
    This patch changes the SELinux flush_unauthorized_files function to also
    recheck access to the controlling tty and reset it if it is no longer
    accessible under the new security context.  This patch is relative to the
    selinuxfs devnull patch.

    [PATCH] reiserfs: xattr/acl fixes
    
    Here are a few fixes for bugs noticed on reiserfs-list or our own bugzilla.
    
    Attached is a patch that fixes several problems with xattrs/acls:
    [SECURITY] Fixes the inode not getting dirtied when mode is set
               via setxattr()
    [CORRECTNESS] Fixes the inode not getting ctime updated when an xattr is
                  removed
    [DATA] Fixes an issue with dcache hash colliding names in the filesystem
           root caused by the d_compare to hide .reiserfs_priv. The bug
           can only occur in the filesystem root, which is why we haven't
           seen many (any, outside of the suse bugzilla, afaik) reports on
           this. The results are that dcache operations on colliding entries
           in the fs root will choose the first match rather than the
           correct entry.

    [PATCH] USB: Set QH bit in UHCI framelist entries
    
    This patch fixes the error in the UHCI driver found by Stuart Hayes.  It
    adds the UHCI_PTR_QH bit into the initial entries stored in the hardware
    framelist.  It's not entirely clear how the driver ever managed to work
    with these bits not set; apparently by coincidence the QH entries
    resembled TD entries sufficiently closely to fool the hardware.

    [PATCH] remove cacheline alignment from inode slabs
    
    Most of the inode slabs are cacheline aligned.  This can waste a fair
    amount of memory, especially on architectures with large cacheline sizes
    (eg 128 bytes).
    
    Alignment has a few advantages.  It prevents 2 cpus from accessing 2 data
    structures in the same cacheline.  Since struct inodes are well over a
    cacheline and there are so many of them, there is little chance we will hit
    this problem if we remove the alignment.
    
    Alignment also ensures the maximum amount of the data structure is in the
    same cacheline (instead of straddling 2 for example).  The large size of
    struct inode reduces this advantage.
    
    With this patch the inode_cache slab goes from 640 bytes to 544 bytes, and
    the number that fits in a 4kB slab goes from 6 to 7 on ppc64.  A number of
    other inode slabs also see improvements.

    [PATCH] reduce size of struct dentry on 64bit
    
    Reduce size of struct dentry from 248 to 232 bytes on 64bit.
    
    - Reduce size of qstr by 8 bytes, placing int hash and int len together.
      We gain a further 4 byte saving when qstr is used in struct dentry
      since qstr goes from 24 to 16 bytes and the next member (d_lru)
      requires 8 byte alignment (which means 4 bytes of padding).
    
    - Move d_mounted to the end, since char d_iname[] only requires 1 byte
      alignment. This reduces struct dentry by another 4 bytes.
    
    With these changes the number of objects we can fit into a 4kB slab
    goes from 16 to 17 on ppc64.
    
    Note the above assumes the architecture naturally aligns types.

    [PATCH] libfs: move transaction file ops into libfs
    
    Below is an updated version of the patch which moves duplicated
    transaction-based file operation code into libfs.  Since the last post, the
    patch has been through a couple of iterations with Al, who suggested a
    number of cleanups including locking and interface simplification.
    
    For filesystem writers, the interface is now much simpler.  The
    simple_transaction_get() helper should be part of the file op write method.
     This safely obtains the transaction request data during write(), allocates
    a page for it and stores it there.  The data is returned to the caller for
    potential further processing, which then makes it available for the next
    read() call via simple_transaction_set().  See the selinuxfs and nfsctl
    code for examples of use.

    [PATCH] Use posix headers in sumversion.c
    
    When compiling Linux on Mac OSX I had trouble with scripts/sumversion.c.
    It includes <netinet/in.h> to obtain to definitions of htonl and ntohl.
    
    On Mac OSX these are found in <arpa/inet.h>.  After checking the POSIX
    specification it appears that this is the correct place to get the
    definitons for these functions.
    
    (http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/htonl.html)
    
    Using this header also appears to work on Linux (at least with
    Glibc-2.3.2).
    
    It seems clearer to me to go with the POSIX standard than implementing
    #if __APPLE__ style macros, but if such an approach is preferred I can
    supply patches for that instead.
    
    A patch against 2.6.7 which change <netinet/in.h> -> <arpa/inet.h> is

    [IPSEC]: Set TTL from route.
    
    Here is the promised patch that sets the TTL from the route parameter.
    I decided against adding an option to inherit the TTL like IPIP/GRE
    as I think that it doesn't really make sense with IPsec.  But it
    can be easily added later if someone needs it.
    
    This isn't completely right when nested tunnels are involved.  The
    TTL for intervening tunnels should be set from the routes to the
    intervening nodes.  But fixing that involves using information that
    isn't currently in the bundle.  I'll revisit this once the MTU stuff
    is fixed since that'll also involving adding the intervening routes
    to the bundle.

    [PATCH] hige2lowuid warning fixes
    
    fs/smbfs/inode.c: In function `smb_fill_super':
    fs/smbfs/inode.c:563: warning: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type
    
    Unfortunately, this patch uses the notorious "gcc warning suppression by
    obfuscation" technique.
    
    What seems to be going on is that the uid and gid convert macros in
    include/linux/highuid.h:
    
    #define __convert_uid(size, uid) \
            (size >= sizeof(uid) ? (uid) : high2lowuid(uid))
    
    only call high2lowuid in the case of trying to put a bigger (32 bit, say)
    uid/gid in a smaller (16 bit, in this case) word.  Gcc is smart enough to see
    that the comparison in high2lowuid() macro is silly if called with a 16 bit
    source uid, but not smart enough to understand from the __convert_uid() logic
    that this is exactly the case that high2lowuid() won't be called.
    
    So replace the logical "<" operator with the bit op "&~".  This obfuscates
    things enough to shut gcc up.
    
    Only build the half-dozen files that use SET_UID/SET_GID, on arch i386 and
    ia64.  Only the file fs/smbfs/inode.c showed the warning, both arch's, and
    this patch fixed both.  Untested further, past staring at the code long enough
    to convince myself the change has no actual affect on the code's results.

    [PATCH] hugetlb: permit executable mappings
    
    During the kernel summit, some discussion was had about the support
    requirements for a userspace program loader that loads executables into
    hugetlb on behalf of a major application (Oracle).  In order to support
    this in a robust fashion, the cleanup of the hugetlb must be robust in the
    presence of disorderly termination of the programs (e.g.  kill -9).  Hence,
    the cleanup semantics are those of System V shared memory, but Linux'
    System V shared memory needs one critical extension for this use:
    executability.
    
    The following microscopic patch enables this major application to provide
    robust hugetlb cleanup.

    Given the recent potential weaknesses in the SHA and MD families,

    So here is Whirlpool.  I chose it for a couple of reasons.
    
    o - It is by the same people who did Khazad. I feel pretty good about their work.
    o - It has been evaluated by NESSIE
      https://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/nessie/reports/phase1/sagwp3-037_1.pdf
    o - NESSIE has accepted it as one of the cryptographic primitives
    o - It will be part of an ISO standard in the revised ISO/IEC 10118-3:2003(E) standard, thanks to
    NESSIE
    o - It is patent free and has an implementation in the public domain.

    [PATCH] x86 PAE swapspace expansion
    
    PAE is artificially limited in terms of swapspace to the same bitsplit as
    ordinary i386, a 5/24 split (32 swapfiles, 64GB max swapfile size), when a
    5/27 split (32 swapfiles, 512GB max swapfile size) is feasible.  This patch
    transparently removes that limitation by using more of the space available
    in PAE's wider ptes for swap ptes.
    
    While this is obviously not likely to be used directly, it is important
    from the standpoint of strict non-overcommit, where the swapspace must be
    potentially usable in order to be reserved for non-overcommit.  There are
    workloads with Committed_AS of over 256GB on ia32 PAE wanting strict
    non-overcommit to prevent being OOM killed.

    [PATCH] kill CLONE_IDLETASK
    
      The sole remaining usage of CLONE_IDLETASK is to determine whether pid
      allocation should be performed in copy_process().  This patch eliminates
      that last branch on CLONE_IDLETASK in the normal process creation path,
      removes the masking of CLONE_IDLETASK from clone_flags as it's now ignored
      under all circumstances, and furthermore eliminates the symbol
      CLONE_IDLETASK entirely.
    
    From: William Lee Irwin III <wli@holomorphy.com>
    
      Fix the fork-idle consolidation.  During that consolidation, the generic
      code was made to pass a pointer to on-stack pt_regs that had been memset()
      to 0.  ia64, however, requires a NULL pt_regs pointer argument and
      dispatches on that in its copy_thread() function to do SMP
      trampoline-specific RSE -related setup.  Passing pointers to zeroed pt_regs
      resulted in SMP wakeup -time deadlocks and exceptions.

    [PATCH] sched: consolidate CLONE_IDLETASK masking
    
    Every arch now bears the burden of sanitizing CLONE_IDLETASK out of the
    clone_flags passed to do_fork() by userspace.  This patch hoists the
    masking of CLONE_IDLETASK out of the system call entrypoints into
    do_fork(), and thereby removes some small overheads from do_fork(), as
    do_fork() may now assume that CLONE_IDLETASK has been cleared.

    [PATCH] improve speed of freeing bootmem
    
    Attached is a patch that greatly improves the speed of freeing boot memory.
     On ia64 machines with 2GB or more memory (I didn't test with less, but I
    can't imagine there being a problem), the speed improvement is about 75%
    for the function free_all_bootmem_core.  This translates to savings on the
    order of 1 minute / TB of memory during boot time.  That number comes from
    testing on a machine with 512GB, and extrapolating based on profiling of an
    unpatched 4TB machine.  For 4 and 8 TB machines, the time spent in this
    function is about 1 minutes/TB, which is painful especially given that
    there is no indication of what is going on put to the console (this issue
    to possibly be addressed later).
    
    The basic idea is to free higher order pages instead of going through every
    single one.  Also, some unnecessary atomic operations are done away with
    and replaced with non-atomic equivalents, and prefetching is done where it
    helps the most.  For a more in-depth discusion of this patch, please see
    the linux-ia64 archives (topic is "free bootmem feedback patch").
    
    The patch is originally Tony Luck's, and I added some further optimizations
    (non-atomic ops improvements and prefetching).

    [PATCH] Fix mpage_readpage() for big requests
    
    The problem is, if we increase our readhead size arbitrarily (say 2M), we

    [PATCH] vm: alloc_pages watermark fixes
    
    Previously the ->protection[] logic was broken.  It was difficult to follow
    and basically didn't use the asynch reclaim watermarks (pages_min,
    pages_low, pages_high) properly.
    
    Now use ->protection *only* for lower-zone protection.  So the allocator
    now explicitly uses the ->pages_low, ->pages_min watermarks and adds
    ->protection on top of that, instead of trying to use ->protection for
    everything.
    
    Pages are allocated down to (->pages_low + ->protection), once this is
    reached, kswapd the background reclaim is started; after this, we can
    allocate down to (->pages_min + ->protection) without blocking; the memory
    below pages_min is reserved for __GFP_HIGH and PF_MEMALLOC allocations.
    kswapd attempts to reclaim memory until ->pages_high is reached.

    [PATCH] x86 bitops.h commentary on instruction reordering
    
    Back when we were discussing the need for a memory barrier in sync_page(),
    it came to me (thanks Andrea!) that the bit operations can be perfectly
    reordered on architectures other than x86.
    
    I think the commentary on i386 bitops.h is misleading, its worth to note
    that that these operations are not guaranteed not to be reordered on
    different architectures.
    
    clear_bit() already does that:
    
     * clear_bit() is atomic and may not be reordered.  However, it does
     * not contain a memory barrier, so if it is used for locking purposes,
     * you should call smp_mb__before_clear_bit() and/or smp_mb__after_clear_bit()
     * in order to ensure changes are visible on other processors.

    [PATCH] rmaplock: swapoff use anon_vma
    
    Swapoff can make good use of a page's anon_vma and index, while it's still
    left in swapcache, or once it's brought back in and the first pte mapped back:
    unuse_vma go directly to just one page of only those vmas with the same
    anon_vma.  And unuse_process can skip any vmas without an anon_vma (extending
    the hugetlb check: hugetlb vmas have no anon_vma).
    
    This just hacks in on top of the existing procedure, still going through all
    the vmas of all the mms in mmlist.  A more elegant procedure might replace
    mmlist by a list of anon_vmas: but that would be more work to implement, with
    apparently more overhead in the common paths.

    [PATCH] rmaplock: mm lock ordering
    
    With page_map_lock out of the way, there's no need for page_referenced and
    try_to_unmap to use trylocks - provided we switch anon_vma->lock and
    mm->page_table_lock around in anon_vma_prepare.  Though I suppose it's
    possible that we'll find that vmscan makes better progress with trylocks than
    spinning - we're free to choose trylocks again if so.
    
    Try to update the mm lock ordering documentation in filemap.c.  But I still
    find it confusing, and I've no idea of where to stop.  So add an mm lock
    ordering list I can understand to rmap.c.

    [PATCH] rmaplock: SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU
    
    With page_map_lock gone, how to stabilize page->mapping's anon_vma while
    acquiring anon_vma->lock in page_referenced_anon and try_to_unmap_anon?
    
    The page cannot actually be freed (vmscan holds reference), but however much
    we check page_mapped (which guarantees that anon_vma is in use - or would
    guarantee that if we added suitable barriers), there's no locking against page
    becoming unmapped the instant after, then anon_vma freed.
    
    It's okay to take anon_vma->lock after it's freed, so long as it remains a
    struct anon_vma (its list would become empty, or perhaps reused for an
    unrelated anon_vma: but no problem since we always check that the page located
    is the right one); but corruption if that memory gets reused for some other
    purpose.
    
    This is not unique: it's liable to be problem whenever the kernel tries to
    approach a structure obliquely.  It's generally solved with an atomic
    reference count; but one advantage of anon_vma over anonmm is that it does not
    have such a count, and it would be a backward step to add one.
    
    Therefore...  implement SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU flag, to guarantee that such a
    kmem_cache_alloc'ed structure cannot get freed to other use while the
    rcu_read_lock is held i.e.  preempt disabled; and use that for anon_vma.
    
    Fix concerns raised by Manfred: this flag is incompatible with poisoning and
    destructor, and kmem_cache_destroy needs to synchronize_kernel.
    
    I hope SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU may be useful elsewhere; but though it's safe for
    little anon_vma, I'd be reluctant to use it on any caches whose immediate
    shrinkage under pressure is important to the system.

    [PATCH] rmaplock: kill page_map_lock
    
    The pte_chains rmap used pte_chain_lock (bit_spin_lock on PG_chainlock) to
    lock its pte_chains.  We kept this (as page_map_lock: bit_spin_lock on
    PG_maplock) when we moved to objrmap.  But the file objrmap locks its vma tree
    with mapping->i_mmap_lock, and the anon objrmap locks its vma list with
    anon_vma->lock: so isn't the page_map_lock superfluous?
    
    Pretty much, yes.  The mapcount was protected by it, and needs to become an
    atomic: starting at -1 like page _count, so nr_mapped can be tracked precisely
    up and down.  The last page_remove_rmap can't clear anon page mapping any
    more, because of races with page_add_rmap; from which some BUG_ONs must go for
    the same reason, but they've served their purpose.
    
    vmscan decisions are naturally racy, little change there beyond removing
    page_map_lock/unlock.  But to stabilize the file-backed page->mapping against
    truncation while acquiring i_mmap_lock, page_referenced_file now needs page
    lock to be held even for refill_inactive_zone.  There's a similar issue in
    acquiring anon_vma->lock, where page lock doesn't help: which this patch
    pretends to handle, but actually it needs the next.
    
    Roughly 10% cut off lmbench fork numbers on my 2*HT*P4.  Must confess my
    testing failed to show the races even while they were knowingly exposed: would
    benefit from testing on racier equipment.

    [PATCH] rmaplock: PageAnon in mapping
    
    First of a batch of five patches to eliminate rmap's page_map_lock, replace
    its trylocking by spinlocking, and use anon_vma to speed up swapoff.
    
    Patches updated from the originals against 2.6.7-mm7: nothing new so I won't
    spam the list, but including Manfred's SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU fixes, and omitting
    the unuse_process mmap_sem fix already in 2.6.8-rc3.
    
    
    This patch:
    
    Replace the PG_anon page->flags bit by setting the lower bit of the pointer in
    page->mapping when it's anon_vma: PAGE_MAPPING_ANON bit.
    
    We're about to eliminate the locking which kept the flags and mapping in
    synch: it's much easier to work on a local copy of page->mapping, than worry
    about whether flags and mapping are in synch (though I imagine it could be
    done, at greater cost, with some barriers).

    was required for installations on IBM mainframe (s390), which doesn't have
    a good way to pass arguments.
    
    There are a number of reasonable situations that go past the current limits
    of 8.  One that comes to mind is when you want to perform a manual vnc
    install on a headless machine using anaconda.  This requires passing in a
    number of parameters to get anaconda past the initial (no-gui) loader
    screens.

    [PATCH] AIO: workqueue context switch reduction
    
    From: Chris Mason
    
    I compared the 2.6 pipetest results with the 2.4 suse kernel, and 2.6 was
    roughly 40% slower.  During the pipetest run, 2.6 generates ~600,000
    context switches per second while 2.4 generates 30 or so.
    
    aio-context-switch (attached) has a few changes that reduces our context
    switch rate, and bring performance back up to 2.4 levels.  These have only
    really been tested against pipetest, they might make other workloads worse.
    
    The basic theory behind the patch is that it is better for the userland
    process to call run_iocbs than it is to schedule away and let the worker
    thread do it.
    
    
    1) on io_submit, use run_iocbs instead of run_iocb
    2) on io_getevents, call run_iocbs if no events were available.
    
    3) don't let two procs call run_iocbs for the same context at the same
       time.  They just end up bouncing on spinlocks.
    
    The first three optimizations got me down to 360,000 context switches per
    second, and they help build a little structure to allow optimization #4,
    which uses queue_delayed_work(HZ/10) instead of queue_work.
    
    That brings down the number of context switches to 2.4 levels.
    
    Adds aio_run_all_iocbs so that normal processes can run all the pending
    retries on the run list.  This allows worker threads to keep using list
    splicing, but regular procs get to run the list until it stays empty.  The
    end result should be less work for the worker threads.
    
    I was able to trigger short stalls (1sec) with aio-stress, and with the
    current patch they are gone.  Could be wishful thinking on my part though,
    please let me know how this works for you.

    [PATCH] AIO: Splice runlist for fairness across io contexts
    
    This patch tries be a little fairer across multiple io contexts in handling
    retries, helping make sure progress happens uniformly across different io
    contexts (especially if they are acting on independent queues).
    
    It splices the ioctx runlist before processing it in __aio_run_iocbs.  If
    new iocbs get added to the ctx in meantime, it queues a fresh workqueue
    entry instead of handling them righaway, so that other ioctxs' retries get
    a chance to be processed before the newer entries in the queue.
    
    This might make a difference in a situation where retries are getting
    queued very fast on one ioctx, while the workqueue entry for another ioctx
    is stuck behind it.  I've only seen this occasionally earlier and can't
    recreate it consistently, but may be worth including anyway.

    [PATCH] AIO: retry infrastructure fixes and enhancements
    
    From: Daniel McNeil <daniel@osdl.org>
    From: Chris Mason <mason@suse.com>
    
     AIO: retry infrastructure fixes and enhancements
    
     Reorganises, comments and fixes the AIO retry logic. Fixes
     and enhancements include:
    
       - Split iocb setup and execution in io_submit
            (also fixes io_submit error reporting)
       - Use aio workqueue instead of keventd for retries
       - Default high level retry methods
       - Subtle use_mm/unuse_mm fix
       - Code commenting
       - Fix aio process hang on EINVAL (Daniel McNeil)
       - Hold the context lock across unuse_mm
       - Acquire task_lock in use_mm()
       - Allow fops to override the retry method with their own
       - Elevated ref count for AIO retries (Daniel McNeil)
       - set_fs needed when calling use_mm
       - Flush workqueue on __put_ioctx (Chris Mason)
       - Fix io_cancel to work with retries (Chris Mason)
       - Read-immediate option for socket/pipe retry support
    
     Note on default high-level retry methods support
     ================================================
    
     High-level retry methods allows an AIO request to be executed as a series of
     non-blocking iterations, where each iteration retries the remaining part of
     the request from where the last iteration left off, by reissuing the
     corresponding AIO fop routine with modified arguments representing the
     remaining I/O.  The retries are "kicked" via the AIO waitqueue callback
     aio_wake_function() which replaces the default wait queue entry used for
     blocking waits.
    
     The high level retry infrastructure is responsible for running the
     iterations in the mm context (address space) of the caller, and ensures that
     only one retry instance is active at a given time, thus relieving the fops
     themselves from having to deal with potential races of that sort.

    [PATCH] don't pass mem_map into init functions
    
      When using CONFIG_NONLINEAR, a zone's mem_map isn't contiguous, and isn't
      allocated in the same place.  This means that nonlinear doesn't really have
      a mem_map[] to pass into free_area_init_node() or memmap_init_zone() which
      makes any sense.
    
      So, this patch removes the 'struct page *mem_map' argument to both of
      those functions.  All non-NUMA architectures just pass a NULL in there,
      which is ignored.  The solution on the NUMA arches is to pass the mem_map in
      via the pgdat, which works just fine.
    
      To replace the removed arguments, a call to pfn_to_page(node_start_pfn) is
      made.  This is valid because all of the pfn_to_page() implementations rely
      only on the pgdats, which are already set up at this time.  Plus, the
      pfn_to_page() method should work for any future nonlinear-type code.
    
      Finally, the patch creates a function: node_alloc_mem_map(), which I plan
      to effectively #ifdef out for nonlinear at some future date.
    
      Compile tested and booted on SMP x86, NUMAQ, and ppc64.

      x86-64 wouldn't compile with NUMA support on, as node_alloc_mem_map()

      patch wraps that reference in such an #ifdef.

    [PATCH] New x86-64 merge
    
    This fixes various issues in the previous update, in particular
    a kernel without CONFIG_GART_IOMMU should boot now again,
    
    The kernel discoverys PCI BUS<->CPU affinity on AMD systems
    now.  It is so far used by dma_alloc_coherent to allocate memory
    Experimental patches to add this to sysfs exist, but they're not
    included yet. On systems with no memory on a CPU this information may
    be wrong.
    
    It has a new experimental CONFIG_UNORDERED_IO option. When enabled
    it uses write combining for stores to device iomemory mapping. This
    may give better performance with some device drivers, but has a slight
    risk of breaking drivers (in general if a driver works on ia64,ppc64,sparc64
    it should also work). Based on some discussions with Grant Grundler.
    
    It requires the driver to use memory barriers properly. I would be interested
    in feedback on any performance changes you're seeing. For a production system I
    would recommend to keep it turned off(although I run it on all my systems and
    haven't run into any problems yet)
    
    ACPI and Centrino speedstep is enabled now for Nocona systems.
    
    The IOMMU code does lazy merging by default now, which should be safe
    and may increase performance on block IO.  It also avoids SAC force by default
    now.
    
    The machine check code has been improved again, hopefully it is good
    now. It will log now machine check events from before the last reset.
    And various other fixes.
    
    The x86-64 parts are now gcc 3.5 clean.

    the loops-per-jiffy value.  This shaves up to a quarter of a second off
    boot times, which are critical for embedded appliances.
    
    It's a bit thin, but the code is in __init.

    better performance).  Here, instead, the OOM case is handled on its own, so if

    [PATCH] uml: Avoids a panic for a legal situation
    
    From: Alex Züpke <azu@sysgo.de>, and me
    
    SKAS mode is like 4G/4G (here we have actually 3G/3G) for guest processes, so
    when checking for kernel stack overflow, we must first make sure we are
    checking a kernel-space address.  Also, correctly test for stack overflows
    (i.e.  check if there is less than 1k of stack left; see
    arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:do_IRQ()).  And also, THREAD_SIZE != PAGE_SIZE * 2, in
    general (though this setting is almost never changed, so we didn't notice
    this1).  Thanks to the good eye of Alex Züpke <azu@sysgo.de> for first seeing
    this bug, and providing a test program:

    [PATCH] uml: Fixes "fixdep.c" to support arch/um/include/uml-config.h.
    
    You probably saw that if you change one config option, even if
    linux/autoconf.h (which is included by everything) changes, the kernel is
    smart enough not to recompile everything.  But with UML this no more holds.
    Why?  Because, as you see in this patch, fixdep avoids making anything depend
    onto linux/autoconf.h *explicitly*, but nobody taught him to do the same for
    arch/um/include/uml-config.h.  So apply this patch.  Do not say "I don't want
    to change the generic Kbuild for one arch": this cannot hurt.  It's a bugfix
    for us, a no-op for others.
    
    Note: with this patch, fixdep will still add a dependency from a file
    containing UML_CONFIG_BYE onto CONFIG_BYE.  Since someone could think that
    fixdep should grep for [^A-Z_]CONFIG_ rather than simply for CONFIG_, I've
    added a comment that ask *not to fix* this "bug".

    [PATCH] uml: Fixes an host fd leak caused by hostfs.
    
    In detail, on 2.4 we used force_delete() to make sure inode were not cached,
    and we then close the host file when the inode is cleared; when porting to 2.6
    the "force_delete" thing was dropped, and this patch adds a fix for this (by
    setting drop_inode = generic_delete_inode).  Search for drop_inode in the 2.6
    Documentation/filesystems/vfs.txt for info about this.

    [PATCH] i386 virtual memory layout rework
    
      Rework the i386 mm layout to allow applications to allocate more virtual
      memory, and larger contiguous chunks.
    
    
      - the patch is compatible with existing architectures that either make
        use of HAVE_ARCH_UNMAPPED_AREA or use the default mmap() allocator - there
        is no change in behavior.
    
      - 64-bit architectures can use the same mechanism to clean up 32-bit
        compatibility layouts: by defining HAVE_ARCH_PICK_MMAP_LAYOUT and
        providing a arch_pick_mmap_layout() function - which can then decide
        between various mmap() layout functions.
    
      - I also introduced a new personality bit (ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT) to signal
        older binaries that dont have PT_GNU_STACK.  x86 uses this to revert back
        to the stock layout.  I also changed x86 to not clear the personality bits
        upon exec(), like x86-64 already does.
    
      - once every architecture that uses HAVE_ARCH_UNMAPPED_AREA has defined
        its arch_pick_mmap_layout() function, we can get rid of
        HAVE_ARCH_UNMAPPED_AREA altogether, as a final cleanup.
    
      the new layout generation function (__get_unmapped_area()) got significant
      testing in FC1/2, so i'm pretty confident it's robust.
    
    
      Compiles & boots fine on an 'old' and on a 'new' x86 distro as well.
    
      The two known breakages were:
    
         http://www.redhatconfig.com/msg/67248.html
    
         [ 'cyzload' third-party utility broke. ]
    
         http://www.zipworld.com/au/~akpm/dde.tar.gz
    
         [ your editor broke :-) ]
    
      both were caused by application bugs that did:
    
    	int ret = malloc();
    
    	if (ret <= 0)
    		failure;
    
      such bugs are easy to spot if they happen, and if it happens it's possible
      to work it around immediately without having to change the binary, via the
      setarch patch.
    
      No other application has been found to be affected, and this particular
      change got pretty wide coverage already over RHEL3 and exec-shield, it's in
      use for more than a year.
    
    
      The setarch utility can be used to trigger the compatibility layout on
      x86, the following version has been patched to take the `-L' option:
    
     	http://people.redhat.com/mingo/flexible-mmap/setarch-1.4-2.tar.gz
    
      "setarch -L i386 <command>" will run the command with the old layout.
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
      The problem is in the flexible mmap patch: arch_get_unmapped_area_topdown
      is liable to give your mmap vm_start above TASK_SIZE with vm_end wrapped;
      which is confusing, and ends up as that BUG_ON(mm->map_count).
    
      The patch below stops that behaviour, but it's not the full solution:
      wilson_mmap_test -s 1000 then simply cannot allocate memory for the large
      mmap, whereas it works fine non-top-down.
    
      I think it's wrong to interpret a large or rlim_infinite stack rlimit as
      an inviolable request to reserve that much for the stack: it makes much less
      VM available than bottom up, not what was intended.  Perhaps top down should
      go bottom up (instead of belly up) when it fails - but I'd probably better
      leave that to Ingo.
    
      Or perhaps the default should place stack below text (as WLI suggested and
      ELF intended, with its text defaulting to 0x08048000, small progs sharing
      page table between stack and text and data); with a further personality for
      those needing bigger stack.
    
    From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
    
      - fall back to the bottom-up layout if the stack can grow unlimited (if
      the stack ulimit has been set to RLIM_INFINITY)
    
      - try the bottom-up allocator if the top-down allocator fails - this can
      utilize the hole between the true bottom of the stack and its ulimit, as a
      last-resort effort.

    [PATCH] sched: smt fixes
    
    while looking at HT scheduler bugreports and boot failures i discovered a
    bad assumption in most of the HT scheduling code: that resched_task() can
    be called without holding the task's runqueue.
    
    This is most definitely not valid - doing it without locking can lead to
    the task on that CPU exiting, and this CPU corrupting the (ex-) task_info
    struct.  It can also lead to HT-wakeup races with task switching on that
    other CPU.  (this_CPU marking the wrong task on that_CPU as need_resched -
    resulting in e.g.  idle wakeups not working.)
    
    The attached patch against fixes it all up. Changes:
    
    - resched_task() needs to touch the task so the runqueue lock of that CPU
      must be held: resched_task() now enforces this rule.
    
    - wake_priority_sleeper() was called without holding the runqueue lock.
    
    - wake_sleeping_dependent() needs to hold the runqueue locks of all
      siblings (2 typically).  Effects of this ripples back to schedule() as
      well - in the non-SMT case it gets compiled out so it's fine.
    
    - dependent_sleeper() needs the runqueue locks too - and it's slightly
      harder because it wants to know the 'next task' info which might change
      during the lock-drop/reacquire.  Ripple effect on schedule() => compiled
      out on non-SMT so fine.
    
    - resched_task() was disabling preemption for no good reason - all paths
      that called this function had either a spinlock held or irqs disabled.
    
    Compiled & booted on x86 SMP and UP, with and without SMT. Booted the
    SMT kernel on a real SMP+HT box as well. (Unpatched kernel wouldn't even
    boot with the resched_task() assert in place.)

    this is a property of the base scheduler as well.

    [PATCH] scheduler statistics
    
    It adds lots of CPU scheduler stats in /proc/pid/stat.  They are described in
    the new Documentation//sched-stats.txt
    
    We were carrying this patch offline for some time, but as there's still
    considerable ongoing work in this area, and as the new stats are a
    configuration option, I think it's best that this capability be in the base
    kernel.
    
    Nick removed a fair amount of statistics that he wasn't using.  The full patch
    gathers more information.  In particular, his patch doesn't include the code
    to measure the latency between the time a process is made runnable and the
    time it hits a processor which will be key to measuring interactivity changes.
    
    He passed his changes back to me and I got finished merging his changes with
    the current statistics patches just before OLS.  I believe this is largely a
    superset of the patch you grabbed and should port relatively easily too.
    
    Versions also exist for
    
        2.6.8-rc2

    The version below is for 2.6.8-rc2-mm2 without the staircase code and has
    been compiled cleanly but not yet run.
    
    From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
    
    this code needs a couple of cleanups before it can go into mainline:
    
    fs/proc/array.c, fs/proc/base.c, fs/proc/proc_misc.c:
    
     - moved the new /proc/<PID>/stat fields to /proc/<PID>/schedstat,
       because the new fields break older procps. It's cleaner this way
       anyway. This moving of fields necessiated a bump to version 10.
    
    Documentation/sched-stats.txt:
    
     - updated sched-stats.txt for version 10
    
     - wake_up_forked_thread() => wake_up_new_task()
    
     - updated the per-process field description
    
    Kconfig:
    
     - removed the default y and made the option dependent on DEBUG_KERNEL.
       This is really for scheduler analysis, normal users dont need the
       overhead.
    
    include/linux/sched.h:
    
     - moved the definitions into kernel/sched.c - this fixes UP compilation

     - also moved the sched-domain definitions to sched.c - now that the
       sched-domains internals are not exposed to architectures this is
       doable. It's also necessary due to the previous change.
    
    kernel/fork.c:
    
     - moved the ->sched_info init to sched_fork() where it belongs.
    
    kernel/sched.c:
    
     - wake_up_forked_thread() -> wake_up_new_task(), wuft_cnt -> wunt_cnt,
       wuft_moved -> wunt_moved.
    
     - wunt_cnt and wunt_moved were defined by never updated - added the
       missing code to wake_up_new_task().
    
     - whitespace/style police
    
     - removed whitespace changes done to code not related to schedstats -
       i'll send a separate patch for these (and more).

    [PATCH] sched: adjust p4 per-cpu gain
    
    The smt-nice handling is a little too aggressive by not estimating the per cpu
    gain as high enough for pentium4 hyperthread.  This patch changes the per
    sibling cpu gain from 15% to 25%.  The true per cpu gain is entirely dependant
    on the workload but overall the 2 species of Pentium4 that support
    hyperthreading have about 20-30% gain.
    
    P.S: Anton - For the power processors that are now using this SMT nice
    infrastructure it would be worth setting this value separately at 40%.

    [PATCH] Create cpu_sibling_map for PPC64
    
    In light of some proposed changes in the sched_domains code, I coded up
    this little ditty that simply creates and populates a cpu_sibling_map for
    PPC64 machines.  The patch just checks the CPU flags to determine if the
    CPU supports SMT (aka Hyper-Threading aka Multi-Threading aka ...) and
    fills in a mask of the siblings for each CPU in the system.  This should
    allow us to build sched_domains for PPC64 with generic code in
    kernel/sched.c for the SMT systems.  SMT is becoming more popular and is
    turning up in more and more architectures.  I don't think it will be too
    long until this feature is supported by most arches...

    of the new arch_init_sched_domain code).  This patch also contains the 2
    line fix to remove the check of first_cpu(sd->groups->cpumask)) that Jesse
    sent in earlier.

    [PATCH] sched: limit cpuspan of node scheduler domains
    
      This patch limits the cpu span of each node's scheduler domain to prevent
      balancing across too many cpus.  The cpus included in a node's domain are
      determined by the SD_NODES_PER_DOMAIN define and the arch specific
      sched_domain_node_span routine if ARCH_HAS_SCHED_DOMAIN is defined.  If
      ARCH_HAS_SCHED_DOMAIN is not defined, behavior is unchanged--all possible
      cpus will be included in each node's scheduling domain.  Currently, only
      ia64 provides an arch specific sched_domain_node_span routine.
    
    From: Jesse Barnes <jbarnes@engr.sgi.com>
    
      This patch adds some more NUMA specific logic to the creation of scheduler
      domains.  Domains spanning all CPUs in a large system are too large to
      schedule across efficiently, leading to livelocks and inordinate amounts of
      time being spent in scheduler routines.  With this patch applied, the node
      scheduling domains for NUMA platforms will only contain a specified number
      of nearby CPUs, based on the value of SD_NODES_PER_DOMAIN.  It also allows
      arches to override SD_NODE_INIT, which sets the domain scheduling parameters
      for each node's domain.  This is necessary especially for large systems.
    
      Possible future directions:
    
      o multilevel node hierarchy (e.g.  node domains could contain 4 nodes
        worth of CPUs, supernode domains could contain 32 nodes worth, etc.  each
        with their own SD_NODE_INIT values)
    
      o more tweaking of SD_NODE_INIT values for good load balancing vs.
        overhead tradeoffs

    [PATCH] sched: consolidate sched domains
    
      Teach the generic domains builder about SMT, and consolidate all
      architecture specific domain code into that.  Also, the SD_*_INIT macros can
      now be redefined by arch code without duplicating the entire setup code.
      This can be done by defining ARCH_HASH_SCHED_TUNE.
    
      The generic builder has been simplified with the addition of a helper
      macro which will probably prove to be useful to arch specific code as well
      and should be exported if that is the case.

    [PATCH] sched: cleanup, improve sched <=> fork APIs
    
    Move balancing and child-runs-first logic from fork.c into sched.c where
    it belongs.
    
    * Consolidate wake_up_forked_process and wake_up_forked_thread into
      wake_up_new_process, and pass in clone_flags as suggested by Linus.  This
      removes a lot of code duplication and allows all logic to be handled in that
      function.
    
    * Don't do balance-on-clone balancing for vfork'ed threads.
    
    * Don't do set_task_cpu or balance one clone in wake_up_new_process.
      Instead do it in sched_fork to fix set_cpus_allowed races.
    
    * Don't do child-runs-first for CLONE_VM processes, as there is obviously no
      COW benifit to be had.  This is a big one, it enables Andi's workload to run
      well without clone balancing, because the OpenMP child threads can get
      balanced off to other nodes *before* they start running and allocating
      memory.
    
    * Rename sched_balance_exec to sched_exec: hide the policy from the API.

    [PATCH] sched: fix timeslice calculations for HZ=1000.
    
    The main benefit is that with the default HZ=1000 nice +19 tasks now get 5
    msecs of timeslices, so the ratio of CPU use is linear.  (nice 0 task gets
    20 times more CPU time than a nice 19 task.  Prior this change the ratio
    was 1:10)
    
    another effect is that nice 0 tasks now get a round 100 msecs of timeslices
    (as intended), instead of 102 msecs.
    
    here's a table of old/new timeslice values, for HZ=1000 and 100:
    
                          HZ=1000         (   HZ=100   )
                        old    new        ( old    new )
    
            nice -20:   200    200        ( 200    200 )
            nice -19:   195    195        ( 190    190 )
            ...
            nice 0:     102    100        ( 100    100 )
            nice 1:      97     95        (  90     90 )
            nice 2:      92     90        (  90     90 )
            ...
            nice 17:     19     15        (  10     10 )

    printed in this situation more informative.  Additionaly, the rtas_call
    was changed to rtas_set_indicator so as to avoid having to handle
    RTAS_BUSY returns.

    Use F_SETLK instead of F_SETLK64 in nfs locking code.
    
    The code doesn't actually _care_ about 32/64-bit issues,
    only about F_SETLK vs F_SETLKW, and the F_SETLK64 doesn't
    exist except as a compatibility thing on 64-bit architectures
    (since the regular one already _is_ 64-bit, of course).

    NFSv2: In the NFSv3 RFC, the sattr3 structure passed in the SETATTR
       call allows for the client to request that the mtime and/or atime
       of an inode be set to the current server time, the given (client)
       time, or not changed.  The set-to-current-server value is used
       when you run "touch file" on the client.
    
    The NFSv2 RFC defines no such encoding for the sattr structure.
       However Solaris and Irix machine obey a convention where passing
       the invalid value mtime.useconds=1000000 means "set both mtime and
       atime to the current server time".  The convention is documented
       in the book "NFS Illustrated" by Brent Callaghan.  The patch below
       implements this convention for the Linux client and server (hence
       multiple To:s).

    NFS: In 2.4, NFS O_DIRECT used the VFS's O_DIRECT logic to provide
       direct I/O support for NFS files.  The 2.4 VFS O_DIRECT logic was
       block based, thus the NFS client had to provide a minimum
       allowable blocksize for O_DIRECT reads and writes on NFS files.
       For various reasons we chose 512 bytes. In 2.6, there is no
       requirement for a minimum blocksize.  NFS O_DIRECT reads and
       writes can go to any byte at any offset in a file.  Thus we revert
       the blocksize setting for NFS file systems to the previous
       behavior, which was to advertise the "wsize" setting as the
       optimal I/O block size.  This improves the performance of
       applications like 'cp' which use this value as their transfer
       size.
    
    This patch also exposes the server's reported disk block size in the
       f_frsize of the vfsstat structure.

    NFSv4: ask the server to send us more readdir records per RPC call.
       Currently we are wasting considerable amounts of space in the page

    RPC: Reduce stack utilization for all synchronous NFS operations by
       using a dynamically allocated rpc_task structure instead of
       allocating one on the stack.  This reduces stack utilization by
       over 200 bytes for all synchronous NFS operations.

    [PATCH] increase per-user mlock limit default to 32k
    
    Since various gnupg users have indicated that gpg wants to mlock 32kB of
    memory, I created the patch below that increases the default mlock ulimit
    to 32kB.
    
    This is no security problem because it's trivial for processes to lock way
    more memory than this in page tables, network buffers, etc.  In fact, since
    this patch allows gnupg to mlock to prevent passphrase data from being
    swapped out, the security people will probably like it ;)
    
    This gets the new per-user mlock limit a bit more testing, too.

    [PATCH] rlimit-based mlocks for unprivileged users
    
    Here is the last agreed-on patch that lets normal users mlock pages up to
    their rlimit.  This patch addresses all the issues brought up by Chris and
    Andrea.
    
    From: Chris Wright <chrisw@osdl.org>
    
    Couple more nits.
    
    The default lockable amount is one page now (first patch is was 0).  Why
    don't we keep it as 0, with the CAP_IPC_LOCK overrides in place?  That way
    nothing is changed from user perspective, and the rest of the policy can be
    done by userspace as it should.
    
    This patch breaks in one scenario.  When ulimit == 0, process has
    CAP_IPC_LOCK, and does SHM_LOCK.  The subsequent unlock or destroy will
    corrupt the locked_shm count.
    
    It's also inconsistent in handling user_can_mlock/CAP_IPC_LOCK interaction
    betwen shm_lock and shm_hugetlb.
    
    SHM_HUGETLB can now only be done by the shm_group or CAP_IPC_LOCK.
    Not any can_do_mlock() user.
    
    Double check of can_do_mlock isn't needed in SHM_LOCK path.
    
    Interface names user_can_mlock and user_substract_mlock could be better.
    
    Incremental update below.  Ran some simple sanity tests on this plus my
    patch below and didn't find any problems.
    
    * Make default RLIM_MEMLOCK limit 0.
    * Move CAP_IPC_LOCK check into user_can_mlock to be consistent
      and fix but with ulimit == 0 && CAP_IPC_LOCK with SHM_LOCK.
    * Allow can_do_mlock() user to try SHM_HUGETLB setup.
    * Remove unecessary extra can_do_mlock() test in shmem_lock().
    * Rename user_can_mlock to user_shm_lock and user_subtract_mlock
      to user_shm_unlock.
    * Use user instead of current->user to fit in 80 cols on SHM_LOCK.

    [PATCH] readahead fixes
    
    Here is a consolidated readahead patch that takes care of the performance
    regression seen with multiple threaded writes to the same file descriptor.
    
    
    	The patch does the following:
    
    	1. Instead of calculating the average count of sequential
    		access in the read patterns, it calculates the
    		average amount of hits in the current window.
    	2. This average is used to guide the size of the next current
    		window.
    	3. Since the field serial_cnt in the ra structure does not
    	 	make sense with the introduction of the new logic,
    		I have renamed that field as currnt_wnd_hit.
    
    This patch will help the read patterns that are not neccessarily sequential
    but have sufficient locality.  However it may regress random workload.
    
    	Results:
    
    	1. Berkley Shands has reported great performance with this
    		patch.
    	2. iozone showed negligible effect on various read patterns.
    	3. DSS workload saw neglible change.
    	4. Sysbench saw a small improvement.

    Ok I have enclosed the results for the recent readahead fixes.  The summary
    is: there is no significant improvement or decrease in performance of (DSS
    workload, iozone, sysbench) The increase or decrease is in the margin of
    errors.
    
    I have enclosed a patch that partially backs off Miklos's fix.  Shane
    Shrybman correctly pointed out that the real fix is to set ra->average
    value to max/2 when we move from readahead-off mode to readahead-on mode.
    The other part of Miklos's fix becomes irrelevent.

    [PATCH] aio.c: rename 'struct timeout' to 'struct aio_timeout'
    
    This patch renames fs/aio.c:'struct timeout' to 'struct aio_timeout'.  The
    rationale behind this decision is this type is used only inside the
    aforementioned aio.c file and being the type name very generic, it is
    likely to cause namespace conflicts in the future.
    
    I actually found it while working on an extended schedule_timeout()- like
    API used by robust mutexes but usable by anyone.  There I declared a
    'struct timeout' and aio.c complained about it.  I could have also renamed
    the struct for the schedule_timeout() like API, but being the aio.c one
    specific to the file, I thought it might make more sense to rename the
    later.

    [PATCH] DIO pages-in-io accounting fix
    
    I found one more accounting inconsistency with dio_pages_in_io.  This is a
    day-one bug and I started hitting it on latest -mm due to the recent
    changes to dio_pages_in_io calculations to be exact.
    
    If the file is badly fragmented (no contiguous blocks at all), and the user
    buffer is not page aligned - we need to create IO for each disk block with
    2 pages.  (bio with 2 vecs).
    
    dio_bio_add_page() should not decrement dio_pages_in_io for every add page.
     It should only decrement, it only if its done with that page and moving on
    to next page.  (since dio_pages_in_io represent how many actual pages we
    are operating on).
    
    Here is the patch to fix this accounting.  Without this patch, we will hit
    BUG() in dio_new_bio() with O_DIRECT on filesystems.

    [PATCH] IPMI driver updates
    
    Some people found some bugs and some missing functions in the IPMI driver,
    so I have patching things together for the next release.  The attached
    patch moves to version 33 of the driver and contains:
    
    * SMBIOS table support for specifying register spacing.  This allows
      non-contiguous registers to be specified and some machines do
      this.
    * ACPI table updates to support all the possible register sizes and
      bit offsets into the registers for the IPMI information.
    * Support for command line parameters to specify register
      spacing, sizes, and bit offsets.
    * Support for power control with IPMI.  This allows a halt to
      power down a machine with IPMI.
    * A fix for a race condition with interrupts enabled on an
      SMP machine.  A lock was released then reclaimed, but
      there was code later that assumed that had not happened.
    * A fix for protecting the driver against bad responses from
      the controller chip.  In the past, the driver had assumed that
      the controller chip would not give it bad data.  This has
      turned out to be a bad assumption
    * ACPI interrupt handlers now return a return value, adjust
      accordingly.

    [PATCH] IPMI Watchdog handling updates
    
    Makes the IPMI watchdog more consistent with the other watchdog drivers.
    
    I have tested this and it seems to work correctly.  I also added docs for
    the interface change.
    
    - support disabling watchdog by writing 'V' to device.
    - unify printk()
    - use atomic bit operations on ipmi_wdog_open

    [PATCH] nbd: fix struct request race condition
    
    Here's a patch to fix a race condition in nbd that was causing struct
    request corruption (requests were being freed while still in use).  This
    patch improves on the previous one, which admittedly was a bit dodgy, using
    struct request's ref_count field (I should have listened to Jens in the
    first place :).  This should fix all the corner cases related to struct
    request usage/freeing in nbd.  My stress tests do a lot better with this
    patch applied.

    [PATCH] kNFSd: fix race with flushing nfsd cache.
    
    To purge an nfsd-authentication cache, we set the flush time to later than
    last-refresh time in the cache and call cache_flush.  The easiest way to
    find 'later than last-refresh' is 'now+1'.
    
    This has two problems.
    
      1/ if the time-of-day clock has gone bacwards, some entries might not
         be purged
      2/ if a new entry is added in the same second as cache_purge ran, it will
         get ignored.
    
    To resolve these issues, we set the flushtime to the maximum possible time
    before calling cache_flush, and then set it back to the minimum time
    afterwards.

    [PATCH] nfsd: simplify auth_domain_lookup
    
    The interface between the auth_domain and the cache code is messy; the
    auth_domain code is the only real user of the full 11-argument
    DefineCacheLookup, and does weird stuff with it (like passing in through one
    of the arguments a bit of code with a conditional return).
    
    We could further parametrize DefineCacheLookup, but I think it's already too
    complicated.
    
    My solution is to just ignore DefineCacheLookup and write the
    auth_domain_lookup function from scratch.  It's actually a pretty short
    function (much simpler than DefineCacheLookup itself), and it's much easier to
    read this short function than it is to read some special-cased
    DefineCacheLookup to verify that it does what it says it does....

    [PATCH] Concurrent O_SYNC write support
    
    In databases it is common to have multiple threads or processes performing
    O_SYNC writes against different parts of the same file.
    
    Our performance at this is poor, because each writer blocks access to the
    file by waiting on I/O completion while holding i_sem: everything is
    serialised.
    
    The patch improves things by moving the writing and waiting outside i_sem.
    So other threads can get in and submit their I/O and permit the disk
    scheduler to optimise the IO patterns better.
    
    Also, the O_SYNC writer only writes and waits on the pages which he wrote,
    rather than writing and waiting on all dirty pages in the file.
    
    The reason we haven't been able to do this before is that the required walk
    of the address_space page lists is easily livelockable without the i_sem
    serialisation.  But in this patch we perform the waiting via a radix-tree
    walk of the affected pages.  This cannot be livelocked.
    
    The sync of the inode's metadata is still performed inside i_sem.  This is
    because it is list-based and is hence still livelockable.  However it is
    usually the case that databases are overwriting existing file blocks and
    there will be no dirty buffers attached to the address_space anyway.
    
    The code is careful to ensure that the IO for the pages and the IO for the
    metadata are nonblockingly scheduled at the same time.  This is am improvemtn
    over the current code, which will issue two separate write-and-wait cycles:
    one for metadata, one for pages.
    
    Note from Suparna:
    Reworked to use the tagged radix-tree based writeback infrastructure.

    [PATCH] token based thrashing control
    
    The following experimental patch implements token based thrashing
    protection, using the algorithm described in:
    
    	http://www.cs.wm.edu/~sjiang/token.htm
    
    When there are pageins going on, a task can grab a token, that protects the
    task from pageout (except by itself) until it is no longer doing heavy
    pageins, or until the maximum hold time of the token is over.
    
    If the maximum hold time is exceeded, the task isn't eligable to hold the
    token for a while more, since it wasn't doing it much good anyway.
    
    I have run a very unscientific benchmark on my system to test the
    effectiveness of the patch, timing how a 230MB two-process qsbench run
    takes, with and without the token thrashing protection present.
    
    normal 2.6.8-rc6:	6m45s
    2.6.8-rc6 + token:	4m24s
    
    This is a quick hack, implemented without having talked to the inventor of
    the algorithm.  He's copied on the mail and I suspect we'll be able to do
    better than my quick implementation ...

    [PATCH] rcu: use call_rcu_bh() in route cache
    
    Use call_rcu_bh() in route cache.  This allows faster grace periods and avoids
    dst cache overflows during DoS testing.
    
    This patch uses the call_rcu_bh() api in route cache code to facilitate
    quicker RCU grace periods.  Quicker grace periods avoid overflow of dst cache
    in heavily loaded routers as seen in Robert Olsson's testing.

    [PATCH] rcu: introduce call_rcu_bh()
    
    Introduces call_rcu_bh() to be used when critical sections are mostly in
    softirq context.
    
    This patch introduces a new api - call_rcu_bh().  This is to be used for RCU
    callbacks for whom the critical sections are mostly in softirq context.  These
    callbacks consider completion of a softirq handler to be a quiescent state.
    So, in order to make reader critical sections safe in process context,
    rcu_read_lock_bh() and rcu_read_unlock_bh() must be used.  Use of softirq
    handler completion as a quiescent state speeds up RCU grace periods and
    prevents too many callbacks getting queued up in softirq-heavy workloads like
    network stack.

    [PATCH] rcu: clean up code
    
    Avoids per_cpu calculations and also prepares for call_rcu_bh().
    
    At OLS, Rusty had suggested getting rid of many per_cpu() calculations in RCU
    code and making the code simpler.  I had already done that for the rcu-softirq
    patch earlier, so I am splitting that into two patch.  This first patch cleans
    up the macros and uses pointers to the rcu per-cpu data directly to manipulate
    the callback queues.  This is useful for the call-rcu-bh patch (to follow)
    which introduces a new RCU mechanism - call_rcu_bh().  Both generic and
    softirq rcu can then use the same code, they work different global and percpu
    data.

    [PATCH] RCU: low latency rcu
    
    This patch makes RCU callbacks friendly to scheduler.  It helps low latency
    by limiting the number of callbacks invoked per tasklet handler.  Since we
    cannot schedule during a single softirq handler, this reduces size of
    non-preemptible section significantly, specially under heavy RCU updates.
    The limiting is done through a kernel parameter rcupdate.maxbatch which is
    the maximum number of RCU callbacks to invoke during a single tasklet
    handler.

    [PATCH] RCU - cpu offline fix
    
    This fixes the RCU cpu offline code which was broken by singly-linked RCU
    changes.  Nathan pointed out the problems and submitted a patch for this.
    This is an optimal fix - no need to iterate through the list of callbacks,
    just use the tail pointers and attach the list from the dead cpu.

    [PATCH] RCU - cpu-offline-cleanup
    
    There is a series of patches in my tree and these 3 are the first ones that
    should probably be merged down the road.  Descriptions are on top of the
    patches.  Please include them in -mm.
    
    A lot of RCU code will be cleaned up later in order to support
    call_rcu_bh(), the separate RCU interface that considers softirq handler
    completion a quiescent state.
    
    This patch:
    
    Minor cleanup of the hotplug code to remove #ifdef in cpu event notifier
    handler.  If CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU is not defined, CPU_DEAD case will be
    optimized off.

    [PATCH] prio_tree: iterator + vma_prio_tree_next cleanup
    
    Currently we have:
    
    	while ((vma = vma_prio_tree_next(vma, root, &iter,
                                            begin, end)) != NULL)
    		do_something_with(vma);
    
    Then iter,root,begin,end are all transfered unchanged to various functions.
     This patch hides them in struct iter instead.
    
    It slightly lessens source, code size, and stack usage.  Patch compiles and
    tested lightly.

    Content of vma->shared should be considered undefined, until this vma is

    [PATCH] rivafb: directcolor mode and miscellaneous fixes
    
    Although the rivafb advertises its capability as DirectColor, the hardware
    is actually set in Truecolor (CLUT cannot be altered).  This mismatch
    occasionally produces wrong colors, such as wrong logo colors at 32bpp and
    gamma utilities (such as xgamma) does not work at all.
    
    Changes:
    
    1. Fixes the above problems by setting the hardware to accept changing
       of the CLUT.
    
    2. Fixes color problems for NV_ARCH_03 (Riva128)
    
    3. Build a private modelist from the EDID (for use by fbcon)
    
    4. Mark several functions/data as __devinit/__initdata
    
    5. Remove unused fields from struct riva_par

    [PATCH] fbcon: ifferentiate bits_per_pixel from color depth
    
    1. If you remember this thread (HP300 support checked in), one concern
       was how to support framebuffers with bpp == 8 but color depth < 8
       (chunky layout).  I suggested to use the fields in var->{red|green|blue}
       to differentiate between bits_per_pixel and depth.  Included is a patch
       that does that.
    
       (The above assumes background/foreground of 0/1.  If hardware needs a
       different value, such as 0 - black, 0xff - white, just indicate
       TRUECOLOR or DIRECTCOLOR and set info->pseudopalette correctly in
       xxxfb_setcolreg().)
    
       The patch will break the following drivers when in monochrome since
       they do not set the proper color bitfields.  I've included a fix in
       patch #2.
    
       68328fb
       bw2fb
       cirrusfb
       dnfb
       macfb
       stifb
       tx3912fb
    
    2. Besides the change above, support for the inverse and underline
       attribute is added in monochrome mode.  One should get text which are
       underlined/reversed if the corresponding attribute is set.
    
    3. Because vt.c uses a 16-color palette, use fbcon_default_cmap if
       framebuffer can do less than 16 colors.  In 4 colors, display will be
       grayscaled.  In 8 colors, display should have the same colors as a
       16-color console but will lack brightness/ intensity.
    
    4. Fix monochrome logo drawing.
    
    5. Reduce code of fbcon_putc so it just calls fbcon_putcs.

    [PATCH] break out zone free list initialization
    
    The following patch removes the individual free area initialization from
    free_area_init_core(), and puts it in a new function
    zone_init_free_lists().  It also creates pages_to_bitmap_size(), which is
    then used in zone_init_free_lists() as well as several times in my free
    area bitmap resizing patch.
    
    First of all, I think it looks nicer this way, but it's also necessary to
    have this if you want to initialize a zone after system boot, like if a
    NUMA node was hot-added.  In any case, it should be functionally equivalent
    to the old code.
    
    Compiles and boots on x86.  I've been running with this for a few weeks,

    [PATCH] make shrinker_sem an rwsem
    
    Use an rwsem to protect the shrinker list instead of a regular
    semaphore.  Modifications to the list are now done under the write lock,
    shrink_slab takes the read lock, and access to shrinker->nr becomes racy
    (which is no different to how the page lru scanner is implemented).  The
    shrinker functions become concurrent.
    
    Previously, having the slab scanner get preempted or scheduling while
    holding the semaphore would cause other tasks to skip putting pressure on
    the slab.
    
    Also, make shrink_icache_memory return -1 if it can't do anything in order
    to hold pressure on this cache and prevent useless looping in shrink_slab.

    [PATCH] slab: locking optimization for cache_reap
    
    Here is another cache_reap optimization that reduces latency when applied
    after the 'Move cache_reap out of timer context' patch I submitted on 7/14
    (for inclusion in -mm next week).

    [PATCH] get_random_bytes() returns the same on every boot
    
    At boot time, get_random_bytes always returns the same random data, as if
    there were a constant random seed.  For example, if I use the kernel level
    ip autoconfiguration with dhcp, the kernel will create a dhcp request
    packet with always the same transaction ID.  (If you have more than one
    computers, and they are booting at the same time, then this is a big
    problem)
    
    That happens, because only the primary entropy pool is initialized with the
    system time, in function rand_initialize.  The secondary pool is only
    cleared.  In this early stage of booting, there is usually no user
    interaction, or usable disk interrupts, so the kernel can't add any real
    random bytes to the primary pool.  And altough the system time is in the
    primary pool, the kernel does not consider it real random data, so you
    can't read from the primary pool, before at least a part of it will be
    filled with some real randomness (interrupt timing).  Therefore all random
    data will come from the secondary pool, and the kernel cannot reseed the
    secondary pool, because there is no real randomness in the primary one.
    
    The solution is simple: Initialize not just the primary, but also the
    secondary pool with the system time.

    [PATCH] Subject: cdrom.c get_last_written fixup
    
    There's something wrong in cdrom.c: cdrom_get_last_written() for instance
    calls cdrom_get_disc_info() and cdrom_get_track_info() to get information
    about tracks, but these functions don't ensure that all the
    track_information or disc_information structure is filled:
    
    	/* (buflen was first set to 8 to get track_information_length field) */
    
    	if ((ret = cdo->generic_packet(cdi, &cgc)))
    		return ret;
    
    	cgc.buflen = be16_to_cpu(ti->track_information_length) +
    		     sizeof(ti->track_information_length);
    
    	if (cgc.buflen > sizeof(track_information))
    		cgc.buflen = sizeof(track_information);
    
    	cgc.cmd[8] = cgc.buflen;
    	return cdo->generic_packet(cdi, &cgc);
    
    The second test ensures that at least we won't overflow the structure, but
    nothing ensures that all the structure will be filled.
    
    And indeed, we have a drive here that won't fill it all: the returned
    track_information_length field will be *less than*
    sizeof(track_information) - sizeof(ti->track_information_length), so that
    cdrom_get_last_written() reads values that weren't filled in!  As a result,
    we are sometimes unable to read some parts of CDROMs, depending on the
    uninitialized state of the structure...
    
    Here is a patch that adds filling checks: cdrom_get_disc_info() and
    cdrom_get_track_info() return the actual filled length, and it's up to the
    caller to check that this is enough for him to get the values it wants.
    
    Note: adding something like a
    #define spanof(TYPE, MEMBER) ((size_t) ((&((TYPE *)0)->MEMBER)+1))
    definition just near that of offsetof() in include/linux/stddef.h would
    make it more pretty, but still it won't help for bitfields :/

    [PATCH] s390: Use include/asm-generic/dma-mapping-broken.h
    
    ChangeSet 1.1371.413.23 [1] introduced the file
    include/asm-generic/dma-mapping-broken.h for architectures that don't
    support the new DMA API. I don't know if this is the case with s390,
    however, ChangeSet 1.1371.445.6 [2] introduced a set of changes that
    duplicate those in include/asm-generic/dma-mapping-broken.h.

    [PATCH] Fix x86-64 singlestep through sigreturn system call
    
    This patch just directly clones Davide Libenzi's i386 code for x86-64 in
    both 64-bit and 32-bit cases.  With this, the behavior of single-stepping
    all system calls is consistent.
    
    The syscall exit tracing caused by TIF_SINGLESTEP is superfluous in the
    case of sysret returns, but harmlessly so (since continuing afterward with
    PTRACE_CONT will have cleared TF as well as TIF_SINGLESTEP).  I figured
    that little bit of extra processing in the single-step case was better than
    adding code to ignore the flag in the sysret case.

    [PATCH] remove sync() from panic
    
    Various people have reported deadlocks and it has aways seemed a bit risky
    to try to sync the filesystems at this stage anyway.
    
    "I have seen panic failing two times lately on an SMP system. The box
     panic'ed but was running happily on the other cpus. The culprit of this
     failure is the fact, that these panics have been caused by a block device
     or a filesystem (e.g. using errors=panic). In these cases the  likelihood
     of a failure/hang of  sys_sync() is high. This is exactly what happened in
     both cases I have seen. Meanwhile the other cpus are happily continuing
     destroying data as the kernel has a severe problem but its not aware of
     that as smp_send_stop happens after sys_sync."

    [PATCH] cleanup of ipc/msg.c
    
    Attached is a cleanup of the main loops in sys_msgrcv and sys_msgsnd, based on
    ipc_lock_by_ptr().  Most backward gotos are gone, instead normal "for(;;)"
    loops until a suitable message is found.
    
    Description:
    
    - General cleanup of sys_msgrcv and sys_msgsnd: the function were too
      convoluted.
    
    - Enable lockless receive, update comments.
    
    - Use ipc_getref for sys_msgsnd(), it's better than rechecking that the
      msqid is still valid.

    [PATCH] handle blk_queue_tags_resize() allocation failures
    
    Fixes blk_queue_resize_tags to properly handle allocation failures.
    
    Currently, if a memory allocation failure occurs during
    blk_queue_resize_tags, the tag map ends up getting freed, which should
    not happen.  The old tag map should be preserved and only the resize
    should fail.

    [PATCH] blk_queue_free_tags() fix
    
    This is a resend of three ll_rw_blk patches related to tagged queuing.
    
    Currently blk_queue_free_tags cannot be called with ops outstanding.  The
    scsi_tcq API defined to LLD scsi drivers allows for scsi_deactivate_tcq to
    be called (which calls blk_queue_free_tags) with ops outstanding.  Change
    blk_queue_free_tags to no longer free the tags, but rather just disable
    tagged queuing and also modify blk_queue_init_tags to handle re-enabling
    tagged queuing after it has been disabled.

    [PATCH] add BH_Eopnotsupp for testing async barrier failures
    
    In order for filesystems to detect asynchronous ordered write failures for
    buffers sent via submit_bh, they need a bit they can test for in the buffer
    head.  This adds BH_Eopnotsupp and the related buffer operations
    
    end_buffer_write_sync is changed to avoid a printk for BH_Eoptnotsupp
    related failures, since the FS is responsible for a retry.
    
    sync_dirty_buffer is changed to test for BH_Eopnotsupp and return
    -EOPNOTSUPP to the caller
    
    Some of this came from Jens Axboe

    80485b3:       eb f4                   jmp    80485a9 <main+0x85>
    
    it produces:

    [PATCH] i386 oops output: dump preceding code
    
    This teaches the i386 oops dumper to dump opcodes preceding and after the
    offending EIP.  Supporting code against ksymoops has been tested and produces
    output like the below.
    
    Support for this was added to ksymoops-2.4.9.
    
    Note that ksymoops will guarantee that the disassembly after the <eip> value
    is always in sync - if the disassembly from the start of the Code: line does
    not sync up with the EIP address ksymoops will perform the resync.

    [PATCH] ibmveth: add memory barrier for hypervisor synchronisation
    
    This patch adds a memory barrier to ensure synchronization with the
    hypervisor (and avoid a panic when the hypervisor is halfway through
    writing to the descriptor).  It also removes an unnecessary check that is
    flawed anyway because the value can change between the atomic_inc() and the
    assert.

    [PATCH] HVCS fixes
    
    Here are a set of HVCS (drivers/char/hvcs.c) fixes that were suggested by Jeff
    Garzik on July 29th in his review of this driver as well as some other fixes
    for problems I found while reviewing the driver.  These are all relatively
    minor, but necessary.
    
    - Cleaned up curly braces on single line conditional blocks.
    
    - Replaced debug memset(...,0x3F,...) with memset(...,0x00,...).
    
    - Removed explicit '= 0' after static int declarations since these default
      to zero.
    
    - Removed list_for_each_safe() instances and replaced with
      list_for_each_entry() which cut down on amt of code.  The 'safe' version is
      un-needed now that the driver is using spinlocks.
    
    - Changed spin_lock_irqsave() to spin_lock() when locking hvcs_structs_lock
      and hvcs_pi_lock since these are not touched in an int handler.
    
    - changed spin_lock_irqsave() to spin_lock() in interrupt handler.
    
    - Initialized hvcs_structs_lock and hvcs_pi_lock to SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED at
      declaration tiem rather than in hvcs_module_init().
    
    - Added spin_lock around list_del() in destroy_hvcs_struct() to protect the
      list traversal from deletion.  The original omission was an oversight.
    
    - Removed '= NULL' from pointer declarations since they are initialized NULL
      by default.
    
    - Removed wmb() instance from hvcs_try_write().  They probably aren't needed
      with locking in place.
    
    - Added check and cleanup for hvcs_pi_buff = kmalloc() in
      hvcs_module_init().
    
    - Exposed hvcs_struct.index via a sysfs attribute so that the coupling
      between /dev/hvcs* and a vty-server can be systematically determined.
    
    - Moved kobject_put() in hvcs_open() outside of the
      spin_unlock_irqrestore().
    
    - In hvcs_probe() changed kmalloc(sizeof(*hvcsd),...) to
      kmalloc(sizeof(struct hvcs_struct)) because hvcsd references a NULL pointer
      at the time of kmalloc.
    
    - Incremented the HVCS_DRIVER_VERSION to 1.3.1
    
    arch/ppc64/kernel/hvcserver.c:
    
    - Changed function documentation of EXPORTed functions to comply with proper
      kernel-doc documentation style.
    
    - Changed 'unsigned int' types to 'uint32_t' to comply with how unit
      addresses and partition IDs are handled in other arch/ppc64 vterm code.
    
    - Cleaned up curly braces on single line conditional blocks.
    
    include/asm-ppc64/hvcserver.h:
    
    - Added kernel-doc style documentation for hvcs_partner_info struct.
    
    - changed 'unsigned int' types to 'uint32_t' to comply with how unit
      addresses and partition IDs are handled in other arch/ppc64 vterm code.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Use correct buffer size in RTAS call
    
    Firmware expects the size of the buffer that you hand it when you ask it
    for information about a hardware error to be of a very specific size, but
    different versions of firmware appearently expect different sizes; using
    the wrong size results in a painful, hard-to-debug crash in firmware.  Benh
    provided a patch for this some months ago, but appreantly missed this code
    path.  This patch sets up the log buffer size dynamically; it also fixes a
    bug with the return code not being handled correctly.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Extend ioremap/iounmap infrastructure
    
    The patch below implements the ability to query outstanding imalloc regions
    for a given virtual address range.  (Imalloc is the allocator of virtual
    space for ioremap.) The patch extends im_get_area() to allow a region
    criterion of IM_REGION_SUPERSET.  For a particular "superset" virtual
    address and size passed into im_get_area(), the function returns the first
    outstanding region that is contained within this superset region.
    
    The patch also changes iounmap_explicit() to allow for the unmapping of all
    regions that fit under a "superset".
    
    This ability is necessary for dynamic (runtime) removal of pci host bridges
    (PHBs).  For a PHB removal, the platform specification (the RPA) requires
    that all of its children slots already be dynamically removed.  Each of
    these slot-level removals has fractured the imalloc region assigned to the
    PHB at boot.  At PHB removal time, it is necessary to iounmap() the
    remaining artifacts of the initial PHB region.

    [PATCH] ppc64: better little-endian bitops
    
    Below patch reuses the big-endian bitops for the little endian ones, and
    moves the ext2_{set,clear}_bit_atomic functions to be truly atomic instead
    of lock based.
    
    This requires that the bitmaps passed to the ext2_* bitop functions are
    8-byte aligned.  I have been assured that they will be 512-byte or
    1024-byte aligned, and sparc and ppc32 also impose an alignment requirement
    on the bitmap.

    we don't do the kmalloc in that situation.

    Change the HZ timeout to HZ/5, increase the number of tries to 25 so the
    overall wait time is similar.  In practice, I've never seen the loop need
    more than two iterations.

    [PATCH] ppc64: bolted SLB entry for iSeries
    
    Tested, at least basically, on Power4 iSeries with shared processors, on
    Power4 pSeries and RS64 (non-SLB) iSeries machines.
    
    On pSeries SLB machines we "bolt" an SLB entry for the first segment of the
    vmalloc() area into the SLB, to reduce the SLB miss rate.  This caused
    problems, so was disabled, on iSeries because the bolted entry was not
    restored properly on shared processor switch.  This patch adds information
    about the bolted vmalloc segment to the lpar map, which should be restored
    on shared processor switch.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix v_regs pointer setup
    
    During some signal test, we found that v_regs pointer was not setup

    pointer was corrupted when vec registers were copied over.  When the signal
    handler returned, restore_sigcontext tried derefering the invalid pointer
    and in the process killed the app with SIGSEGV.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Reduce verbosity of RTAS error logs
    
    Currently on pSeries systems the kernel will print out a hex dump of any
    error events reported by the platform at boot time.  These can be rather
    large and are practically incomprehensible to humans.  With this patch, the
    kernel will by default print a 1-line summary for each error reported with
    the severity, type, etc.  printed as text strings.  The old behaviour is
    still available by using the rtasmsgs=on kernel command line option.  The
    patch also renames some RTAS-specific symbols to start with "RTAS_".

    [PATCH] ppc64 Fix unbalanced pci_dev_put in EEH code
    
    The EEH code currently can end up doing an extra pci_dev_put() in the case
    where we hot-unplug a card for which we are ignoring EEH errors (e.g.  a
    graphics card).  This patch fixes that problem by only maintaining a
    reference to the PCI device if we have entered any of its resource
    addresses into our address -> PCI device cache.  This patch is based on an
    earlier patch by Linas Vepstas.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Don't call scheduler on offline cpu
    
    When taking a cpu offline, once the cpu has been removed from
    cpu_online_map, it is not supposed to service any more interrupts.  This
    presents a problem on ppc64 because we cannot truly disable the
    decrementer.  There used to be cpu_is_offline() checks in several scheduler
    functions (e.g.  rebalance_tick()) which papered over this issue, but these
    checks were removed recently.  So with recent 2.6 kernels, an attempt to
    offline a cpu can result in a crash in find_busiest_group().  This patch
    prevents such crashes.

    [PATCH] ppc32: handle misaligned string/multiple insns
    
    This patch adds code to the ppc32 alignment exception handler to make it
    handle the load/store string and load/store multiple word instructions.
    This is an issue for older CPUs such as the PPC601, which traps on
    load/store string instructions which cross a page boundary (newer CPUs
    handle this in hardware).  I have a little test program which exercises
    this code, so I am reasonably confident it's correct.

    [PATCH] ppc32: optimize/fix timer_interrupt loop
    
    The following patch fixes the situation where the loop condition could
    generate a next_dec of zero while exiting the loop.  This is suboptimal on
    Classic PPC because it forces another interrupt to occur and reenter the
    handler.  It is fatal on Book E cores, because their decrementer is stopped
    when writing a zero (Classic interrupts on a 0->-1 transition, Book E
    interrupts on a 1->0 transition).  Instead, stay in the loop on a
    next_dec==0.

    [PATCH] NMI trigger switch support for debugging(updated)
    
    I made a patch for debugging with the help of NMI trigger switch.
    When kernel hangs severely, keyboard operation(e.g.Ctrl-Alt-Del)
    doesn't work properly. This patch enables debugging information
    to be displayed on console in this case.
    I think this feature is necessary as standard functionality.
    Please feel free to use this patch and let me know if you have
    any comments.
    
    Background:
    
    When a trouble occurs in kernel, we usually begin to investigate
    with following information:
     - panic >> panic message.
     - oops >> CPU registers and stack trace.
     - hang >> **NONE** no standard method established.
    
    How it works:
    
    Most IA32 servers have a NMI switch that fires NMI interrupt up.
    The NMI interrupt can interrupt even if kernel is serious state,
    for example deadlock under the interrupt disabled.
    When the NMI switch is pressed after this feature is activated,
    CPU registers and stack trace are displayed on console and then
    panic occurs.
    This feature is activated or deactivated with sysctl.
    
    On IA32 architecture, only the following are defined as reason
    of NMI interrupt:
     - memory parity error
     - I/O check error
    The reason code of NMI switch is not defined, so this patch assumes
    that all undefined NMI interrupts are fired by MNI switch.
    However, oprofile and NMI watchdog also use undefined NMI interrupt.
    Therefore this feature cannot be used at the same time with oprofile
    and NMI watchdog. This feature hands NMI interrupt over to oprofile
    and NMI watchdog. So, when they have been activated, this feature
    doesn't work even if it is activated.
    
    Supported architecture:
    
    IA32
    
    Setup:
    
    Set up the system control parameter as follows:
    
    # sysctl -w kernel.unknown_nmi_panic=1
    kernel.unknown_nmi_panic = 1
    
    If the NMI switch is pressed, CPU registers and stack trace will
    be displayed on console and then panic occurs.

    [PATCH] context-switching overhead in X, ioport()
    
    while debugging/improving scheduling latencies i got the following
    strange latency report from Lee Revell:
    
      http://krustophenia.net/testresults.php?dataset=2.6.8.1-P6#/var/www/2.6.8.1-P6
    
    this trace shows a 120 usec latency caused by XFree86, on a 600 MHz x86
    system. Looking closer reveals:
    
      00000002 0.006ms (+0.003ms): __switch_to (schedule)
      00000002 0.088ms (+0.082ms): finish_task_switch (schedule)
    
    it took more than 80 usecs for XFree86 to do a context-switch!
    
    it turns out that the reason for this (massive) context-switching
    overhead is the following change in 2.6.8:
    
          [PATCH] larger IO bitmaps
    
    To demonstrate the effect of this change i've written ioperm-latency.c
    (attached), which gives the following on vanilla 2.6.8.1:
    
      # ./ioperm-latency
      default no ioperm:             scheduling latency: 2528 cycles
      turning on port 80 ioperm:     scheduling latency: 10563 cycles
      turning on port 65535 ioperm:  scheduling latency: 10517 cycles
    
    the ChangeSet says:
    
            Now, with the lazy bitmap allocation and per-CPU TSS, this
            will really not drain any resources I think.
    
    this is plain wrong. An increase in the IO bitmap size introduces
    per-context-switch overhead as well: we now have to copy an 8K bitmap
    every time XFree86 context-switches - even though XFree86 never uses
    ports higher than 1024! I've straced XFree86 on a number of x86 systems
    and in every instance ioperm() was used - so i'd say the majority of x86
    Linux systems running 2.6.8.1 are affected by this problem.
    
    This not only causes lots of overhead, it also trashes ~16K out of the
    L1 and L2 caches, on every context-switch. It's as if XFree86 did a L1
    cache flush on every context-switch ...
    
    the simple solution would be to revert IO_BITMAP_BITS back to 1024 and
    release 2.6.8.2?
    
    I've implemented another solution as well, which tracks the
    highest-enabled port # for every task and does the copying of the bitmap
    intelligently. (patch attached) The patched kernel gives:
    
      # ./ioperm-latency
      default no ioperm:             scheduling latency: 2423 cycles
      turning on port 80 ioperm:     scheduling latency: 2503 cycles
      turning on port 65535 ioperm:  scheduling latency: 10607 cycles
    
    this is much more acceptable - the full overhead only occurs in the very
    unlikely event of a task using the high ioport range. X doesnt suffer
    any significant overhead.
    
    (tracking the maximum allowed port # also allows a simplification of
    io_bitmap handling: e.g. we dont do the invalid-offset trick anymore -
    the IO bitmap in the TSS is always valid and secure.)
    
    I tested the patch on x86 SMP and UP, it works fine for me. I tested
    boundary conditions as well, it all seems secure.

    Make some single-bit bitfields unsigned.
    
    Signed single-bit bitfields really are a pretty strange
    thing to have. They work, but it wasn't really intentional.

    fix sym2 negotiation
    
    The problems with domain validation were just the tip of the iceberg in
    the sym2 driver.  Most of its problems seem to come from an overly
    complex set of negotiating rules, which I've swept away with this patch.
    
    I also removed the ability to set parameters in the on-board bios and
    have the driver respect them. (this hasn't worked for a while in 2.6
    because after the driver sets them, Domain Validation resets them
    again).
    
    Finally, there was a really nasty bug where the driver negotiates
    improperly when turning off DT clocking.  If you simply turn it off, the
    driver originally fell back to using the old WDTR/SDTR method of
    negotiation.  However, since it thought the bus was already wide, it
    only emitted a SDTR, which causes the device to reset from wide to
    narrow.  Hence the driver thinks the device is wide and the device
    thinks it is narrow => boom.
    
    I redid the negotiation to predicate PPR messages on whether the device
    claims support for them or not.

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20040816 update from Bob Moore
    
    Designed and implemented support within the AML interpreter
    for the so-called implicit return.  This support returns
    the result of the last ASL operation within a control
    method, in the absence of an explicit Return() operator.
    A few machines depend on this behavior, even though it
    is not explicitly supported by the ASL language.  It is
    optional support that can be enabled at runtime via the
    acpi_gbl_enable_interpreter_slack flag.
    
    Removed support for the PCI_Config address space from the
    internal low level hardware interfaces (acpi_hw_low_level_read
    and acpi_hw_low_level_write).  This support was not used
    internally, and would not work correctly anyway because
    the PCI bus number and segment number were not supported.
    There are separate interfaces for PCI configuration space
    access because of the unique interface.

    Since skb_checksum_help() has been moved to xfrm[46]_output(), we don't
    need the sk_buff ** argument in x->type->output anymore.  This patch
    reverts it to a sk_buff *.

    [MMC] MMCI optimisations.
    
    Optimise register accesses; dereferencing "host" each time introduces
    extra loads.
    
    No need to check MCI_TXFIFOEMPTY when checking if we have a data IRQ.
    
    Since we support clock bypass mode, the maximum clock rate is the
    MCLK rate itself.

    [MMC] Fix race condition in MMCI write-path data channel.
    
    There seems to be a hardware race condition in the data channel where
    we could end up receiving IRQs for more data than we have available.
    Fix this by disabling IRQs when we run out of data; if the device
    really does want more data, we'll underrun and flag an error
    upstream.

    [PATCH] fix for Domain Validation hang on some devices with sym_2
    
    There's a bad hang where the driver locks the system solid trying to do
    domain validation with certain devices.  The one I've managed to
    reproduce it with is a Quantum Atlas.
    
    What happens is that setting the offset to zero is an async negotiation
    message.  However, the driver still seems to have DT set (which is
    illegal).  Most devices just reject this as stupid, but the Quantum
    seems to try to obey it and hangs the bus.
    
    The simple fix is to reset all PPR options when the offset is set to
    zero.

    [PATCH] Allow TCQ depth to be lowered properly
    
    Ran into a couple small issues with the patch. First,
    blk_queue_resize_tags wasn't getting exported, so I sent Jens a patch to
    fix this, which he has now sent upstream. Second, the comment above
    blk_queue_resize_tags says the queue_lock must be held when calling this
    routine. Attached is an updated patch that grabs the lock. Other than
    that, it looks good.

    The non unique SCSI ioctls:
    
    SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND
    SCSI_IOCTL_TEST_UNIT_READY
    SCSI_IOCTL_BENCHMARK_COMMAND
    SCSI_IOCTL_SYNC
    SCSI_IOCTL_START_UNIT
    SCSI_IOCTL_STOP_UNIT
    
    Have been deprecated for a while now.  We should make the kernel

    adequate warning before they are removed.

    kbuild: Remove check for undefined symbols in vmlinux
    
    Russell King reported that some gcc / bin-utils combination may result in
    undefined symbols in vmlinux and implemented a check for that.
    Though the cause is very valid this check has proved to be a real pain
    for other users, especially sparc and um.
    Short term a similar check is asked to be implemented in arch/arm*/Makefile
    and long-term to bail out if too old gcc / bin-utils is used.
    Long term plan awaits a new gcc / bin-utils release.

    This patch reuses the code in xfrm6_input.c for receiving xfrm6_tunnel

    to xfrm6_tunnel_input.  For example, it didn't move the MAC header down.

    Problem is that make does not know it have to visit scripts before it can use $(KALLSYMS)

commit de9b29d1de2ade882c5c16c0fdbf1f6008e0530f

    [IA64] various issues in the IA64 swiotlb code
    
    The biggest change is better overflow handling, partly ported from the AMD64
    IOMMU  code.  This is important for some 3d drivers who make use of this and can
    map a lot of memory.
    
    First it increases the default memory usage of swiotlb to 64MB.
    This was the value used in production systems in 2.4 (e.g. in SLES8) and the default
    was far too small.  Note this is only allocated when the swiotlb is needed.
    
    pci_map_single will not panic anymore on an overflow. Instead it returns
    a pointer to a scratch area and allows the caller to check using
    dma_mapping_error(). It still panics when the overflow buffer is exceeded.
    
    dma_mapping_error support is implemented.
    
    pci_map_sg will never panic now, but just return 0. Near all callers
    of it seem to have proper error checking for this (IDE will even handle
    it without erroring out)
    
    The handling of passing a NULL device is improved, previously it would
    never map in this case. i386 and other architectures assume NULL means a 4GB
    limit instead.   This code does this now too.
    
    I added support for swiotlb=force for easier testing.

    [ARM] Deprecate virt_to_bus/bus_to_virt.
    
    These macros don't take account of which bus is actually required,
    so they should not be used in new drivers; in fact, new drivers
    should use the DMA API.

    ppc32: Make use of cpufeatures in some flush rountines
    
    This is based on an observation from Pantelis Antoniou.  We get
    a minor speedup of flush_icache_range, __flush_dcache_icache and
    __flush_dcache_icache_phys, in that we do not need to do this on
    CPUs with a unified cache (601), so check for that feature bit
    instead of a PVR check.

    This patch against scsi-misc-2.6 reorders a call to scsi_forget_host in
    the scsi_remove_host function. This removes the error message
    "Synchronizing SCSI cache..." on rmmod of a scsi host driver module as
    shown in example output 1 and 2 below.
    
    I had previous created a much more complicated patch to work around this
    problem. In response Christoph mention a simpler solution (pointer to
    thread below) which is this patch.

    Only warn if $(host-progs) and $(hostptogs-y) are not equal.
    This allows external modules to use:
    hostprogs-y := file ...
    host-progs  := $(hostprogs-y)
    
    This is backwards compatible and will not warn.

    kconfig/all archs: Introduce Kconfig.debug
    
    Localize Kconfig debug options into one file (lib/Kconfig.debug)
    for easier maintenance, searching, and menu-building.
    
    Updated to 2.6.8.
    
    Summary of changes:
    
    . localizes the following symbols in lib/Kconfig.debug:
        DEBUG_KERNEL, MAGIC_SYSRQ, DEBUG_SLAB, DEBUG_SPINLOCK,
        DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP, DEBUG_HIGHMEM, DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE,
        DEBUG_INFO
      and FRAME_POINTER for some instances of it (if it's freely
      user-selectable) but not for the cases where it's forced or
      it depends on some other options.
    . adds DEBUG_KERNEL requirement to some DEBUG_vars;
    . remove KALLSYMS from S390-specific kernel hacking menu;
      use KALLSYMS in the EMBEDDED menu instead;
    . add CRIS and M68KNOMMU symbols for use in lib/Kconfig.debug;
    . eliminate duplicate "General setup" labels in sparc64 config;
    . whitespace cleanup;
    . fixed a few trival typos;

    [NET]: Enhanced version of net_random().
    
    Here is another alternative, using tansworthe generator.  It uses percpu
    state. The one small semantic change is the net_srandom() only affects
    the current cpu's seed.  The problem was that having it change all cpu's
    seed would mean adding locking and the only user's today are a couple of
    places that feed in mac address to try make sure address resolution to
    collide.

    not distingush between upper and lower case the rule:

    In a normal build this is only used for linker scripts.
    So create a separate rule for .lds files, and use generic cpp flags.

    kbuild: Bogus "has no CRC" in external module builds
    
    From: Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>
    The recent fixes for the external module build have fixed the major
    breakage, but they left one annoyance unfixed.  If CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is
    disabled, a warning is printed for every exported symbol that is has no
    CRC.  For instance, I see this when compiling the standalone Orinoco
    driver on Linux 2.6.6-rc3:
    
    *** Warning: "__orinoco_down" [/usr/local/src/orinoco/spectrum_cs.ko] has
    no CRC!
    *** Warning: "hermes_struct_init" [/usr/local/src/orinoco/spectrum_cs.ko]
    has no CRC!
    *** Warning: "free_orinocodev" [/usr/local/src/orinoco/spectrum_cs.ko] has
    no CRC!
    [further warnings skipped]
    
    I have found that the "-i" option for modpost is used for external builds,
    whereas the internal modules use "-o".  The "-i" option causes read_dump()
    in modpost.c to be called.  This function sets "modversions" variable
    under some conditions that I don't understand.  The comment before the
    modversions declarations says: "Are we using CONFIG_MODVERSIONS?"
    
    Apparently modpost fails to answer this question.  I think it's better to
    use an explicit option rather than a kludge.
    
    The attached patch adds a new option "-m" that is specified if and only if
    CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is enabled.  The patch has been successfully tested
    both with and without CONFIG_MODVERSIONS.

    [IPSEC]: Move encap check back down to esp4.c
    
    In a previous, I moved the encap_type checks in esp4.c from the packet
    processing path to xfrm_user/af_key.  This isn't ideal since those encap
    types only make sense for esp4.
    
    The following patch moves it back into esp4.c.  The difference is
    that it's now done in init_state so that it's only done once rather
    than per-packet.
    
    I've also added encap_type checks for every transform.  This means
    that people attaching encap objects to AH/IPCOMP/IPIP will now get
    errors.  That should be fine as no major KM does this.
    
    Please note that the error returned is now EINVAL instead of
    ENOPROTOOPT.  This shouldn't break anything since KMs only test
    the errno from setsockopt() for NAT-T support rather than add_sa
    where it would be too late anyway.

    AUTOSENSE bug in NCR5380.c
    
    From: 	Kenn Humborg <kenn@linux.ie>
    
    round line 2470 in NCR5380.c, if a command fails, and AUTOSENSE is on,
    the current command is converted into a REQUEST_SENSE command and
    put at the top of the request queue.  Part of this setup, is setting
    up cmd->SCp to point at the sense_buffer, so that the received sense
    data goes straight into the sense buffer.
    
    Around line 1730, NCR5380_select() calls initialize_SCp() which ends
    up clobbering cmd->SCp, and the sense data get written into the
    original request buffer.
    
    This is what happens if cmd->use_sg = 0.  I haven't looked at what
    happens if use_sg is non-zero, but I expect the effect will be the same.

      + DMA_32BIT_MASK for all;

    preload_stab() is only ever called (once) from flush_stab(), and
    flush_stab() is only ever called from switch_mm().  So, combine both

    kbuild: __crc_* symbols in System.map
    
    David S. Miller <davem@redhat.com> wrote:
    Shouldn't we be grepping __crc_ symbols out of the System.map file?
    
    For one thing, these can confuse readprofile.  It's algorithm is
    to start at _stext, then stop when it sees a line in the System.map
    which is not text (mode is one of 'T' 't' 'W' or 'w')
    
    It will exit early if there are some intermixed __crc_* things in
    there (since they are are mode 'A').
    
    For example, in my current sparc64 kernel I have this:
    
    00000000004cef80 t do_split
    00000000004cf2a0 t add_dirent_to_buf
    00000000004cf5a7 A __crc_init_special_inode
    00000000004cf640 t make_indexed_dir
    00000000004cf900 t ext3_add_entry
    
    So no symbols after add_dirent_to_buf will be shown in the profiling
    output of readprofile.
    
    Implementation ported to mksysmap by Sam.
    Included two System.map related fixes:
    - Print "SYSMAP  System.map" during build
    - Sort symbols in System.map

    [CPUFREQ] avoid re-enabling of interrupts too early during resume
    
    Avoid re-enabling the interrupts in "write_sequnlock_irq" in
    cpufreq_timer_notifier() when it gets called in "CPUFREQ_RESUMECHANGE" state
    -- that happens if the CPU frequency is detected to be different now from
    what it was during suspension, and that's a resume call of a sys device, so
    with interrupts off.
    
    Without this patch, it can cause nasty oopses. IIRC resume is done on one
    CPU only, so we don't need no lock anyways. Right?
    
    Many thanks to Brian J. Murrell for debugging this issue.

    kbuild: Use POSIX headers for ntoh functions
    
    From: Benno <benjl@cse.unsw.edu.au>
    When compiling Linux on Mac OSX I had trouble with scripts/sumversion.c.
    It includes <netinet/in.h> to obtain to definitions of htonl and ntohl.
    
    On Mac OSX these are found in <arpa/inet.h>. After checking the POSIX
    specification it appears that this is the correct place to get
    the definitons for these functions.
    
    (http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/htonl.html)
    
    Using this header also appears to work on Linux (at least with
    Glibc-2.3.2).
    
    It seems clearer to me to go with the POSIX standard than implementing
    #if __APPLE__ style macros, but if such an approach is preferred I can
    supply patches for that instead.

    kbuild: Introduce hostprogs-y, deprecate host-progs
    
    Introducing hostprogs-y allows a user to use the typical Kbuild
    pattern in a Kbuild file:
    hostprogs-$(CONFIG_KALLSYMS) += ...
    
    And then during cleaning the referenced file are still deleted.
    Deprecate the old host-progs assignment but kept the functionlity.
    
    External modules will continue to use host-progs for a while - drawback is
    that they now see a warning.
    Workaround - just assign both variables:
    hostprogs-y := foo
    host-progs  := $(hostprogs-y)
    
    All in-kernel users will be converted in next patch.

    [CPUFREQ] Initial Dothan speedstep support.
    
    here's a patch on top of the above patch that adds all of the
    dothan frequency/voltages for processors 715, 725, 735, 745, 755
    
    Tested and working as it should so far with a 745. The stepping in the
    model table for the others may need to be tweaked.
    
    The Dothan processor datasheet 30218903.pdf defines 4 voltages for
    each frequency (VID#A through VID#D) whereas Banias only suggests a
    typical voltage and no min or max for each freq so i've used the OP
    macro to allow definition of all voltages (A through D) but the macro
    currently just uses VID#C at compile time (the second lowest voltage
    profile).
    
    The docs define these 4 profiles but don't say anywhere in which cases
    they should be used. I guess it may be a case of usage of the differing
    profiles based on the tolerance and accuracy of the power supply in use
    for the specific application.

    [PATCH] PCI: fix PCI access mode dependences in arch/i386/Kconfig again
    
    While all ACPI stuff is deselected, and PCI access mode is set to "Any",
    CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT is going to be set because of CONFIG_PCI_MMCONFIG.
    
    If CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT is not allready set by other stuff, setting PCI access
    mode to "Any" shouldn't set CONFIG_PCI_MMCONFIG.  Anyhow, setting PCI
    access mode to "MMConfig" should select CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT.

    [PATCH] I2C: port smsc47m1 to 2.6
    
    Here is my port of the smsc47m1 i2c hardware monitoring driver to Linux
    2.6. The original driver was written by Mark D. Studebaker, and my work
    is based on a preliminary port by Gabriele Gorla, who came in with an
    almost finished driver, but vanished before cleaning it up. I finished
    the job and improved things a bit. Credits go to Ivars Strazdins and
    Cassio Freitas for testing the driver (having no hardware, I couldn't
    test the code myself).

    [PATCH] I2C: update the lm83 driver
    
    This is an update to the Linux 2.6 lm83 hardware monitoring driver.
    
    * Follow the sysfs interface naming conventions.
    * Fix the "force" module parameter.
    * Fix limit settings checks.
    * Driver is no longer tagged experimental.
    
    These changes are the result of me finally succeeding in getting my LM83
    evaluation board to work. If there are norms and standards about how
    evaluation boards can be wired, I guess I did not respect any of them,
    but it works ;)

    [PATCH] w1: Added dynamic slave removal mechanism. Fixed bug when we have multiple slave with different families.
    
    Added dynamic slave removal mechanism by introducing u32 flags; in each slave.
            If slave was found during search process then set flag.
            If after search complete we have slave entryes without magic flag then remove them.
    Fixed bug when we have multiple slave with different families.
            Since attributes were static then each new family will rewrite static values with new
            function pointers... badly broken.

    kbuild: Use LINUXINCLUDE to specify include/ directory
    
    Peter Chubb <peterc@gelato.unsw.edu.au> reported that building i386
    on a non-i386 platform failed, because gcc could not locate boot.h.
    Root cause was the extra include2 directory used when using O=
    to specify the output directory.
    Added LINUXINCLUDE as a portable way to specify the include/
    directory, and changed the two users.
    This avoids hardcoding 'include2' in non-kbuild core files.

    At least one bin-utils version for ARM is know to ignore undefined

    Add an explicit check for undefined symbols to catch this.
    The check is made in combination with generating the System.map file
    and the actual algorithm is moved to a small shell script - mksysmap.
    
    External symbols with three leading underscores are ignored - sparc
    uses them for the BTFIXUP logic.

    is racy, but (1) the race is fairly harmless, (2) it can be occur elsewhere as an inevitable
    consequence of the current usbfs api, this just makes it fractionally more likely.

    [PATCH] USB: add <linux/usb_otg.h>
    
    Hardware implementing USB-OTG needs to use an OTG controller and/or
    transceiver driver to switch the Mini-AB connector between the host
    and peripheral side controller drivers (and the USB device role
    supported by that driver).
    
    This patch adds a simple "otg_transceiver" interface that can abstract
    implementation details for that port, as needed for some upcoming patches:
    
        - Neither host nor peripheral controller drivers need to know about
          how the OTG controller is implemented.  Example: is the transceiver
          internal?  If not, which external chip?
    
        - The OTG controller doesn't need to know if the Host Controller
          is OHCI, EHCI, or something custom ... all it knows is that the
          HCD looks like a "usb_bus".
    
        - In the same way, the peripheral controller is just a "usb_gadget".
    
    One implementation of this will be posted soon; the interface is by
    no means cast in stone, other implementations may need to morph this
    interface a bit.

    [PATCH] I2C: algorithm and bus driver for PCA9564
    
    Attached is a driver for the PCA9564 "Parallel to I2C" chip, it is
    similar in principle to the PCF8584 which is supported by the
    i2c-algo-pcf and i2c-elektor code, however it's not code compatible in
    any way: http://www.semiconductors.philips.com/pip/PCA9564PW.html
    
    The patch contains the PCA algorithm driver and a bus driver for an ISA
    card. It only supports master send and receive but I'm not sure that the
    Linux i2c stack supports client side operation anyhow, and I have no
    hardware to test on.
    
    It was tested on a PC104 card containing the PCA chip and an Atmel TPM
    device and also on a separate PC104 card with a DS1307 RTC hotwired onto
    it for testing purposes.
    
    The driver is against a 2.6 BK tree pulled on Friday. I also have a
    fairly trivial 2.4 backport if that is of interest.

    [PATCH] PCI: rpaphp build break - remove eeh register
    
    The following patch removes eeh function calls that currently break the
    RPA PCI Hotplug module.  The functions in question were rejected from
    mainline, and an alternate solution is being worked.

    [ACPI] restore PCI Interrupt Link Devices upon resume
    
    * register as as a sys_device so that we can get resume callbacks and restore
      interrupt routing state.
    * add acpi_pci_link_resume(), which will be called when resuming from a suspend
      state that needs IRQ routing to be restored. This fixes issues reported on
      the mailing lists, e.g.:
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=acpi4linux&m=109142999328643&w=2
    * rename setonboot --> initialized
    * change to test acpi_noirq in init
    
    We want to initialize everything on S3 resume in case the BIOS points an
    interrupt link somewhere we didn't expect. (Doing so avoids "missing interrupt"
    or "irq x: nobody cared" problems.) According to Len, past experience has shown
    that it's a good idea to initialize only devices that exist or were explicitly
    asked for, so we try to initialize only the IRQ's that were previously
    initialized at some point before suspend, by checking the "initialized" flag.
    This corresponds to links that have PCI devices attached.  Everything else, we
    leave alone. Assuming the BIOS does the same thing on resume that it did on
    boot, this will leave all the unused links in the same state that they were on
    boot.
    
    We are registered as a sysdev in order to do this work fairly early during
    resume, before devices are resumed; some devices may not call
    pci_device_enable.
    
    Previous "setonboot once" behavior is left in place, to be conservative.

    These drivers 'inherited' the license of the old agpgart code, which was
    licensed as 'and additional rights' even though those rights were never

    This was a hangover from the days when agpgart maintainence was done primarily
    in the X tree, where GPL code cannot live without 'additional rights'.
    
    These days, agpgart maintainence happens in the kernel tree, so these
    'additional rights' mean nothing.  Remove them from some drivers.

    [CPUFREQ] fix HT oops on speedstep-ich system
    
    Bugfix for #3012 @ http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3012
    
    The speedstep-ich driver only registers for CPU0 (which is a sane thing to
    do). However, cpufreq_notify_transition() currently assumes the CPU
    specified in the freqs.cpu parameter has actually been registered with the
    CPUfreq core. This is obviously not the case for HT speedstep-ich CPUs,
    causing an OOPS. The long-term solution will be to merge the "cpufreq
    CPU group awareness patches" already RFC'ed to this list; but they still
    need a bit of polishing and testing.
    
    Thanks to Boris Fersing for reporting the bug and testing this fix.

    [CPUFREQ] speedstep-ich SMT support.
    i have noticed that the most recent vanilla kernel oopses on a P4M-HT
    (because only one CPU is registered in sysfs but 2 are informed of a
    change of state). also there are some returns out of subroutines before
    set_cpus_allowed() is performed to restore the mask prior to entering
    the subroutine (this should not matter on uniprocessor systems, but
    still...).
    
    this patch should fix these 2 issues. for the first one, it registers
    all logical cpu's and a tiny modification is made in cpufreq.c to
    perform a policy change on all siblings.

    Intel8x0-modem driver
    Fixed the reset problem of shared audio/modem drivers.
    
    This patch fixes the problem that the shared audio/modem drivers reset
    the codecs with each other at loading time.
    Currently, intel8x0 and atiixp drivers are supported.
    The other drivers (if any) should add the new shared type in ac97_codec.h.

    [PATCH] USB: usb_get_descriptor, more error checks
    
    I've had different versions of this floating around for a while;
    basically, the goal is to be more robust against devices that
    misbehave by returning garbage descriptors in certain cases.
    
    Add an extra check when fetching descriptors:  the type must be
    correct.  This guards against different types of firmware (or maybe
    hardware) errors than the two checks already being made.

    [PATCH] USB Storage: cleanups, mostly
    
    This patch is originally from Christoph Hellwig.
    
    This patch coverts from Scsi_Foo typefs to struct scsi_cmnd, and moved from

    It also switches to the proper (or so they tell me) use of <scsi/*.h>
    headers.  This also includes some additional reshuffling to avoid useless
    headers in the usb-storage local headers (to improve compile time).

    [PATCH] USB Storage: fix Genesys Logic based on info from vendor
    
    In theory, this is the fix we need to make Genesys Logic devices work.
    This patch started life as as343, which was created based on some
    information which a user finally coaxed out of Genesys Logic.  Limited
    end-user testing gives good results.
    
    As we expected, it's a bug in their device.  This is really a workaround
    for what is almost certainly a timing problem.  Apparently, the 'popular'
    OSes don't push the device as hard as Linux does.
    
    Although it is likely that this workaround is not needed for all Genesys
    devices, Genesys was unable/unwilling to provide us with the explicit list
    of VID/PIDs which required this -- thus we apply it to all Genesys devices.
    
    We have lots of good reports with max_sectors set to 128 with these
    devices, but the official recommendation is to set that to 64.  End-users
    can experiment with higher values (for higher performance) via the runtime
    sysfs interface to that parameter.
    
    I would like to give special thanks to the users who hounded Genesys into
    giving up this information, and to Alan Stern for not giving up on this
    vendor long after I had.

    unless some earlier device in the product line had incorrect descriptor

    [PATCH] USB: Add support for FT2232C chip to ftdi_sio
    
    This patch adds support for the FTDI FT2232C USB to dual serial port
    converter to the ftdi_sio driver.
    
    The patch is based on a fork of the 2.4 ftdi_sio driver by Steven
    Turner of FTDI, and a preliminary port of these changes to the 2.6
    ftdi_sio driver by Rus V. Brushkoff.  I've tidied it up and fixed a
    couple of things.
    
    I don't have a FT2232C to test it with, but Steven Turner of FTDI
    has tested it.  He mentioned a couple of known problems with the
    driver, but nothing to do with this patch.

    [PATCH] USB: ftdi_sio doesn't re-assert DTR modem control line
    
    I've dredged up another old ftdi_sio patch that I never Cc'd to you
    the first time.  Please see Nathan's description below.
    
    It applies okay against your usb-2.6 tree, with or without the patch
    I posted yesterday to support the FT2232C chip and neither patch
    invalidates the other in any way.

    Nathan's email suffered from a line-folding bug (blame M$,

    [PATCH] USB: Hackish fix for cyberjack driver
    
    The following patch is in use by REINER-SCT customres for some time and
    works for them in about 90% of all cases.  I would really appreciate
    this going in before 2.6.8-final, since the device doesn't work at all
    with current 2.6.x driver.
    
    Changes:
    - bump version number
    - open interrupt endpoint in startup() rather than open

    [PATCH] USB: usb hub docs and locktree()
    
    Please merge; the CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND patch depends on it.
    
    This hub patch:
    
     - updates internal docs about locking, matching current usage
       for device state spinlock and dev->serialize semaphore
    
     - adds locktree() to use with signaling that affect everything
       downstream of a given device ... right now just khubd uses it,
       but usb_reset_device() should too (not just with hub resets...)
    
     - adds hub_quiesce()/hub_reactivate() ... former is used now
       during shutdown, both are needed in suspend/resume paths
    
    Net change in behavior for current systems should be nothing.

    [PATCH] USB: add CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND
    
    This is the core of the USB_SUSPEND functionality.  Please merge.
    
    This adds an experimental CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND option, which supports the
    USB "suspend" state.  Linux-USB hosts have previously ignored that state.
    
        -	New driver API calls, usb_suspend_device() and its
    	sibling usb_resume_device().
    
        -	Access to those calls through sysfs, such as
    		echo -n 2 > power/state
    		echo -n 0 > power/state
    
    That can be used to reduce the power consumption of any given USB device,
    then re-activate it later.  Eventually, most USB device drivers should
    probably suspend idle USB devices.
    
    One problem with this patch:  USB drivers without suspend() callbacks
    may badly misbehave.  Right now only hub drivers know suspend().  If the
    driver core didn't self-deadlock when we try it, unbinding those drivers
    from those devices (then re-enumerating on resume) would be perfect...
    the current compromise is just to emit a warning message.
    
    In conjunction with host controller driver support (already merged for
    OHCI and EHCI), PCI host controllers will issue the PME# wakeup signal
    when a USB keyboard starts remote wakeup signaling.  (But the keyboard
    wasn't usable later, since HID doesn't try to suspend.)
    
    I understand some ACPI patches are circulating, and maybe already in
    the MM tree, to make a suspended system wake up given PME# signaling.
    It'd be great if someone made that work transparently with USB, but
    for now I'm told it'll need some sysfs setup first.

    [PATCH] USB: Make removable-LUN support a non-test option in the g_file_storage driver
    
    This patch follows the suggestions sent by Todd Fischer and Diego Dompe
    for making removable-LUN support part of the normal non-testing version of
    the g_file_storage driver.  It also moves LUN device registration to the
    correct place and eliminates a code path that stalls the bulk-out pipe in
    a racy way.
    
    There are also some smaller changes: update some comments, add initial
    debugging support for USB suspend/resume, and miscellaneous code cleanups.
    Last but not least, the driver has been sufficiently stable for
    sufficiently long that it's fair to remove the "(DEVELOPMENT)" warning in
    Kconfig.

    [PATCH] USB: Fix NULL-pointer bug in dummy_hcd
    
    This patch fixes a NULL-pointer-dereference bug in the dummy_hcd driver.
    It also makes the code slightly more elegant and removes an unnecessary
    buffer-overflow test.  Unfortunately it's still a little bit racy, but
    this is a fault it shares with other gadget controller drivers, like
    net2280.

    [PATCH] Fix double reset in aic7xxx driver
    
    From: Joe Korty <joe.korty@ccur.com>
    
    Fix occasional PCI bus parity errors on the Dell PowerEdge 4600 during
    boot.
    
    Symptoms: The LCD display would turn orange and display "PCI SYSTEM E13F5",
    and the following message would appear in /var/log/dmesg: "Uhhuh.  NMI
    received.  Dazed and confused, but trying to continue".
    
    By inserting a PCI card with a PDC20268 IDE controller and attaching to
    that a Sony DRU-510A DVD RW burner with an unloaded tray, the failure can
    be made to happen on every boot.
    
    Cause: The aic7xxx driver was resetting the onboard AIC7891 SCSI controller
    while waiting for a previous reset to complete.  This second reset confuses
    the controller causing it to put bad data onto the PCI bus.
    
    This is a backport of a RedHat 2.4.21-15.ELsmp fix.  A letter discussing
    this problem, or one very close to it, may be found at:

    [PATCH] ibmvscsi driver v1.5.1
    
    Based on comments from hch and jejb, an update to the ibmvscsi
    driver patch.  Primarily style issues, though the removal of
    gratuitous casting lead to some significant refactoring
    of functions.
    
    - Moved #include <asm/...> after #include <linux/...>
    - removed the map_direct_data and map_indirect_data and moved
       the function inline
    - Fixed function declaration style issues (static on a line by
       itself)
    - Removed bogus cast from dma_map_single
    - Moved setting of data transfer direction to a single helper
       function
    - Fixed up some gratuitous casting of types
    - Collapsed a couple of other functions inline
    - Removed bogus check for NULL from remove
    - Removed the "evt_struct_for" routine as being needlessly obfuscatory

    [PATCH] SCSI tmscsim.c: fix inline compile errors
    
    Original Patch From: Adrian Bunk <bunk@fs.tum.de>
    
    I looked at those 3 functions. dc390_EnableMsgOut_Abort is called 5 times
    in the code and is 0x30 bytes long (as compiled with 3.3.2), so,
    uninlining it, probably, makes most sense. The other 2 functions are
    called only ones each and from the interrupt, so, I applied the
    "alternative approach" to them - moved above the calling functions.

    [PATCH] orinoco merge preliminaries - comment/whitespace/spelling updates
    
    Various trivial cleanups to the orinoco driver: whitespace changes,
    spelling/capitalization errors corrected, some fairly insignificant
    comments added, removed or reformatted.

    Yes, this is closing gate long after the sheep have run, but I guess

    [PATCH] orinoco merge preliminaries - rearrange code
    
    Rearrange functions in the orinoco driver in a more logical order.
    This patch is large and looks complicated, but in fact only moves code
    around (within or between files) without changing it.  The only
    exceptions are some extra comments describing the file's layout, and
    updated prototypes for the new function order.
    
    This makes the order of functions match the 0.15rc1 version, so later
    patches have a fighting chance of being meaningful.

    [PATCH] acenic - don't print eth%d in messages
    
    Get rid of all the places the acenic driver could print "eth%d" because
    the device hasn't been registered yet.  Use the method of having a name pointer
    in the private device structure that changes from pci_name() to dev->name.
    There was already a field named 'name[]' in the private data structure, but
    it was set and never used!
    
    Use netdev_priv(dev) rather than dev->priv as well.

    The 8390 drivers had provision for using a single Tx buffer,
    which was educational back in the day when it served as an
    example driver, but it really hasn't been used and can go
    away which will make future maintenance easier.

    [NETFILTER]: Add tcp window tracking
    
    This is the tcp window tracking patch, incremental to all previous
    changes.  It is now by default enabled (i.e. in 'conservative' mode).
    If you think it's better to leave it disabled ('liberal' mode), you can
    change ip_conntrack_tcp_be_liberal to a different default value.
    
    Cheers,

    [NETFILTER]: Add conntrack runtime statistics
    
    This patch adds some runtime-statistics to the connection tracking core,
    pretty similar to what 'rtstat' does for the routing cache.
    
    This was the last patch in this incremental set.  The only thing I still
    have pending at this time is the tcp window tracking code.

    [NETFILTER]: Move error tracking into conntrack protocol helper
    
    This patch moves icmp_error_track out of the generic conntrack core and
    into the icmp helper, where it really belongs.  It also adds some
    generic infrastructure for logging packets that are 'out of spec'.

    - Move swsusp __setup options there. Remove resume_status variable in favor
      of simpler 'noresume' variable, and check it in pm_resume().
    - Remove software_resume() from swsusp; rename pm_resume() to software_resume().
      The latter is considerably cleaner, and leverages the core code.
    - Move software_suspend() to kernel/power/main.c and shrink it down a
      wrapper that  takes pm_sem and calls pm_suspend_disk(), which does the
      same as the old software_suspend() did.
      This keeps the same entry points (via ACPI sleep and the reboot() syscall),
      but actually allows those to use the low-level power states of the system
      rather than always shutting off the system.
    - Remove now-unused functions from swsusp.

    [Power Mgmt] Merge pmdisk and swsusp pagedir handling.
    
    This embodies the core of the swsusp->pmdisk cleanups. Instead of using the
    ->dummy variable at the end of each pagedir for a linked list of the page
    dirs, this uses a static array, which is kept in the empty space of the
    swsusp header.
    
    There are 768 entries, and could be scaled up based on the size of the page
    and the amount of room remaining. 768 should be enough anyway, since each
    entry is a swp_entry_t to a page-length array of pages. With larger systems
    and more memory come larger pages, so each page-sized array will
    automatically scale up.
    
    This replaces the read_suspend_image() and write_suspend_image() in swsusp
    with the much more concise pmdisk versions (not that big of change at this
    point) and fixes up the callers so software_resume() gets it right.
    
    Also, mark the helpers only used in swsusp as static again.

    [Power Mgmt] Merge pmdisk and swsusp signature handling.
    
    - Move struct pmdisk_header definition to swsusp and change name to struct
      swsusp_header.
    - Statically allocate one (swsusp_header), and use it during mark_swapfiles()
      and when checking sig on resume.
    - Move check_sig() from pmdisk to swsusp.
    - Wrap with swsusp_verify(), and move check_header() there.
    - Fix up calls in pmdisk and swsusp.
    - Make new wrapper swsusp_close_swap() and call from write_suspend_image().
    - Look for swsusp_info info in swsusp_header.swsusp_info, instead of magic
      location at end of struct.

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20040715 from Bob Moore
    
    Restructured the internal HW GPE interfaces to pass/track
    the current state of interrupts (enabled/disabled) in
    order to avoid possible deadlock and increase flexibility
    of the interfaces.
    
    Implemented a "lexicographical compare" for String and
    Buffer objects within the logical operators -- LGreater,
    LLess, LGreaterEqual, and LLessEqual -- as per further
    clarification to the ACPI specification.  Behavior is
    similar to C library "strcmp".
    
    Completed a major reduction in CPU stack use for the
    acpi_get_firmware_table external function.  In the 32-bit
    non-debug case, the stack use has been reduced from 168
    bytes to 32 bytes.
    
    Deployed a new run-time configuration flag,
    acpi_gbl_enable_interpeter_slack, whose purpose is to allow
    the AML interpreter to forgive certain bad AML constructs.
    Default setting is FALSE.
    
    Implemented the first use of acpi_gbl_enable_interpeter_slack
    in the Field IO support code.  If enabled, it allows field
    access to go beyond the end of a region definition if the
    field is within the region length rounded up to the next
    access width boundary (a common coding error.)
    
    Renamed OSD_HANDLER to acpi_osd_handler, and
    OSD_EXECUTION_CALLBACK to acpi_osd_exec_callback for
    consistency with other ACPI symbols.  Also, these symbols
    are lowercased by the latest version of the acpisrc tool.
    
    The prototypes for the PCI interfaces in acpiosxf.h
    have been updated to rename "register" to simply "reg"
    to prevent certain compilers from complaining.

    [PATCH] PCI Hotplug: rpaphp_add_slot.patch
    
    I found a bug in rpaphp code during DLPAR I/O testing.   When DLPAR ADD
    a non-empty I/O slot to a partition,  an adapter  in the slot  didn't
    get configured. The attached patch fixes that.

    [PATCH] PCI Hotplug: acpiphp extension for 2.6.7 part 2
    
    This patch adds the first driver that actually uses the callback
    function for attention LEDs that the acpiphp-attention patch
    adds.  It searches the ACPI namespace for IBM hardware, sets up
    the callbacks and sets up a handler to read ACPI events and
    forward them on to /proc/acpi/event.  It also exports an ACPI
    table that shows current hotplug status to userland.

    [PATCH] PCI Hotplug: acpiphp extension for 2.6.7, part 1
    
    This patch adds the ability to register callback functions with
    the acpiphp core to set and get the current attention LED
    status.  The reason this is needed is because there is not set
    ACPI standard for how this is done so each hardware platform may
    implement it differently.  To keep hardware specific code out of
    acpiphp, we allow other modules to register their code with it.

    [ADD] Add pci=firmware command line option
    
    This change is specifically needed for the IXP2000 platform. IXP2000
    platforms have various PCI devices with large memory space requirements
    (~3.5 GB total sometimes) and a banked PCI window that allows for accessing
    all 4GB of memory space.  The FW configures the devices on the bus in such
    a way that standard linux drivers (e100, e1000, ide) can work w/o any changes
    and places devices specific to Intel's closed source IXA sdk in regions of
    PCI memory space that require using special registers on the IXP. This can
    be accomplished in the kernel using a board-specific enumerator or a
    lot of fixups, but it is far easier to just accept what the FW has provided.

    The patch below removes all inlines from ips.c. As a side effect, this
    showed that 3 formerly inlined functions are completely unused which are
    also removed in the patch.
    
    An alternative approach to removing the inlines would be to keep all
    inlines that are _really_ required and reorder the functions in the file
    accordingly.

    > Short: The attached patch fixes the bug-report #2139 from kernel bugzilla.
    
    I wasn't quite convenient with the previous version of the patch, but I
    just wanted to get it working at first and get some comments as to whether
    the approach (put a workaround vs. blacklisting) is at all valid. Since no
    objections arrived, I guess, nobody minds this small trick. So, I am
    enclosing a reworked patch, which does essentially the same, but has some
    more careful checking, and overall looks saner, than the previous one.

    Fix region sizing problem in dma_mark_declared_memory_occupied()
    
    The current code reserves too few pages if addr isn't
    page aligned and size just spans onto the last page.
    Fix by increasing size by the addr misalignment amount.

    [libata] pio/dma flag bug fix, and cleanup
    
    In the transfer-mode cleanup recently, the code that set flag
    ATA_DFLAG_PIO disappeared.  Resurrect it.
    
    Remove ATA_QCFLAG_DMA, it isn't needed.
    
    Always set polling in the ->qc_issue function, rather than force
    the user to do it when setting up an ata_queued_cmd.  This gives
    maximum flexibility to the driver, letting the driver choose
    whether or not to poll.

    [libata sata_sx4] deliver non-data taskfiles using Promise packet format

Author: Adam Kropelin <akropel1@rochester.rr.com>
Date:   Mon Jul 5 17:38:52 2004 +0200

    This patch fixes another disconnect oops in hiddev.
    
    hid-core calls hiddev_disconnect() when the underlying device goes away
    (hot unplug or system shutdown). Normally, hiddev_disconnect() will
    clean up nicely and return to hid-core who then frees the hid structure.
    However, if the corresponding hiddev node is open at disconnect time,
    hiddev delays the majority of disconnect work until the device is closed
    via hiddev_release(). hiddev_release() calls hiddev_cleanup() which
    proceeds to dereference the hid struct which hid-core freed back when
    the hardware was disconnected. Oops.
    
    To solve this, we change hiddev_disconnect() to deregister the hiddev
    minor and invalidate its table entry immediately and delay only the
    freeing of the hiddev structure itself. We're protected against future
    operations on the fd since the major fops check hiddev->exists.
    
    There may still be an ordering of events that causes a problem but I can
    no longer reproduce any manually. There are enough different subsystems
    and object lifetimes interacting here that I may have screwed something
    else up; review is certainly welcome.

    PCM Midlevel
    
    snd_pcm_timer_resolution_change():
    
    Right, that function doesn't work well for 44100/1024 in 32 bits -- it
    ends up trying to calculate 1e7 * 1024 / 441 and having to divide
    both numerator and denominator by 4 (thus losing the rather crucial 1
    at the end of 441) before it can do the calculation without overflow.
    
    Attached is a patch against 1.0.5a that gets better results in this
    instance, by leaving the denominator alone and instead doubling the
    result back up by the same number of times as the multiplier had to
    be halved by.

    Fix Audigy + FX8010 capture (hw:x,2)
    
    
    This patch fixes capture problems from hw:x,2 on Audigy. It is same as
     previous, because it can be applied cleanly against CVS (I tested
    version from 23.06.2004) and hope it is still true for current CVS.
    
    I tested 4 channel recrding and it was OK.
    
    hw:x,2 records outputs from FX8010 (not FX buses)
    
    Using 'EFX voices mask' you can set channels what you want record.
    
    use alsactl store to store config
    edit this config (set true for needed channel for 'EFX voices mask'
    control) - I recorded channels 8,9,14,15 (front and rear output).
    use alsactl restore to restore config
    
    Looks like channel count must be power of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, ...).

    0.5-2MB block of memory on a single MCA card.

    Add vmalloc alignment constraints
    
    vmalloc is used by ioremap() to get regions for
    remapping I/O space.  To feed these regions back
    into a __get_free_pages() type memory allocator,
    they are expected to have more alignment than
    get_vm_area() proves.  So add additional alignment
    constraints for VM_IOREMAP.

    Add memory region bitmap implementations
    
    These APIs deal with bitmaps representing contiguous
    memory regions.  The idea is to set, free and find
    a contiguous area.
    
    For ease of implementation (as well as to conform
    to the standard requirements), the bitmaps always
    return n aligned n length regions.  The implementation
    is also limited to BITS_PER_LONG contiguous regions.

    Fixed the calculation of the current DMA position at the period boundary.
    
    In some cases, DMA residue returns the value 0 during the transition
    at the DMA boundary.  The patch handles it as the position 0.
    This may prevent the flood of 'invalid last pointer' debug messages
    on some devices.

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20040527 from Bob Moore
    
    Completed a new design and implementation for EBDA
    (Extended BIOS Data Area) support in the RSDP scan code.
    The original code improperly scanned for the EBDA by simply
    scanning from memory location 0 to 0x400.  The correct
    method is to first obtain the EBDA pointer from within
    the BIOS data area, then scan 1K of memory starting at the
    EBDA pointer.  There appear to be few if any machines that
    place the RSDP in the EBDA, however.
    http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2415
    
    Integrated a fix for a possible fault during evaluation
    of BufferField arguments.  Obsolete code that was causing
    the problem was removed. (Asus laptop boot crash)
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=121760
    
    Found and fixed a problem in the Field Support Code
    where data could be corrupted on a bit field read that
    starts on an aligned boundary but does not end on an
    aligned boundary.  Merged the read/write "datum length"
    calculation code into a common procedure.

    Fixed a problem where hardware GPE enable bits sometimes
    not set properly during and after GPE method execution.
    Result of ACPICA 20040427 changes.
    
    Removed extra "clear all GPEs" when sleeping/waking.
    
    Removed acpi_ht_enable_gpe and acpi_hw_disable_gpe, replaced
    by the single acpi_hw_write_gpe_enable_reg. Changed a couple
    of calls to the functions above to the new acpi_ev* calls
    as appropriate.
    
    ACPI_OS_NAME was removed from the OS-specific headers.
    The default name is now "Microsoft Windows NT" for maximum
    compatibility. However this can be changed by modifying
    the acconfig.h file.  Fixes EHCI probe issue:
    http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1762
    
    Allow a single invocation of acpi_install_notify_handler
    for a handler that traps both types of notifies (System,
    Device). Use ACPI_ALL_NOTIFY flag.
    
    Run _INI methods on ThermalZone objects. This is against
    the ACPI specification, but there is apparently ASL code
    in the field that has these _INI methods, and apparently
    "other" AML interpreters execute them.
    
    Performed a full 16/32/64 bit lint that resulted in some
    small changes.

    Handle copybreak.
    - velocity_rx_refill() is modified to allow the processing of a Rx desc
      ring wherein the empty skb slots are not necessarily contiguous. Given
      the preceeding changes, rx_copybreak should not need anything else;
    - the driver does not rely on rd_info->skb_dma set to NULL any more;
    - pci_dma_sync_single_for_{cpu/device} changes as a bonus;
    - more function documentation.
    
    Some inspiration borrowed from similar r8169 code.

    [PATCH] via-velocity: Rx buffers allocation rework
    
    Rework of the Rx buffers allocation:
    - Rx irq handler (velocity_rx_srv): defer the Rx buffer allocation until
      the packet processing loop is done;
    - a separate index related to the Rx descriptor ("rd_dirty") is introduced
      to distinguish the first Rx descriptor whose buffer has to be refilled.
      This way the driver does not need to confuse this descriptor with the
      most recently netif()ed one. Rationale: batch + rx_copybreak;
    - dirty/empty Rx descriptors are identified through the whole driver
      via an adequate NULL pointer in the velocity_rd_info[] array (see
      velocity_rx_refill() and velocity_receive_frame());
    - Rx descriptors need to be grouped by a multiple of 4 before they can
      be handed back to the asic (hardware constraint). This task is moved
      from the Rx processing loop to the Rx refill function;
    - factorization of code in velocity_init_rd_ring().

    input: Enhancements/fixes for PSX pad support:
    
        * Adds support for more than one controller. Previously more than
          one controller was initialized and the docs said they worked, but
          only one was actually read.
        * Removes unnecessary detection on initialization. This allows the
          module to be initialized without controllers plugged in (hot
          swapping controllers works). This removes a warning if the user
          has an unrecognized controller plugged in, but the only
          unrecognized controller I have been able to find information about
          online is the PSX mouse, which I've never actually seen.
        * Adds a GC_DDR option value to have direction presses register as
          buttons instead of axes. Allows the module to be used for Dance
          Dance Revolution emulators like Stepmania.
        * Adds psx_* to documentation.

    [PATCH] Small fixes and clean-up
    
    Bump driver version to mark recent major changes in driver code.
    
    Remove backoff parameter. The reason it was once introduced is gone.
    Continue to go with EEPROM default for now, will hard-wire IEEE backoff
    algorithm instead (later).
    
    Rhine-I needs extra time to recuperate from chip reset before EEPROM
    reload.
    
    Add Rhine model identification.

    [PATCH] Fix Tx engine race for good
    
    It finally dawned on me how to eliminate the race I've been narrowing
    down with earlier patches: Instead of writing the command registers as
    one word, write them one at a time (as bytes). The race was for settings
    bits in ChipCmd and ChipCmd1 (0x09) against the chip clearing CmdTxOn
    which is in ChipCmd.
    
    In addition to writing single bytes, the fix requires a switch from
    using bit 5 in ChipCmd0 to bit 5 in ChipCmd1 (which is equivalent)
    to signal Tx demand.
    
    Also, don't restart Rx engine "pre-emptively" in rhine_rx, that's a
    sure way to race with the chip.
    
    Introduce RHINE_WAIT_FOR, a macro for small busy loops with primitive
    completion checking.

    [PATCH] Remove options, full_duplex parameters
    
    Nobody complained although media locking parameters were broken
    forever. They were sort of fixed recently, but the code is still in a
    bad shape.
    
    More seriously, the options/full_duplex stuff has fundamental design
    problems that have been discussed in-depth on the list (e.g. effect of
    hotplugging, nameif, suspend/resume).
    
    For those needing media locking with Linux 2.6+ via-rhine, ethtool(8)
    is the replacement.

    [PATCH] Rewrite PHY detection
    
    Instead of probing, set phy_id to 1 for Rhine III and read phy_id from
    EEPROM-controlled register for Rhine I/II.
    
    Remove code for handling anything other than 1 MII PHY. If it wasn't
    unnecessary code to begin with, it would need to be fixed because it
    wouldn't work.
    
    Use mii_if_info.phy_id as the only container of phy_id. Not particulary
    happy about those names (phy_id vs. MII_PHYSIDx), but being consequent
    about it mitigates confusion.

    I see no reason to keep the non-NAPI option for e100.  This patch removes
    the CONFIG_E100_NAPI option and puts the driver in NAPI mode all the time.
    Matches the way tg3 works.
    
    Unless someone has a really good reason to keep the non-NAPI mode, this
    should go in for 2.6.7.

    - Implement the 'raw' touchscreen protocol for backward compatibility
      (/dev/input/ts[0-7] now speaks the protocol of the old /dev/h3600_ts, and
      the /dev/input/tsraw[0-7] speaks the protocol of the old /dev/h3600_tsraw
      device).
    
    - Support the ioctls for setting the calibration parameters.  The default
      calibration matrix is computed from the xres,yres parameters (duplicate the
      old behaviour), however this is not enough for a good translation from
      touchscreen space to screen space.
    
    - Fixed a old bug in tsdev: on a pen motion event X1,Y1 -> X2,Y2 the driver
      would output three events with coordinates: X1,Y1, X2,Y1, X2,Y2.  This
      happened not only with coordinates, but with pressure too.
    
    - Update James's email address
    
    - Remove mention of Transvirtual Technologies: they no longer exist.

    [PATCH] r8169: tx lock removal
    
    spinlock removal crusade.
    
    The patch rephrases the spinlock_irq() in rtl8169_start_xmit() and its
    companion in the Tx irq handling patch in terms of ordered operations.

    [PATCH] r8169: initial link setup rework
    
    Use rtl8169_set_speed() for link setup in rtl8169_init_one():
    - the code which handles the option checking is isolated;
    - display (once) a notice message about the deprecated interface;
    - rtl8169_open() enables the phy timer if the link is not up;
    - rtl8169_set_speed() checks that the netdevice is actually ready
      in order to activate the timer.

    [PATCH] r8169: link handling and phy reset rework
    
    Link handling changes (Andy Lutomirski <luto@myrealbox.com>):
    - removed rtl8169_hw_phy_reset() and its busy loop;
    - RTL8169_PHY_TIMEOUT is x10 to account for the removal of the
      phy_link_down_cnt loop in rtl8169_phy_timer();
    - added spinlocking in timer context for rtl8169_phy_timer to avoid
      messing with the {set/get}_settings commands issued via ethtool;
    - more TBI stuff.
    
    This patch differs from the former version on the following points:
    - the LinkChg irq does not enable the phy timer when the link goes
      down any more;
    - the phy timer is not enabled in rtl8169_set_speed();
    - removal of the initial renegotiation hack.

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20040427 from Bob Moore
    
    Completed a major overhaul of the GPE handling within ACPI CA.
    There are now three types of GPEs:
    wake-only; runtime-only; combination wake/run.
    
    The only GPEs allowed to be combination wake/run are for
    button-style devices such as a control-method power button,
    control-method sleep button, or a notebook lid switch.
    GPEs that have an _Lxx or _Exx method and are not referenced
    by any _PRW methods are marked for "runtime" and hardware enabled.
    
    Any GPE that is referenced by a _PRW method is marked for "wake"
    (and disabled at runtime).  However, at sleep time, only those
    GPEs that have been specifically enabled for wake via the
    acpi_enable_gpe() interface will actually be hardware enabled.
    
    A new external interface has been added, acpi_set_gpe_type()
    that is meant to be used by device drivers to force a GPE
    to a particular type.  It will be especially useful for the
    drivers for the button devices mentioned above.
    
    Completed restructuring of the ACPI CA initialization sequence
    so that default operation region handlers are installed
    before GPEs are initialized and the _PRW methods are executed.
    This will prevent errors when the _PRW methods attempt to
    access system memory or I/O space.
    
    GPE enable/disable no longer reads the GPE enable register.
    We now keep the enable info for runtime and wake separate
    and in the GPE_EVENT_INFO.  We thus no longer depend on
    the hardware to maintain these bits.
    
    Always clear the wake status and fixed/GPE status bits
    before sleep, even for state S5.
    
    Improved the AML debugger output for displaying the
    GPE blocks and their current status.
    
    Added new strings for the _OSI method, of the form
    "Windows 2001 SPx" where x = 0,1,2,3,4.
    
    Fixed a problem where the physical address was incorrectly
    calculated when the Load() operator was used to directly
    load from an Operation Region (vs. loading from a Field object.)
    Also added check for minimum table length for this case.
    
    Fix for multiple mutex acquisition.  Restore original thread
    SyncLevel on mutex release.
    
    Added ACPI_VALID_SXDS flag to the acpi_get_object_info interface
    for consistency with the other fields returned.
    
    Shrunk the ACPI_GPE_EVENT_INFO structure by 40%.
    There is one such structure for each GPE in the system,
    so the size of this structure is important.
    
    CPU stack requirement reduction:
    Cleaned up the method execution and object evaluation paths
    so that now a parameter structure is passed, instead of copying
    the various method parameters over and over again.
    
    In evregion.c:
    Correctly exit and reenter the interpreter region if and only
    if dispatching an operation region request to a user-installed
    handler. Do not exit/reenter when dispatching to a default
    handler (e.g., default system memory or I/O handlers)

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20040402 from Bob Moore
    
    Fixed an interpreter problem where an indirect store through an
    ArgX parameter was incorrectly applying the "implicit conversion
    rules" during the store.  From the ACPI specification: "If the
    target is a method local or argument (LocalX or ArgX), no
    conversion is performed and the result is stored directly to the
    target".  The new behavior is to disable implicit conversion
    during ALL stores to an ArgX.
    
    Changed the behavior of the _PRW method scan to ignore any and
    all errors returned by a given _PRW.  This prevents the scan from
    aborting from the failure of any single _PRW.
    
    Moved the runtime configuration parameters from the global init
    procedure to static variables in acglobal.h.  This will allow the
    host to override the default values easily.

    [MMC] Add MMC core support
    
    This patch adds core support to the Linux kernel for driving MMC
    interfaces found on embedded devices, such as found in the Intel
    PXA and ARM MMCI primecell.  This patch does _not_ add support
    for SD or SDIO cards.
    
    It is vaguely based upon the handhelds.org MMC code, but the bulk
    of the core has been rewritten from scratch.

    The loop in the irq handler is not needed any more as the high frequency
    events have been deferred due to napi usage.

    [PATCH] epic100: spin_unlock_irqrestore avoidance
    
    This patch avoids to duplicate a spin_unlock:
    - it is mostly an artifact due to wild goto;
    - it makes the generated code smaller.

    [netdrvr epic100] minor cleanups
    
    - extra pci_disable_device() to balance invocation of pci_enable_device()
      in epic_init_one() (-> error path + epic_remove_one());
    - lazy return status in epic_init_one(), tsss...;
    - memory dedicated to Rx descriptors was not freed after failure of
      register_netdev() in epic_init_one();
    - use of epic_pause() in epic_close() offers a small window for a late
      interruption just before the final free_irq(). Let's close the window to
      avoid two epic_rx() threads racing with each other.
