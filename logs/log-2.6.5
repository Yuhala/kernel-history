    Re-instate __ARCH_SI_BAND_T, to allow architecture overrides.
    
    We default to "long" (which is what POSIX says), but since
    a number of architectures have used "int" for historical
    reasons, we need to allow overrides.
    
    At least sparc64 needs this. Possibly others, but so far
    architecture maintainers haven't spoken up. ppc64 and x86-64
    are known to be ok with the default "long".

    When I was updating ppc/boot/simple/relocate.S to work on PPC_PREP systems, I
    in advertantly broke 4xx systems.  On classic PPC, the first three
    instructions are nops, of which the first two can be overwritten.  This is
    not true of 4xx (or 8xx, but that's not working right now anyhow).  The
    following is needed to fix this.

    [PATCH] fix the subarch build again after ACPI breakage
    
    The patch to check "maxcpus=N" early broke by putting maxcpus (a
    variable which is only exported by mpparse.c) into
    parse_cmdline_early().
    
    The fix is to make it depend on the correct CONFIG_ option.
    
    In the subarchitectures:
    
    CONFIG_X86_SMP is the one that means "I want standard x86 smp code" and
    that's what this should depend on.

    [PATCH] Fix swp_entry_t encoding
    
    From: Martin Schwidefsky <schwidefsky@de.ibm.com>
    
    This fixes a problem in sys_swapon that can cause the creation of invalid
    swap ptes.  This has its cause in the arch-independent swap entries vs.
    the pte coded swap entries.  The swp_entry_t uses 27 bits for the offset
    and 5 bits for the type.  In sys_swapon this definition is used to find how
    many swap devices and how many pages on each device there can be.  But the
    swap entries encoded in a pte can be subject to additional restrictions due
    to the hardware besides the 27/5 division of the bits in the swp_entry_t
    type.  This is solved by adding pte_to_swp_entry and swp_entry_to_pte calls
    to the calculations for maximum type and offset.
    
    In addition the s390 swap pte division for offset/type is changed from 19/6
    bits to 20/5 bits.

    [PATCH] run page_address_init() earlier
    
    If someone runs page_address() before page_address_init(), the kernel locks
    up over uninitialised spinlocks.
    
    This only happens with the 4:4 patch, but it is more robust to run
    page_address_init() before setup_arch().  page_address_init() simply
    initialises statically allocated storage.

    [PATCH] loop setup calling bd_set_size too soon
    
    From: Chris Mason <mason@suse.com>
    
    I think Andrew and I managed to mismerge the loop setup race fix.
    loop_set_fd is using get_capacity() to read the size of the disk and
    sending that to bd_set_size.
    
    But, it is doing this before calling set_capacity, so the size being used
    is wrong.  This should clean things up.

    alas it has not and as luck would have it, the hard limit bit someone today
    once again with a large app on a large machine.

    [PATCH] Fix hugetlb-vs-memory overcommit
    
    From: Andy Whitcroft <apw@shadowen.org>
    
    Two problems:
    
    a) The memory overcommit code fails oto take into account all the pages
       which are pinned by being reserved for the hugetlbpage pool
    
    b) We're performing overcommit accounting and checking on behalf of
       hugetlbpage vmas.
    
    The main thrust is to ensure that VM_ACCOUNT actually only gets set on
    vma's which are indeed accountable.  With that ensured much of the rest
    comes out in the wash.  It also removes the hugetlb memory for the
    overcommit_memory=2 case.

    so here is the patch to fix it in the kernel.

    From: David Gibson <david@gibson.dropbear.id.au>
    
    This patch adds a debugging message to the ppc64 hugepage code when we
    attempt to open the "low" (32-bit) hugepage window on PPC64, but can't
    because a (non-hugepage) mapping already exists in the region.

    [PATCH] ppc64: allow MAP_FIXED hugepage mappings
    
    From: David Gibson <david@gibson.dropbear.id.au>
    
    On PowerPC64 the "low" hugepage range (at 2-3G for use by 32-bit processes)
    needs to be activated before it can be used.  hugetlb_get_unmapped_area()
    automatically activates the range for hugepage mappings in 32-bit processes
    which are not MAP_FIXED.  However for MAP_FIXED mmap()s, even at a suitable
    address will fail if the region is not already activated, because there is
    no suitable callback from the generic MAP_FIXED code path into the arch
    code.
    
    This patch corrects this problem and allows PPC64 to do MAP_FIXED hugepage
    mappings in the low hugepage range.

    This creates DMA_ERROR_CODE and uses it everywhere instead of
    PCI_DMA_ERROR_CODE as we really want the three DMA mapping API's to return
    a single error code.  Also we now have dma_mapping_error and
    vio_dma_mapping_error - and this latter and pci_dma_mapping_error both just
    call the former.
    
    Also a small fix in the vscsi - dma_map_sg returns 0 to indicate an error.

    acpi: enable global wake events by default
    
    People need the global wake events even when not sleeping:
    they are used for lid open events at least on some laptops.
    As such, they should be enabled by default.
    
    You can disable them with "acpi_leave_gpes_disabled" if
    your machine doesn't need them, and you want to get a few
    less GPE's.

    [NETFILTER]: Do not require ip_forwarding for reset on a bridge.
    
    Currently, to be able to send a reset in the FORWARD chain of iptables
    for bridged traffic, ip forwarding must be enabled. This causes confusion
    and in some situations people really don't want to enable ip forwarding.
    The patch below lets the user send reset packets for bridged frames in
    the FORWARD chain, with ip forwarding disabled (as long as there is a
    route).

    In both uniprocessor and SMP, the fealnx driver's TX-submit path can

    lock that needed to be there all along, to fix this.
    
    There's another problem in the RX path, that will be sent as a separate
    patch, as soon as we get that patch 100% nailed down, and acceptable for
    a Release Candidate.

    [PATCH] ppc64: clean up virtual <-> absolute code
    
    From: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>
          Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    The iSeries has an arch-specific mapping from physical <-> absolute
    addresses.  Fortunately this is only used in a few places.  However, the
    following arch-specific macros/functions are provided in addition to the
    standard macros:
    
    	__a2p()
    	__a2v()
    	__p2a()
    	__p2v()
    	__v2a()
    	__v2p()
    	absolute_to_phys()
    	phys_to_absolute()
    	virt_to_absolute()
    	absolute_to_virt()
    
    Reduce them to these, with slightly shorter names, and taking either pointers
    or unsigned long (as per __va and __pa) rather than making the caller cast:
    
    	abs_to_phys()
    	phys_to_abs()
    
    And helper macros:
    
    	virt_to_abs()
    	abs_to_virt()
    
    As is standard, virtual addresses are returned as void *, physical and
    absolute as unsigned long.
    
    Note that the change the iSeries_setup is a little subtle: ea is set to
    __va(pa) above, so "phys_to_abs(pa)" is the same as "virt_to_abs(ea)".
    
    Also, REALADDR is renamed to ISERIES_HV_ADDR and used in a couple of places
    where appropriate.

    This patch just ensures that the RI bit is set really early as it seems it
    is not on iSeries Power4 machines (or maybe OS400 v5r3 does this).

    [PATCH] back out sysfs reference count change
    
    This backs out Maneesh's sysfs patch that was recently added to the
    kernel.
    
    In its defense, the original patch did solve some fixes that could be
    duplicated on SMP machines, but the side affect of the patch caused lots
    of problems.  Basically it caused kobjects to get their references
    incremented when files that are not present in the kobject are asked for
    (udev can easily trigger this when it looks for files call "dev" in
    directories that do not have that file).  This can cause easy oopses
    when the VFS later ages out those old dentries and the kobject has its
    reference finally released (usually after the module that the kobject
    lived in was removed.)
    
    I will continue to work with Maneesh to try to solve the original bug,
    but for now, this patch needs to be applied.

    [PATCH] ppc64: More incorrect syscall error test

    other one:

    [PATCH] ppc64: Add a sync in context switch on SMP
    
    For the same reason as ppc32, we need to ensure that all stores
    done on a CPU has reached the coherency domain and are visible
    to loads done by another CPU when context switching as the same
    thread may be rescheduled almost right away there.

    [PATCH] ppc32: PCI mmap update
    
    This updates the ppc32 PCI mmap facility to allow mmap'ing of space
    outside of the actual devices, using the host bridge resources instead.
    
    This allow userland to map things like legacy IO space by either using
    the bridge device itself, or simply any PCI device on the same bus
    domain

    [PATCH] ppc32: Allow PREEMPT with SMP in KConfig
    
    On ppc32, CONFIG_PREEMPT wasn't settable along with CONFIG_SMP
    for historical reasons (smp_processor_id() races). Those races have
    been fixes since then (well, should have been at least) so it's now
    safe to allow both options.

Date:   Mon Mar 29 18:51:17 2004 -0800

    [PATCH] ppc32: context switch  fixes
    
    This fixes a few issues with context switch on ppc32:
    
     - Makes sure we properly flush out all stores to the coherency domain
       when switching out, since the same thread could be switched back in
       on another CPU right away, those stores must be visible to all other
       CPUs.
    
     - Remove dssall in the assembly calls and do it now once in switch_mm
       (stop vmx streams).  Assume the G5 doesn't need a sync after dssall.
    
     - Remove bogus isync in the loop setting the userland segment registers
    
     - Do not switch the userland segments when the mm stays the same

    exception handler properly disables preempt when doing FP operations.

    [PATCH] Make pdflush run at nice 0
    
    Since pdflush was converted to be launched by the kthread infrastructure it
    has inherited keventd's `nice -10' setting.  That hurts interactivity when
    pdflush is doing lots of work writing back through the dm-crypt layer.
    
    So set pdflush back to `nice 0'.

    [PATCH] catch errors when completing bio pairs
    
    From: Mike Christie <michaelc@cs.wisc.edu>
    
    A couple of drivers can sometimes fail the first segments in a bio then
    requeue the rest of the request.  In this situation, if the last part of
    the bio completes successfully bio_pair_end_* will miss that the beginging
    of the bio had failed becuase they just return one when bi_size is not yet
    zero.  The attached patch moves the error value test before the bi_size to
    catch the above case.

    [PATCH] Fix BLKPREP_KILL
    
    From: Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>
    
    Samuel Rydh wrote:
    
    If a MODE_SENSE(6) command is sent to an IDE cd using the CDROM_SEND_PACKET
    ioctl, then the kernel freezes solidly. To reproduce this, one can take the
    SCSI cmd [1a 08 31 00 10 00] and a 16 byte data buffer.
    
    After some bug hunting, I found out that the following is what happens:
    
    - ide-cd recognizes that MODE_SENSE(6) isn't supported and tries
      to abort the request from ide_cdrom_prep_pc by returning BLKPREP_KILL.
    
    - in elv_next_request(), the kill request is handled by
      the following code:
    
    	while (end_that_request_first(rq, 0, rq->nr_sectors))
    		;
    	end_that_request_last(rq);
    
    The while loop never exits. The end_that_request_first() doesn't do anything
    since rq->nr_sectors is 0; it just returns "not-done" after handling those 0
    bytes (rq->bio->bi_size is 16).

    [SPARC32]: Update module linking for symbols starting with "."
    
    Rusty did not like the __dot_sym approach and suggested instead:
    
    1) make rem, urem, mul, umul, div and udiv aliases to .rem, .urem etc:
    
       extern int rem(int, int) __attribute__((weak,alias(".rem")));
    
    2) EXPORT_SYMBOL(rem) etc.
    3) Check genksyms recognises that prototype (it should).
    4) Copy "dedotify" from ppc64 to handle them on load.
    
    The only real downside is the risk that someone else will export
    those names, but I think that's pretty unlikely.

    We've now narrowed down the issue of kernel oopses in combination with
    'LIST_DELETE' syslog messages happening in certain setups.
    
    Apparently people who do not enable CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT_LOCAL and do
    DNAT/REDIRECT and want to connect locally from the gateway via DNAT to
    the DNAT'ed address experience the bug ;)

    [PATCH] fix SATA simulation of 6-byte read/write
    
    Here's one for -rc...  either this bit is assumed on most modern drives,
    or nobody uses the 6-byte commands for read/write (which is very
    likely).  Either way it definitely wants fixing.
    
    Since we use the modern "LBA" method of addressing sectors, this bit
    must be present in the Device register when issuing a read or write.
    There are three code paths that need this bit, and only two of them
    actually set it.  This patch fixes the third (and apparently never used)
    code path.

    - Since the coherent DMA allocator is not currently compatible with
      HUGETLB, ensure that we fail at compile time should this option be

    - Move struct device/dma mask handling into consistent_alloc().
    - Complain if someone tries to allocate coherent memory larger than

    - Rename consistent_alloc() to __dma_alloc() to ensure that there
      is no confusion that consistent_alloc() has gone.
    - Ensure warnings and errors report the correct function name.

    [PATCH] inode dirtying timestamp fix
    
    It's a bit late in 2.6.5-rc for this, but it does fix a significant bug: for
    the first five minutes after boot, prior to the jiffy wrap, /bin/sync doesn't
    write all of the dirty data.
    
    We currently record an inode's time-of-first-dirtying in the address_space.
    This causes a few problems with dirty block special inodes: when the device
    node for /dev/hda1 needs to be written back we bogusly inspect the timestamp
    for the address_space, which belongs to a different inode.
    
    So move the inode's dirtying time up into the inode itself.
    
    This means that for block-special inodes, inode->dirtied_when represents the
    time at which the inode itself was dirtied.
    
    For regular files it represents the time at which the inode or its pages were
    dirtied.
    
    For blockdevs, the time-of-first-dirtying is recorded in the kernel-internal
    blockdev inode.  Only I_DIRTY_PAGES makes sense on these inodes.
    
    The reason all this works is that when dirtying a page we always run
    
    	__mark_inode_dirty(page->mapping->host);
    
    which refers to the kernel-internal blockdev inode.

    [PATCH] Fix slab creation/destruction vs. CPU Hotplug
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    From: Srivatsa Vaddagiri <vatsa@in.ibm.com>
    
    Hit a couple of (cpu hotplug) races in slab allocator during my tests.
    Mostly it was because of continuous loading/unloading fs/minix/minix.ko
    while simultaneously doing offline/online of CPUs.  As part of its init and
    exit routines, minix.ko create/destroys caches, which lead to several
    oopses.
    
    1. kmem_cache_create
    	In brief, kmem_cache_create does:
    		a) calls enable_cpucache to create per-cpu cache for all
    		   online CPUs.
    		b) adds the cache to the global list of caches
    
    	These two are not done atomically and thats what causes problems.
    
    	For ex: lets say that at the time of step a) CPU1 is not online.
    	Hence no per-cpu cache is created for CPU1 (cachep->array[1] is NULL).
    	However CPU1 is not completely dead in the sense that CPU_DEAD
    	processing for it is not yet over.  By the time CPU_DEAD processing
    	starts for CPU1, step b) is complete. So cpuup_callback finds this
    	cache and tries freeing it's per-cpu cache associated with CPU1.
    	In the process it dereferences a NULL pointer and dies.
    
    2. kmem_cache_destroy
    	In brief, kmem_cache_destroy does:
    		a) deletes the cache from the global list of caches
    		b) Drain per-cpu cache (drain_cpu_caches), which
    		   basically uses smp_call_function to run do_drain
    		   on all online CPUs.
    
    	One possible race is let's say that CPU1 is coming up.
    	By the time CPU_UP_PREPARE is processed for CPU1, step a) is
    	complete. Hence cpuup_callback does not allocate any per-cpu cache
    	for the cache that is being destroyed.
    
    	However by the time step b) is run, CPU1 is completely online
    	(taking interrupts). It receives the IPI and tries draining
    	it per-cpu cache (which is NULL) and dies there.
    
    I think we need to serialize kmem_cache_create/destroy against CPU hotplug
    to prevent these problems.  Patch below does that by taking CPU Hotplug sem
    (which is OK since kmem_cache_create/destroy are not very frequently
    used?).

    [PATCH] fix oops at pmac_zilog rmmod'ing
    
    From: Colin Leroy <colin@colino.net>
    
    rmmod'ing pmac_zilog currently oopses because uart_unregister_driver(),
    which nullifies drv->tty_driver, is called before uart_remove_one_port(),
    which uses said drv->tty_driver.
    
    The comment at top of uart_unregister_driver() specifically says we have
    to have removed all our ports via uart_remove_one_port() before.

    [PATCH] ppc64: syscall error test incorrect for 64 bits results
    
    The syscall return path on ppc64 checks if the error is between
    -LAST_ERRNO and 0, if it is, does the usual inversion along with
    setting a CR bit indicating to glibc that an error occured.
    
    However, we had an interesting bug where we used a 32 bits logica
    (unsigned) comparison, thus possibly doing false positives for
    valid 64 bits unsigned values whose low 32 bits happen to be in
    the error range.
    
    Fix that.

    [PATCH] Add BINFMT_MISC docs for Mono .NET-based binaries
    
    Just as there is documentation for BINFMT_MISC and Java bytecodes

    to add BINFMT_MISC support for directly running .NET ".exe" binaries
    using the Mono CLR.

    [PATCH] ppc32: More preempt fixes
    
    This patch fixes more cases of possible preempt issue when testing
    MSR for FP or VEC bits and then doing giveup_fpu or giveup_altivec
    that I missed in my previous round of fixes (bk get helps before
    grepping ;)
    
    I also change the single step and program check exceptions to not
    re-enable interrupts right away on C code entry, it was useless and
    would cause interesting issues with preempt & xmon

    A few asm/types.h test a config variable without including

    definitions. HFS fell victim to that and broke on ppc with CONFIG_LBD
    enabled. I scanned all asm/types.h and added <linux/config.h> as
    necessary.

    [PATCH] USB: Eliminate wait following interface unregistration
    
    This patch from Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu> fixes a bug in
    the current USB code that causes khubd to hang when a device is removed
    from the system, thereby preventing any future USB device changes (like
    adding or removing other devices) from happening.
    
    Both Andrew and I can easily duplicate this bug against the current -bk
    tree.
    
    It's not a perfect fix, but it works for now, and I will spend the next
    week working on restructuring the code so this is handled properly.

    [WATCHDOG] v2.6.5-rc2 pcwd.c-patch4
    
    Version 0.16 of pcwd.c - Changes that were made are:
    * Changed the driver so that it uses an internal timer to do
      the actual watchdog pinging. This way the watchdog's emulated
      'heartbeat' is usuable as a module parameter. The watchdog's
      heartbeat can now vary from 2 till 7200 seconds

    [SPARC32]: Rename cpuid functions
    
    smp_processor_id is to be used when current_thread_info()->cpu is
    valid; i.e. almost always.  Early on or when setting that field,
    hard_smp_processor_id is used.  Clarify the distinction and only
    export to modules what's really needed.  smp_processor_id is not
    model-specific, so we no longer need btfixups for it.

    [PATCH] Fix uninitialized data in EFI RTC /proc interface
    
    From: Bjorn Helgaas <bjorn.helgaas@hp.com>
    
    The problem is that we don't clear out the efi_time_t buffer before asking
    EFI to fill it in.  EFI doesn't always write the entire buffer (in
    particular, the alarm time only supports one second resolution, so the
    nanosecond field is often untouched).
    
    The effect is that 'cat /proc/driver/efirtc' shows garbage in the
    nanoseconds part of the alarm time, and sometimes artifacts like bogus
    alarm date and junk after the actual end of the text.

    [PATCH] selinux: check return value for receive node permission
    
    From: James Morris <jmorris@redhat.com>
    
    This patch fixes a bug where the return value for a permission call is not
    checked.
    
    The bug was introduced when I added some code in the following changeset:
    
    <http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/diffs/security/selinux/hooks.c@1.19?nav=index.html|src/|src/security|src/security/selinux|hist/security/selinux/hooks.c>
    
    Code was added after this line:
    
    	err = avc_has_perm(isec->sid, node_sid, SECCLASS_NODE, node_perm, NULL, &ad);
    
    without adding an explicit check of 'err', which was previously returned
    from the function rather than being checked.  i.e. it would drop through
    to:
    
    	out:
     		return err;
    
     	}
    
    With the new code added, err can (and typically would) be overwritten with
    a successful value, causing the permission check to not deny permission if
    needed.  The intended denial would have been logged.
    
    The patch below fixes this problem.

    from 232 to 157 cycles.  As a nice side-effect it simplified the uaccess
    functions considerably.

    [PATCH] s390: network driver.
    
    From: Martin Schwidefsky <schwidefsky@de.ibm.com>
    
    s390 network driver changes:
     - ctc/lcs/qeth: prevent a ccw-device to be grouped multiple times.
     - icuv: clear correct field in iucv_register_program if no userid is specified.
     - lcs: fix online/offline cycle again.
     - lcs: fix ungrouping of lcs group device. The channels of the lcs card
       should be offline afterwards.
     - lcs: don't do netif_stop_queue if no tx buffer is available, just
       return -EBUSY and drop the packets.

    [PATCH] s390: dasd driver.
    
    From: Martin Schwidefsky <schwidefsky@de.ibm.com>
    
    dasd device driver changes:
     - After a state change interrupt restart all running i/o on queue
       and reset device timer.
     - Improve some debug messages.
     - Lower timeout of reserve/release/steal_lock to 2 seconds.
     - Fix BIODASDPSRD ioctl.
     - Replace ro_flag, use_diag_flag and disconnect_error_flag words by bits.
     - Use BLKPG_DEL_PARTITION ioctl instead of a call to delete_partition because
       delete_partition is not an exported function. Since dasd_destroy_partitions
       can't do blkdev_get because dasd_open would fail, keep the block device
       open as long as partitions exist. This in turn requires a different
       approach to the open vs. offline race.

    -1 on a unsigned long) the "char_time" parameter passed to
    schedule_timeout().
    
    Fix that by making it a signed long, and checking for negative value.

    [ACPI] Linux specific updates from ACPICA 20040326
    "acpi_wake_gpes_always_on" boot flag for old GPE behaviour

commit ef84240dfd36e44e41f0ff648921cbd1e37ded98
Author: Len Brown <len.brown@intel.com>
Date:   Fri Mar 26 08:49:28 2004 -0500

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20040326 from Bob Moore
    
    Implemented support for "wake" GPEs via interaction between
    GPEs and the _PRW methods.  Every GPE that is pointed to by
    one or more _PRWs is identified as a WAKE GPE and by default
    will no longer be enabled at runtime.  Previously, we were
    blindly enabling all GPEs with a corresponding _Lxx or _Exx
    method - but most of these turn out to be WAKE GPEs anyway.
    We believe this has been the cause of thousands of
    "spurious" GPEs on some systems.
    
    This new GPE behavior is can be reverted to the original
    behavior (enable ALL GPEs at runtime) via a runtime flag.
    
    Fixed a problem where aliased control methods could not
    access objects properly.  The proper scope within the
    namespace was not initialized (transferred to the target of
    the aliased method) before executing the target method.
    
    Fixed a potential race condition on internal object
    deletion on the return object in AcpiEvaluateObject.
    
    Integrated a fix for resource descriptors where both
    _MEM and _MTP were being extracted instead of just _MEM.
    (i.e. bitmask was incorrectly too wide, 0x0F instead of 0x03.)
    
    Added a special case for ACPI_ROOT_OBJECT in AcpiUtGetNodeName,
    preventing a fault in some cases.
    
    Updated Notify() values for debug statements in evmisc.c
    
    Return proper status from AcpiUtMutexInitialize,
    not just simply AE_OK.

    [PATCH] ppc32: arch code preempt fixes
    
    I figured the best way to stop beeing bothered by users trying to run
    preempt was to fix it ;)
    
    Here's a first batch that close some races we had when testing regs->msr
    for altivec or FPU enable, then doing the giveup_* function.  A preempt
    in between those would have caused us to save a stale altivec or FPU
    context.

    [PATCH] dmasound close timeout
    
    The dmasound driver occasionally hangs a process on exit.
    
    Apparently there is a possible case where the sound HW stops draining
    output samples and the driver waits forever in its release() callback.
    It should check for signals(), but it seems signal_pending() never
    returns 1 when the process is beeing killed (implicit release() of files
    on exit).
    
    This patch adds a safety timeout to the release() function to make sure
    we can at least close the driver.  I'll try to find the reason we aren't
    driving samples later, but it is better to have a safety just incase the
    sound clock goes berserk for some reason.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Fix racy access to TI_FLAGS
    
    The ppc32 syscall entry code could access the thread info flags in a
    racy way, thus potentially losing bits sets there at interrupt time or
    by another CPU, like NEED_RESCHED or SIGPENDING (ouch !).
    
    This fixes it by moving the potentially racy bit to a different field (I
    preferred that rather than turning the access into an atomic operation
    for performances reasons).

    Anakin has not been maintained since it was (partially) merged, and
    the maintainers appear to ignore mail about it.  No one appears
    willing to maintain it either.  However, some unrelated kernel
    maintainers have been updating various files while they've been
    working in the area - which is wasted work for something which
    isn't maintained.
    
    Therefore, this cset removes Anakin completely from the kernel.

    Until that problem is identified and fixed, used the old PATA detection

    [PATCH] ppc64: SMT snooze fix in idle loop
    
    From: Olof Johansson <olof@austin.ibm.com>
    
    A smt_snooze_delay of 0 is supposed to mean "disabled", but current idle
    loop logic doesn't take that into account and snoozes immediately instead.
    
    Below patch fixes the logic in the idle loop, as well as cleans up the test
    a bit.  An idling processor might no longer see a snooze change
    immediately, but that's not needed anyway.

    glibc CVS expects this to be passed if we have a kernel version after

    JFS: don't use global lock in lmLogSync when local lock is sufficient
    
    I stupidly used the global jfs_log_sem to protect log->sb_list when
    implementing the shared journal stuff.  Since we already hold
    LOG_LOCK, it makes more sense to use that to protect log->sb_list.
    This caused horrible serialization when running on lots of jfs
    volumes.

    [PATCH] ia64: fix name conflict with handle_exception()
    
    I tried to build usb/gadget/file_storage.c (CONFIG_USB_FILE_STORAGE=y),
    but it uses "handle_exception()" for its own purposes, which conflicts
    with the ia64 definition.  ia64 only uses handle_exception() within
    arch code, so it seems like we ought to rename it to be ia64-specific.
    done_with_exception() looks similar, so I renamed it as well, although
    there's no actual conflict.

    [PATCH] fix ppc32 sys_swapcontext
    
    This fixes a bug in the swapcontext system call on ppc32.
    
    On ppc32, the system call entry only saves the volatile registers,
    except in the case of a few system calls (e.g.  fork) which need all the
    registers saved.  Swapcontext needs all the registers but we weren't
    saving them all. So fixes that.

    core dumps properly.

    [PATCH] fbcon font cloning fix
    
    From: Petr Baudis <pasky@ucw.cz>
    
    This patch fixes a bug which I hit when migrating from 2.4.  Basically,
    when I do setfont during the system boot, the then-spawned ttys do not
    retain the new font but fall back to the default one.
    
    I've tracked that down to a clearly bogus test in fbcon_set_display(),
    because vc->vc_font.width is not set at that time yet (no font has been
    loaded for the new vc).  But even if it would (or this was meant to test
    against tmp->vc_font.width), it would mean only *HUGE* fonts would be
    retained.  And even if there were *two* bugs there and it was supposed to
    be less-than there, I couldn't make a sense of the test.

    [PATCH] Work around compiler error in proc_misc.c
    
    From: Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu>
    
    A change which was recently applied to fs/proc/proc_misc.c included a comment
    about splitting a seq_printf into two pieces to work around a bug in
    gcc-2.95.3.  Unfortunately gcc-2.96 still chokes on the statements.  The
    patch below makes it work better and tidies the code up a bit.

    [PATCH] sh: hugetlb support
    
    From: Paul Mundt <lethal@linux-sh.org>
    
    This implements hugetlb support for SH-4.  SH-4 supports 1k/4k/64k/1MB pages,
    since we're only interested in the 64k/1MB sizes, this is what we support.
    
    The sh hugetlbpage code borrows heavily off of the sparc64 port, which works
    fine for these cases at this point in time.

    [PATCH] sh: port sh-sci driver to the new API
    
    From: Paul Mundt <lethal@linux-sh.org>
    
    This ports the sh-sci driver to the new API.  sh and h8 both use this.  The
    intention is to leave the drivers/char sh-sci in place for a short period of
    time until all the h8 people are on the new driver (sh no longer uses the
    drivers/char version).

    instead of the defconfig-board format that sh was using before.  Since Sam
    Ravnborg already added the automated archhelp stuff that sh was using to the
    top-level Makefile, the sh version can be killed off.

    This adds __kcrctab to the discard list for the link script for the boot
    wrapper, and is needed if you compile with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS.
    
    With this patch applied, we need to update makefile dependencies.  Otherwise
    the bootfiles will remain untouched because they do not depend on the changed
    linker script.

    [PATCH] ISDN Eicon driver: fix compilation with non __exit function
    
       Function divacapi_remove_cards() is now used for __init as well,
       so it may not be marked __exit.

    [CRYPTO]: Add Michael MIC algorithm.
    
    From Jouni Malinen <jkmaline@cc.hut.fi>
    
    Added Michael MIC keyed digest for TKIP (IEEE 802.11i/WPA). This algorithm
    is quite weak due to the requirements for compatibility with old legacy
    wireless LAN hardware that does not have much CPU power. Consequently, this
    should not really be used with anything else than TKIP.
    
    Michael MIC is calculated over the payload of the IEEE 802.11 header which
    makes it easier to add TKIP support for old wireless LAN cards. An additional
    authenticated data area is used (but not send separately) to authenticate
    source and destination addresses.

    [CRYPTO]: Add setkey operation for digests.
    
    From Jouni Malinen <jkmaline@cc.hut.fi>
    
    Added support for using keyed digest with an optional dit_setkey handler.
    This does not change the behavior of the existing digest algorithms, but
    allows new ones to add setkey handler that can be used to initialize the
    algorithm with a key or seed. setkey is to be called after init, but before
    any of the update call(s).

    [PATCH] Revert UDF inode semaphore locking
    
    For some reason I don't understand, the last UDF filesystem update makes
    the UDF deadlock when I write a bunch of mp3 files to a CDRW using the
    packet writing patch.  Both "cp" and pdflush get stuck in __down.
    
    Reverting the semaphore changes makes the problem go away.  Use the
    kernel lock again, until whatever recursive offender gets fixed.
    
    (The offensive recursion seems to be: write() takes the inode semaphore,
    causes memory pressure, and then trying to write back the inode or dirty
    data to disk tries to get the semaphore again and deadlocks.)

    [PATCH] kbuild ordering fix
    
    From: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>
    
    In the i386 case we need to generate asm-offset.h, before starting building
    the kernel tree.  Building asm-offset.h causes us to use one of the
    shorthands in the top-level makefile, namely the one for .s files.  The one
    that allows us to do: make some/dir/file.s
    
    And this shorthand happens to have a dependency to scripts, therefore I did
    not see this problem on i386.  But David hit it with sparc64, because there
    is no asm-offset.h file.  No parallel stuff involved here, just an ordinary
    error.

    [PATCH] Hack mptfusion to work on >4GB machines
    
    fusion needs several separately allocated coherent regions and
    requires that they all be in the same 4GB segment.  Obviously this may
    fail.  The hack is to force the coherent_dma_mask to 0xffffffff thus

    [PATCH] clean up ACPI GSI/IRQ conversions (i386 part)
    
    Add "acpi_gsi_to_irq()" as a generic replacement for "acpi_irq_to_vector()".
    This converts from an ACPI global system interrupt number to a Linux IRQ.
    Also, convert i386-specific terminology to use GSI when appropriate.

    [PATCH] keywest bugfix
    
    This fixes a deadlock in I2C probing.
    
     - keywest holds the pmac_low_i2c_lock while registering the i2c adapter.
     - i2c_add_adapter() notifies registered drivers by calling
       driver->attach_adapter().
     - a driver might access the i2c bus from attach_adapter() which
       deadlocks since all xfer routines take the lock.

    [PATCH] fix console oops/race
    
    Finally nailed this sucker.
    
    con_close() checks the tty->count and then sleeps in acquire_console_sem().
    But another process can come in and grab a ref against the tty while
    con_close() dropped the BKL.  But con_close() then proceeds to deallocate the
    tty->driver_data anyway, even though the tty now has ->count == 2.
    
    Fix that by moving the check for ->tty_count inside console_sem.

    [PATCH] critical x86-64 merge
    
    There were some nasty bugs in the x86-64 code, including one race that
    could cause random reboots, especially on Intel machines, with the NMI
    watchdog.  This patch fixes them and also includes some harmless
    cleanups.
    
    Main fixes were for some buglets in the IOMMU code and the plugging of a
    race in the exception stack handling.  Also disables an broken MCE on K8
    explicitely.
    
    Also finally the preempt compile issues are fixed.
    
     - Declare hpet interrupt separately in drivers/char/rtc.c
     - Fix rtc.h/hpet.h to not depend on interrupt.h
     - Finally include smp_lock.h in hardirq.h
     - Update defconfig
     - Export bad_dma_address
     - Merge with 2.6.5rc2
     - Never schedule on interrupt stacks.
     - Add option to force software iotlb (iommu=soft)
     - Add ifdefs to gsi patch to match i386 (Bjorn Helgaas)
     - Fix K8 GART TLB MCE workaround to actually work
     - Fix dwarf2 unwind table in SAVE_ARGS (Jim Houston)
     - Disable APIC on VIA/NVidia even with acpi=off (Gwenole Beauchesne)
     - Fix parsing bug in "apic" option (Gwenole Beauchesne)
     - Fix dma mask handling in pci_alloc_consistent

     - Print version number in oopses (from i386)
     - ACPI GSI cleanup (Bjorn Helgaas)
     - Disable K8 GART TLB walk error MCE explicitely

    Some isapnp devices were not getting detected as a result of a bug in the isapnp

    <rogerspl@datasync.com>.  He made an initial patch.  This release has some small
    modifications, including a check to see if we run out of CSNs.

    [PATCH] PCI: Use insert_resource in pci_claim_resource
    
    On ia64, the parent resources are not necessarily PCI resources and
    so won't get found by pci_find_parent_resource.  Use the shiny new
    insert_resource() function instead, which I think we would have used
    here had it been available at the time.

    tailcall here?

    scsi.c: drain dead cpu's scsi_done_q onto this cpu.
    
    buffer.c: brelse the bh_lrus queue for dead cpu.
    
    timer.c: migrate timers from dead cpu, being careful of lock order vs
    	__mod_timer.
    
    radix_tree.c: free dead cpu's radix_tree_preloads
    
    page_alloc.c: empty dead cpu's nr_pagecache_local into nr_pagecache, and
    	free pages on cpu's local cache.
    
    slab.c: stop reap_timer for dead cpu, adjust each cache's free limit, and
    	free each slab cache's per-cpu block.
    
    swap.c: drain dead cpu's lru_add_pvecs into ours, and empty its committed_space
    	counter into global counter.
    
    dev.c: drain device queues from dead cpu into this one.
    
    flow.c: drain dead cpu's flow cache.

    the kswapd back onto its node.

    [PATCH] Hotplug CPUs: Workqueue Changes
    
    Workqueues need to bring up/destroy the per-cpu thread on cpu up/down.
    
    1) Add a global list of workqueues, and keep the name in the structure
       (to name the newly created thread).
    
    2) Remove BUG_ON in run_workqueue, since thread is dragged off CPU when
       it goes down.
    
    3) Lock out cpu up/down in flush_workqueue, create_workqueue and
       destroy_workqueue.
    
    4) Add notifier to add/destroy workqueue threads, and take over work.

    [PATCH] Hotplug CPUs: Make ksoftirqd Handle CPU Going Down
    
    Change ksoftirqd not to assume it's on the CPU: when a cpu goes down,
    it will be rudely dragged off.  Since do_softirq() uses
    smp_processor_id(), it's easiest to disable preemption, check that the
    cpu is still up, then call do_softirq().
    
    If the cpu is actually offline, wait for the notifier, which kills us.
    
    Take over tasklets from dead cpu in the notifier.
    
    Clean up redundant double assignment in CPU_UP callback.

    Change the migration thread to directly use its cpu arg, rather than
    smp_processor_id(): if a cpu goes up then down rapidly, it can be on
    the wrong cpu just before it is stopped.
    
    Add code to stop the migration thread on CPU_DEAD and CPU_UP_CANCELED.
    
    Remove the (bogus) priority of the notifier.

    [PATCH] Hotplug CPUs: Set prio of migration thread before CPU
    
    We need the migration thread to be RT as soon as the CPU comes online:
    for example, stop_machine() (another RT task) expects to yield to it.
    Extract the core of setscheduler() and do that when the migration
    thread is created.  rq lock is a precaution against the (theoretical)
    possibility of someone else doing setscheduer on this thread at the
    same time.

    [PATCH] Hotplug CPUs: Keep IRQs off in Migration Thread Calling
    
    Currently the migration thread re-enables irqs, then calls
    move_task_away which disables IRQs again and actually does the move.
    This means there is a race where the migration thread gets preempted,
    and the target CPU can go down.
    
    Hold irqs disabled in migration thread across move_task_away(), which
    now doesn't need to save flags (the other caller is the hotplug CPU
    code, where irqs are also disabled).

    [PATCH] Hotplug CPUs: Take cpu Lock Around Migration
    
    Grab cpu lock around sched_migrate_task() and sys_sched_setaffinity().
    This is a noop without CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU.
    
    The sched_migrate_task may have a performance penalty on NUMA if lots
    of exec rebalancing is happening, however this only applies to
    CONFIG_NUMA and CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU, which noone does at the moment
    anyway.
    
    Also, the scheduler in -mm solves the race another way, so this will
    vanish then.

    Note that cpu_is_offline() is a noop when CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n.

    Whole thing under CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU, so doesn't break archs which
    don't define that.

    [PATCH] remove_suid() should return error code
    
    From: Nikita Danilov <Nikita@Namesys.COM>
    
    remove_suid() ignores return value of notify_change()->i_op->setattr().
    This mean, that even if file system fails to clear suid bit,
    generic_file_aio_write_nolock() proceeds with write, which is unsafe.
    
    Actually, even ext2's ->setattr() can fail, when trying to update ACL, for
    example.
    
    Attached patch modifies remove_suid() to return result of ->setattr(), and
    updates in-tree callers.

    it up to lawyers to determine what other appropriate license could be used
    for a new driver.

    This patch was needed against a pristine 2.6.4 kernel when compiling with

    Without this patch, modules would use a non-inline memcmp() and then not
    find it in the kernel, causing depmod to complain and some modules not to
    load.

    [PATCH] ip2: fix double operator
    
    From: "Randy.Dunlap" <rddunlap@osdl.org>
    
    This trivial patch fixes the bug #320:
    
    http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=320
    
    The additional comment:
    
    http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=320#c1
    
    Is wrong, because it will send the command twice.
    
    We only want to see if the command got success, thus is not necessary
    to test against < 0 (if the return value is not 1, we got a error).
    
    Note that I'm using the function (bad) style.

    [PATCH] config: choice fix
    
    From: Roman Zippel <zippel@linux-m68k.org>
    
    When a boolean choice value has a dependency of 'm' it can be shortly
    treated as a tristate symbol.  This fixes this and also add a small
    optimization to precompute the value of the module symbol instead of
    checking it all the time.

    [PATCH] sysfs: pin kobjects to fix use-after-free crashes
    
    From: Maneesh Soni <maneesh@in.ibm.com>
    
    Fix a sysfs use-after-free crash.  The problem we have is of the kobject
    going away while we have a live dentry (the corresponding sysfs directory)
    still pointing to it throuh d_fsdata pointer.  The patch makes sure to keep
    the kobject alive by taking a reference to it during the life-time of
    corresponding dentry.
    
    
    o The following pins the kobject when sysfs assigns dentry and inode to
      the kobject. This ensures that kobject is alive during the life time of
      the dentry and inode, and people holding ref. to the dentry can access the
      kobject without any problems.
    
    o The ref. taken for the kobject is released through dentry->d_op->d_iput()
      call when the dentry ref. count drops to zero and it is being freed. For
      this sysfs_dentry_operations is introduced.
    
    For testing one has to run the following test on a SMP box:
    
    1) Do insmod/rmmod "dummy.o" network driver in a forever loop.
    
    2) Parallely do "find /sys/class/net | xargs cat" also in a forever loop.

    [PATCH] Fix dentry refcounting in sysfs_remove_group()
    
    From: Maneesh Soni <maneesh@in.ibm.com>
    
    The following patch fixes the dentry refcounting, during
    sysfs_remove_group() and also adds the missing dput() for the "extra" ref
    taken during sysfs_create() for the sub-directory dentry corresponding to
    attribute group.

    [PATCH] sysfs_remove_dir-vs-dcache_readdir race fix
    
    From: Maneesh Soni <maneesh@in.ibm.com>
    
    I have re-done the patch fixing the race between sysfs_remove_dir() and
    dcache_readdir().  If you recall, sysfs_remove_dir(kobj) manipulates the
    ->d_subdirs list for the dentry corresponding to the sysfs directory being
    removed.  It can end up deleting the cursor dentry which is added to the
    ->d_subdirs list during a concurrent dcache_dir_open() ==> dcache_readdir()
    for the same directory.  And as a result dcache_readdir() can loop for ever
    holding dcache_lock.
    
    The earlier patch which was included in -mm1 created problems which
    resulted in list_del() BUG hits in prune_dcache().  The reason I think is
    that in the main loop in sysfs_remove_dir(), dcache_lock is dropped and
    re-acquired, and this could result in inconsistent ->d_subdirs list and
    prune_dcache() may try to delete an already deleted dentry.  I have
    corrected this in the new patch as below.
    
    I could do sysfs_remove_dir() more neatly on sysfs backing store patch set
    as there I don't use the ->d_subdirs list.  Instead the list of children
    sysfs_dirent works out well.  But untill sysfs backing store patch is
    picked up the existing code suffer from this race.  This can be easily
    tested by running following two loops on a SMP box
    
    # while true; do insmod drivers/net/dummy.ko; rmmod dummy; done
    # while true; do find /sys/class/net > /dev/null; done
    
    
    o This patch fixes sysfs_remove_dir race with dcache_readdir.  There is
      no need for sysfs_remove_dir to modify the d_subdirs list for the
      directory being deleted as it is taken care in the final dput.  Modifying
      this list results in inconsistent d_subdirs list and causes infinite loop
      in concurrently occurring dcache_readdir.
    
    o The main loop is restarted every time, dcache_lock is re-acquired in
      order to maintain consistency.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix SLB reload bug
    
    From: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>
    
    Recently we found a particularly nasty bug in the segment handling in the
    ppc64 kernel.  It would only happen rarely under heavy load, but when it
    did the machine would lock up with the whole of memory filled with
    exception stack frames.
    
    The primary cause was that we were losing the translation for the kernel
    stack from the SLB, but we still had it in the ERAT for a while longer.
    Now, there is a critical region in various exception exit paths where we
    have loaded the SRR0 and SRR1 registers from GPRs and we are loading those
    GPRs and the stack pointer from the exception frame on the kernel stack.
    If we lose the ERAT entry for the kernel stack in that region, we take an
    SLB miss on the next access to the kernel stack.  Taking the exception
    overwrites the values we have put into SRR0 and SRR1, which means we lose
    state.  In fact we ended up repeating that last section of the exception
    exit path, but using the user stack pointer this time.  That caused another
    exception (or if it didn't, we loaded a new value from the user stack and
    then went around and tried to use that).  And it spiralled downwards from
    there.
    
    The patch below fixes the primary problem by making sure that we really
    never cast out the SLB entry for the kernel stack.  It also improves
    debuggability in case anything like this happens again by:
    
    - In our exception exit paths, we now check whether the RI bit in the
      SRR1 value is 0.  We already set the RI bit to 0 before starting the
      critical region, but we never checked it.  Now, if we do ever get an
      exception in one of the critical regions, we will detect it before
      returning to the critical region, and instead we will print a nasty
      message and oops.
    
    - In the exception entry code, we now check that the kernel stack pointer
      value we're about to use isn't a userspace address.  If it is, we print a
      nasty message and oops.
    
    This has been tested on G5 and pSeries (both with and without hypervisor)
    and compile-tested on iSeries.

    [PATCH] hpfs: fix locking scheme
    
    	Fixed the locking scheme.  The need of extra locking was caused by
    the fact that hpfs_write_inode() must update directory entry; since HPFS
    directories are implemented as b-trees, we must provide protection both
    against rename() (to make sure that we update the entry in right directory)
    and against rebalancing of the parent.
    
    	Old scheme had both deadlocks and races - to start with, we had no
    protection against rename()/unlink()/rmdir(), since (a) locking parent
    was done without any warranties that it will remain our parent and (b)
    check that we still have a directory entry (== have positive nlink) was
    done before we tried to lock the parent.  Moreover, iget serialization
    killed two steps ago gave immediate deadlocks if iget() of parent had
    triggered another hpfs_write_inode().
    
    	New scheme introduces another per-inode semaphore (hpfs-only,
    obviously) protecting the reference to parent.  It's taken on
    rename/rmdir/unlink victims and inode being moved by rename.  Old semaphores
    are taken only on parent(s) and only after we grab one(s) of the new kind.
    hpfs_write_inode() gets the new semaphore on our inode, checks nlink and
    if it's non-zero grabs parent and takes the old semaphore on it.
    
    	Order among the semaphores of the same kind is arbitrary - the only
    function that might take more than one of the same kind is hpfs_rename()
    and it's serialized by VFS.
    
    	We might get away with only one semaphore, but then the ordering
    issues would bite us big way - we would have to make sure that child is
    always locked before parent (hpfs_write_inode() leaves no other choice)
    and while that's easy to do for almost all operations, rename() is a bitch -
    as always.  And per-superblock rwsem giving rename() vs. write_inode()
    exclusion on hpfs would make the entire thing too baroque for my taste.
    	->readdir() takes no locks at all (protection against directory
    modifications is provided by VFS exclusion), ditto for ->lookup().
    	->llseek() on directories switched to use of (VFS) ->i_sem, so
    it's safe from directory modifications and ->readdir() is safe from it -
    no hpfs locks are needed here.

    [PATCH] hpfs: deadlock fixes
    
    We used to have GFP_KERNEL kmalloc() done by the code that held hpfs
    lock on directory.  That could trigger a call of hpfs_write_inode() and
    deadlock; fixed by switch to GFP_NOFS.  Same for hpfs inodes themselves
    - hpfs_write_inode() calls iget() and that could trigger both the
    deadlocks (avoidable with very baroque locking scheme) and stack
    overflows (unavoidable unless we kill potential recursion here).

    [PATCH] hpfs: hpfs iget locking cleanup
    
    Killed the nightmares in hpfs iget handling.  Since in some (fairly
    frequent) cases hpfs_read_inode() could avoid any IO (basically, lookup
    hitting a native HPFS regular file can get all data from directory
    entry) hpfs had a flag passed to that sucker.  Said flag had been
    protected by a semaphore lookalike made out of spit and duct-tape and
    callers of iget looked like
    
    	hpfs_lock_iget(sb, flag);
    	result = iget(sb, ino);
    	hpfs_unlock_iget(sb);
    
    Since now we are calling hpfs_read_inode() directly (note that calling
    it without hpfs_lock_iget() would simply break) we can forget all that
    crap and get rid of the flag - caller knows what it wants to call.
    
    BTW, that had killed one of the last sleep_on() users in fs/*/*.

    [PATCH] hpfs: new/read/write_inode() cleanups
    
    	1) common initialization for all paths in hpfs_read_inode() taken into
    a separate helper (hpfs_init_inode())
    	2) hpfs mkdir(),create(),mknod() and symlink() do not bother with
    iget() anymore - they call new_inode(), do initializations and insert new
    inode into icache.  Handling of OOM failures cleaned up - if we can't
    allocate in-core inode, bail instead of corrupting the filesystem.
    Allocating in-core inode early also avoids one of the deadlocks here
    (hpfs_write_inode() from memory pressure by kmem_cache_alloc() could
    deadlock on attempt to lock our directory).
    	3) hpfs_write_inode() marks the inode dirty again in case if it
    fails to iget() its parent directory.  Again, OOM could trigger fs corruption
    here.

    	hpfs_{lock,unlock}_{2,3}inodes() killed; all places that take more than

    locks are of the same type.  IOW, we can replace these guys with multiple
    hpfs_lock_inode() - order doesn't matter here.

    [PATCH] exportfs - Remove unnecessary locking from find_exported_dentry()
    
    From: "Jose R. Santos" <jrsantos@austin.ibm.com>
    
    After discussing it with Neil, he fell that the original justification for
    taking the kernel_lock on find_exported_dentry() is not longer valid and
    should be safe to remove.
    
    This patch fixes an issue while running SpecSFS where under memory
    pressure, shrinking dcache cause find_exported_dentry() to allocate
    disconnected dentries that later needed to be properly connected.  The
    connecting part of the code was done with BKL taken which cause a sharp

    now with no problems using ext2, ext3, xfs and jfs.

    From: Robert Love <rml@ximian.com>
    
    arch/ppc64/Kconfig's entry for CONFIG_PREEMPT is missing the description
    after the "bool" statement, so the entry does not show up.
    
    Also, the help description mentions a restriction that is not [any longer]
    true.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Fix booting some IBM PRePs
    
    From: Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
    
    The following patch comes from Paul Mackerras.  Earlier on in 2.6,
    arch/ppc/boot/utils/mkprep.c was changed slightly so that it would build
    and work on Solaris.  Doing this required changing from filling out
    pointers to an area to filling out a local copy of the struct.  However, a
    memcpy was left out, and the info is only needed on some machines to boot.
    The following adds in the missing memcpy and allows for IBM PRePs to boot
    from a raw floppy again.

    2.4 kernel doesn't shadow this register at all, so I removed
    shadowing from 2.6 as well.

    [PATCH] ia64: force all kernel sections into one and the same segment
    
    Older versions of the linker do not handle cross-segment segment-relative
    relocations properly.  This becomes a real problem when the linker decides
    to put .text and .text.init into different segments (for whatever reasons)
    because in that case, broken linkers will produce a broken unwind section,
    which can cause nasty Heisenbugs, where, for example, unwinding may or may
    not work depending on the exact value of the IP in a function.

    acpi_bus_receive_event() had code that would trigger this issue.
    Fix by declaring r13 as a global register variable.

    	to subioctls.
    	* isl_oid.h (dot11_[maxframeburst|preamblesettings|
    	slotsettings|nonerpstatus|nonerpprotection]_t): added.
    	Note: more ioctls can be added here, I believe problems
    	with mixed modes can be pinpointed here, with these values.

    The current Linux implementation of shmat() insists on SHMLBA alignment even
    when shmflg & SHM_RND == 0.  This is not consistent with the man pages and
    the single UNIX spec, which require only a page-aligned address.
    
    However, some architectures require a SHMLBA alignment for correctness in all
    cases.  Such architectures use __ARCH_FORCE_SHMLBA.

    hard coded 256 minor in it.  Here is a patch that fix this problem by using
    register_chrdev_region() and cdev_(init/add/del) functions.

    [PATCH] x86 vsyscall alignment fix
    
    From: Andy Whitcroft <andyw@uk.ibm.com>
    
    The vsyscall implementation for ia32 provides two different vsyscall pages;
    one to use int80 and the other to use sysenter.  Each includes a common
    signal trailer.  The kernel requires the alignment of routines in this
    trailer be consistent in both copies.  However this is not enforced at
    compile time.  Failure to maintain this alignment typically leads to an
    obscure SIGSEGV in init during boot.  This critical alignment requirement
    is not well documented.
    
    Below is a patch to better document the alignment requirements and to
    enforce the requirement.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Fix PCI DMA API changes
    
    From: Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
    
    When Dave Miller updated <asm-ppc/pci.h> for the _for_device and _for_cpu
    portions of the PCI DMA API, he assumed that on PPC32 consistent_sync*
    would also need to be changed for device or cpu.  This is not the case, so
    what this does is the pci_*_for_{cpu,device} calls call
    consistent_sync{,page} again.

    [netdrvr natsemi] Fix RX DMA mapping
    
    RX skbs are always considered maximally sized, until actual reception
    of the RX frame occurs.  So, update this driver to always map and
    unmap a maximally sized skb.  This fixes this driver on several
    non-x86 platforms.

    [PATCH] ide-scsi.c: fix ATAPI multi-lun support
    
    ATAPI multi-lun support has been broken for a long time.
    
    It used to be that "(drive->id->last_id & 0x7) + 1" was used as
    shost->max_lun and the "hdXlun=" kernel parameter could be used to
    override this value.
    
    However it was far from optimal:
    - people played with "hdXlun=" and then complained about multiple instances
      of the same device (most ATAPI drives respond to each LUN)
    - probably some devices return 7 not 0 in id->last_id (=> 7 x same device)
    
    This patch from Willem Riede <wrlk@riede.org> fixes it w/o need
    for "hdXlun=" option.  It was tested by Willem on ATAPI PD/CD drive.

    [PATCH] wait_task_inactive should not return on preempt
    
    wait_task_inactive is now only used in two non-time-critical places: the
    ptrace code to guarantee a schedule and kthread_bind so we can change
    the thread CPU.  Unfortunately with preempt, the code as stands has a
    race: we might return because the thread is preempted, not because it
    actually reached schedule().  The ptrace code (probably) doesn't care,
    but the kthread code does.
    
    This patch simplifies the (now over-optimized) code, and does a yield()
    for the preemption case.

    [PATCH] ppc64: fix for massive OF properties
    
    From: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>
    
    We have some versions of firmware out there that have huge OF properties.
    So huge that we end up overwriting our initrd.
    
    Place a 1MB limit and warn bitterly if its over this.  Also fix a use of
    package-to-path where the variable was 64bytes but we would pass in a
    length of 255.

    [PATCH] Cleanup ppc64 procfs code
    
    From: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>
    
    Cleanup ppc64 procfs code:
    
    - Use initcalls everywhere. This allowed us to remove the iseries proc
      callback interface.
    - Kill proc_pmc.c. Most of it wasnt used (and we are planning to export the
      PMCs via sysfs). The few things left were iseries specific so they
      got moved into iSeries_proc.c.
    - Kill pmc.c. We dont use those statistics and the ones that are left
      can be gained via PMCs.
    - Create /proc/iSeries and /proc/ppc64 very early. This means we no
      longer have to call proc_ppc64_init in all the drivers, we can
      assume its there.
    - Fix some error return cases in rtas-proc.c and rtas-flash
    - Dont even try some pseries specific drivers on pmac.

    if take a miss on the radix tree.  This is possible, when an
    interrupt is taken before the driver has called request_irq() (eg IDE).

    - Merge some whitespace differences with the ameslab tree
    - We check for CPU_MASK_ALL in xics to send irqs to all cpus.
      In some cases CPU_MASK_ALL is smaller than the cpumask (eg
      NR_CPUS == 32 and cpumask is a long), so we mask it here to
      be consistent.

    [PATCH] Fix multiple EEH-related bugs
    
    From: Linas Vepstas <linas@austin.ibm.com>
    
    This patch fixes multiple EEH-related bugs:
    
     - Fixes the eeh_check_failure() usage in an interrupt context.
       This routine is now safe to use in an interrupt. The fix was to
       build a cache of IO addresses and check that, instead of using
       the pci routines.
     - Merges in Olof Johansson's sizeof patch when checking for failure
     - Adds EEH tests to array/string reads
     - Fixes bugs with address resolution (some i/o addresses were handled
       incorrectly, resulting in EEH errors slipping by undetected.)
     - Adds EEH support to the PCI Hotplug system (so that devices that
       get added/removed get properly registered with the EEH subsystem.)
     - Fixes improper use of /proc filesystem.
     - Adds some misc statistics.
    
    While merging Linas' patch I also converted the proc usage to
    seq_single, used per cpu variables for the stats and removed the
    eeh-force-off option.

    	have "interrupts".
    3. change of_remove_node to non-recurisve func. The recursions will be done
    	by the caller.
    4. add a new function -- of_finish_dynamic_node_interrupts()

    From: Rick Lindsley <ricklind@us.ibm.com>
    
    Fix bug #2230.
    
    I've corresponded with the submitter and he did find a real bug -- when we
    were merging I/O requests we didn't always take the oldest request start
    time, which would cause a couple of the calculations like wait time and
    average queue size to be too small.  He found it mathematically but having
    done so, I think logic and inspection makes it easy to verify.

    This also saves 4k when we use 4k stacks.  Please apply.  Couple more minor
    pieces remaining.

    - Return correct value from kmem writes() when a fault is encountered.  A
      write()-style syscall's return values are:
    
       0 when nothing was written and there was no error (someone tried to
       write zero bytes)
    
       >0: the number of bytes copied, whether or not there was an error.
       Userspace detects errors by noting that the write() return value is less
       than was requested.
    
       <0: there was an error and no bytes were copied

    perform direct-io on a tail.  bh_result->b_page == NULL, which causes the
    PageLocked and PageWriteback checks to perform a NULL deref, causing the
    oops.

    [PATCH] fbdev: character drawing enhancement.
    
    From: James Simmons <jsimmons@infradead.org>
    
    This patch merges two of the drawing functions.  The patch uses aligned
    transfers when possible even on displays where the characters are not byte
    align.  Tested on my my laptop for 12 bit width fonts and 8 bit wide fonts.
    It works very nicely.

    [PATCH] page_referenced() simplification
    
    There's no point in calling mark_page_accessed() here.  The page is never on
    the LRU so all mark_page_accessed() will do is to set PG_referenced, which we
    immediately clear again.

    [PATCH] flush_scheduled_work() deadlock fix
    
    Because keventd is a resource which is shared between unrelated parts of the
    kernel it is possible for one person's workqueue handler to accidentally call
    another person's flush_scheduled_work().  thockin managed it by calling
    mntput() from a workqueue handler.  It deadlocks.
    
    It's simple enough to fix: teach flush_scheduled_work() to go direct when it
    discovers that the calling thread is the one which should be running the
    work.
    
    Note that this can cause recursion.  The depth of that recursion is equal to
    the number of currently-queued works which themselves want to call
    flush_scheduled_work().  If this ever exceeds three I'll eat my hat.

    From: Stephen Smalley <sds@epoch.ncsc.mil>
    
    This patch fixes a bug in the SELinux compute_av code; the current code
    yields the right access computation but can cause unnecessary (but
    harmless) processing to occur when transition permission wasn't granted in
    the first place by the TE configuration.  Thanks to Chad Hanson of TCS for
    reporting the bug.

    [PATCH] kbuild: fix modpost when used with O=
    
    From: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>
    
    modpost or to be more specific sumversion.c was not behaving correct when
    used with O= and MODULE_VERSION was used.  Previously it failed to use
    local .h when calculation the md-sum in case of a O= build.
    
    The following patch introduces the following:
    
    - A generic get_next_line()
    
    - Check that the topmost part of the directory matches
    
    - Using strrch when checking for file with suffix .o
    
    - Use NOFAIL for allocations in sumversion
    
    - Avoid memory leak in new_module
    
    The generic get_next_line will pay off when Andreas implmentation of
    storing symbol addresses in a seperate file is introduced.

    [PATCH] ide-scsi error handling fixes
    
    From: Willem Riede <wrlk@riede.org>
    
    The patch revises the error handling in ide-scsi, fixing the scheduling
    while locked issues, and make it work properly, at least for me...
    
    Specific changes in this patch:
    
    - introduce idescsi_expiry, a timeout routine for the ide subsystem,
      which simply flags the fact that the command timed out, but postpones
      any other action until either the command still finishes on its own
      (unlikely?) or the scsi error handler kicks in;
    
    - introduce idescsi_atapi_error and idescsi_atapi_abort, error routines
      for the ide subsystem, which are modeled after those of ide-cd, but
      take only minimal effort to recover, leaving the heavy lifting for
      the scsi error handler;
    
    - rewrite (and rename for clarity) idescsi_eh_abort and idescsi_eh_error,
      the abort/error routines to be called by the scsi error handler --
      this redesign should not have the scheduling while atomic problems
      of the old implementation.
    
    - move ide_cdrom_dump_status() from ide-cd.c to ide-lib.c as
      ide_dump_atapi_status() and both ide-cd and ide-scsi call it.
    
    - replaces BUG() by WARN_ON()/printk in the error handling code.
    
    - sets TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE before schedule_timeout() and moves the host
      unlock/lock around the while loop inside the loop in idescsi_eh_reset().

    [PATCH] selinux: Conditional policy extension and MLS detection support
    
    From: Stephen Smalley <sds@epoch.ncsc.mil>
    
    This patch extends the SELinux policy engine to support conditional policy
    logic based on a set of policy booleans, allowing well-formed changes to
    the policy to be defined within and mediated by the policy itself.
    
    The conditional policy extensions were implemented and contributed by
    Tresys Technology.
    
    Userland packages that support these extensions are already available from
    nsa.gov/selinux, and backward compatibility is provided for the prior
    policy version.
    
    The patch also includes a small change to enable detection of the optional
    MLS policy model on a SELinux system and fixes to the conditional policy
    extensions to allow the MLS policy to work correctly with them that were
    implemented and contributed by Trusted Computer Solutions.

    [PATCH] Fix early parallel make failures
    
    From: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>
    
    Ingo said:
    
      Starting at around 2.6.4-rc2-mm1, I keep seeing 'scripts/fixdep: Text
      file busy' messages when doing a -j10 bzImage build - which seems to
      suggest that by the time fixdep is used by the build system it's not
      built yet.
    
    Sam said:
    
    I was pretty sure it was something I had caused, so I gave it a spin.  What
    actually happened was that we tried to build the target 'silentoldconfig'
    in parrallel with 'scripts'.  Since 'silentoldconfig' started a new make
    and then the config target needed 'scripts' we saw two parallel runs.
    
    The way I decided to fix it was to split scripts/ in two parts.  The first
    part is now the very basic stuff - moved to scripts/basic/.  The second
    part is dependent on kernel config etc.  and kept in scripts/
    
    In the 2.7 timeframe i will redo this initial stuff - it's becoming too
    messy for anyone to understand today.
    
    
    Description:
    
    Fix dependencies in early phases of kernel build.  This solves a few
    problems nively: modpost is no longer rebuild twicewhen reaching the
    'target' state 'make -j10' now works nicely again
    
    The patch is rather large due to the following file moves:
    mkdir scripts/basic
    mv scripts/fixdep.c        scripts/basic
    mv scripts/split-include.c scripts/basic
    mv scripts/docproc.c       scripts/basic

    [PATCH] g5: Fix iommu vs. pci_device_to_OF_node
    
    The g5 iommu code would fill the "iommu_table" member of whatever
    device node was pointed to by pcidev->sysdata during boot. However,
    the ppc64 kernel fills that with a pointer to the PHB node which is
    later replaced "lazily" with a pointer to the real node when calling
    pci_device_to_OF_node(). In this case, we were thus "losign" the
    iommu_table pointer. Typical symptom: loss of the SATA when looking
    at it's /proc entry.
    
    This fixes it by forcing the update to the final sysdata pointer
    when filling up the iommu_table pointers. The "lazy" thing is useless
    on pmac anyway.

    [PATCH] ia64: Decode salinfo oemdata for SN2 via PROM
    
    SN2 platforms provide oemdata in salinfo records.  The decode of that
    oemdata is done via prom routines.  This patch provides the interface
    from user space through the kernel into the prom to do the oem decode.

    ia64: Based on patch by Keith Owens: put stop bit to work around GCC problem.
    
    Apparently GCC sometimes fails to insert a stop-bit when re-using p14
    after the spinlock directives, even though the register is clearly marked
    as "clobbered".

    [PATCH] sys_swapon bad arg causing slab corruption
    
    There's an error in sys_swapon() that can cause slab corruption if you
    pass in a bad specialfile pointer. getname() then returns
    ERR_PTR(-EFAULT), but sys_swapon() doesn't clear name before calling
    putname() on it (thus freeing 0xfffffff2, corrupting slab). An ltp test
    case repeatedly crashed in later tests due to thus, irk.

    [PATCH] Set module owner in megaraid driver
    
    This bug was discussed on linux-scsi a few weeks back, but it appears to
    have slipped through the cracks. This fix was originally proposed by
    Christoph Hellwig, but I am reposting it, since I have the hardware :-)
    
    Anyway, the problem that this fixes is that megaraid doesn't set the
    moduler owner for the host_template, this means that the module can be
    removed, even when it is in use.

    code is based on the existing implementations for sparc64, ia64, mips, s390,
    ppc and x86_64, which can subsequently be converted to use this.

    [libata] disable clustering by default, whitespace cleanups
    
    Disable SCSI's clustering of S/G entries, typically reducing overall
    S/G list size.  Although ATA S/G tables are getting smarter (64-bit
    address, 32-bit length, no DMA boundary besides 4G itself), working
    harder to generate large byte sizes for each S/G size is not necessarily
    in our best interest:
    
    * SATA consists of frames, much like ethernet, called "FIS".  A
      Data FIS consists of up to 2048 dwords (8K) of data.  We don't want
      generate large byte sizes in S/G entries, just to have the host controller
      break them up again into smaller chunks.
    * Reduces the possibility that ata_fill_sg (libata-core.c) must split
      an S/G into two pieces, because it straddles a 64K boundary.
    * Reduces the possibility that FIS-related errata workarounds
      must be enabled.  One such exists in the Silicon Image driver (sata_sil),
      which is currently worked around by limiting the max-sectors-per-request
      to 15.

    [PATCH] I2C: New chip driver: ds1621
    
    The following patch against kernel 2.6.4-mm1 adds the ds1621 driver (an
    I2C sensor). I have ported it from the 2.4 version.
    
    It has been reviewed by Jean Delvare, partly on IRC, and it is
    "compliant" with Mark Hoffman's refactoring.

    [PATCH] I2C: Setting w83781d fan_div preserves fan_min
    
    This patch makes the w83781d driver preserve fan_min settings when the
    user changes fan_divs. This isn't done "by default" because the actual
    fan min value (in RPMs) depends on both the fan_min register and the
    fan_div register. Only two drivers handle it properly at the moment as
    far as I know (lm78 and asb100). Several other drivers would need to be
    fixed the same way, but well, once at a time ;)
    
    Tested on my AS99127F rev.1.
    
    Credits go to Philip Pokorny, since I think I remember he is the one who
    introduced the method in the lm78 driver in the first place.
    
    This tends to increase the size of the three set_store_regs_fan_div
    functions, and I am considering refactoring them at some point. Later
    though.

    [PATCH] I2C: Don't handle kind errors that cannot happen
    
    A number of chip drivers in 2.6.4-mm1 try to handle an error case that
    cannot happen when setting the chip name. The following patch changes
    that.
    
    Affected drivers: adm1021, it87, lm75, lm78, lm85, w83627hf, w83781d.
    
    Note that in any case, the worst that could happen (but then again, it
    cannot happen) is that the chip name would be set to an empty string,
    which doesn't hurt much.
    
    The patch also cleans up a few things in it87, w83627hf and w83781d,
    which are tightly related to the rest of the changes and necessary for
    them to be safe.
    
    it87: There is only really one "kind" in this driver, so I removed all
    references to other kinds.
    
    w83627hf: The driver did not handle unknown chips.
    
    w83781d: The user shouldn't be allowed to force a kind that doesn't
    match the chip's bus type (I2C or ISA). The code was not meant to handle
    that case, although no check was done so far.
    
    Tested on my AS99127F, works as intended.

    [PATCH] I2C: fix forced i2c chip drivers have no name
    
    I just noticed that I am doing something wrong in the i2c chip drivers I
    ported to Linux 2.6. If these drivers are forced to a specific chip type
    ("kind" as we call it internally), then the device doesn't have its name
    set (and defaults to an empty string).
    
    Affected drivers: gl518sm, lm83, lm90, w83l785ts.
    
    I could verify the problem on my ADM1032 chip (lm90 driver). I also
    verified that the proposed patch fixes the issue.
    
    You may notice that I fix the problem differently for gl518sm and
    w83l785ts on the one hand, and lm83 and lm90 on the other hand. This is
    because the first two drivers are not expected to support more a single
    chip in the future, while lm90 already does and lm83 could someday (for
    example, support for the LM82 could be added on request).

    Set ide_task_t fields (command_type, handler and prehandler) directly.
    Remove unused ide_task_t->posthandler and all ide_cmd_type_parser() logic.
    
    ide_cmd_type_parser() was meant to be used for ioctls but
    ended up checking validity of kernel generated requests (doh!).
    
    Rationale for removal:
    - it can't be used for existing ioctls (changes the way they work)
    - kernel shouldn't check validity of (root only) user-space requests
      (it can and should be done in user-space)
    - it wastes CPU cycles on going through parsers
    - it makes code harder to understand/follow
      (now info about request is localized)

    struct pcmcia_socket.

    Patch from Dominik Brodowski, updated by Russell King.
    
    pcmcia_bind_mtd was only used by ds.c, and it is only used for 16-bit
    PCMCIA devices. So, move it to ds.c.

    [PCMCIA] Rename driver services constants.
    
    Driver services constants clash with similar constants defined
    by Card services.  Prefix them all with DS_.
    
    This patch started out as Dominik Brodowski's 2.6.0-test9
    ds_includes_cs_internal patch, which only changed one constant
    and attempted to fix PCMCIA debugging.

    [PCMCIA] Clean up socket state handling around shutdown
    
    There is no need for shutdown_socket() to touch s->state
    directly - this can be all done in skt_shutdown().

    [PCMCIA] Add, fix, update PCMCIA debugging.
    
    The PCMCIA core debugging assumes that "pc_debug" is a global.  If
    pc_debug were to be a global, it would pollute the kernel's global
    name space, potentially clashing with PCMCIA drivers and even ds.c.
    
    We also get rid of PCMCIA using the "DEBUG" macro, which is the
    standard macro to enable debugging in the kernel.  Instead, we
    introduce cs_dbg() for core PCMCIA debugging, ds_dbg() for driver
    services debugging, and similar macros in the socket drivers.

    [libata sata_sil] remove incorrect limit on drive quirk
    
    The original submittor of the quirk code noted that the errata
    of a lockup creating when the condition "sector % 15 == 1" is
    true only on chip revisions <= 1.  This is limitation on chip
    revision is apparently not correct, therefore we apply to all
    affected drives in the quirk list.
    
    This is a sledgehammer fix, limiting max-sectors to 15.  A much better
    fix would split the hardware request into two taskfiles, issuing
    an additional command, thereby avoiding "sectors % 15 == 1"
    
    Given the errata is limited to "sil 311x + <these drives>", it is hoped
    that some janitor cares enough to do a real fix.

    [SPARC32]: Rework the CPU enumeration and probing code
    
    The low 2 bits of the MID are now used exclusively as the software
    CPU ID on 4m.  This eliminates entirely the need for mid_xlate.  We
    also eliminate linux_num_cpus and linux_cpus; since the hardware-based
    id is now used everywhere we don't need indexed CPU tables.
    
    The device probe is almost identical to sparc64's version.  The one
    exception is that 4m only uses the bottom 2 bits of the MID, so we also
    have a separate function to get the true hardware MID for the rare times
    it's actually needed.
    
    Per-cpu data is now used the same way as in sparc64.  As a side benefit
    we now display the same format Bogo and Clock values in /proc/cpuinfo.

    [PATCH] move consistent_dma_mask to the generic device
    
    From: James Bottomley <James.Bottomley@SteelEye.com>
    
    pci_dev.consistent_dma_mask was introduced to get around problems in the
    IA64 Altix machine.
    
    Now, we have a use for it in x86: the aacraid needs coherent memory in a
    31 bit address range (2GB).  Unfortunately, x86 is converted to the dma
    model, so it can't see the pci_dev by the time coherent memory is
    allocated.
    
    The solution to all of this is to move pci_dev.consistent_dma_mask to
    dev.coherent_dma_mask and make x86 use it in the dma_alloc_coherent()
    calls.
    
    This should allow me to make the aacraid set the coherent mask instead
    of using it's current dma_mask juggling.

    [PATCH] DMA: Fill gaping hole in DMA API interfaces.
    
    From: "David S. Miller" <davem@redhat.com>
    
    Currently, for an existing DMA mapping, there is a way to transfer buffer
    ownership back to the cpu, yet there is no way to give it back to the device
    again explicitly.  The latter really is needed on platforms where the PCI
    subsystem does not snoop the cpu caches, MIPS is one example.
    
    Many drivers were expecting the existing DMA sync interface to handle both
    directions, which was wrong.
    
    Now, with this change, we have explicit interfaces for DMA syncing to/from
    the device and the cpu.

    Remove unnecessary initialization in notifier_block

    WATCHDOG] v2.6.4 wdt977-v0.03-patch
    
    Version 0.03 of wdt977.c - Changes that were made are:
    * Extract the stop code in a seperate function (wdt977_stop)
    * Extract the start code in a seperate function (wdt977_start)
    * Rename kick_wdog to wdt977_keepalive for consistency
    * Extract the watchdog's status code to a seperate function (wdt977_get_status)
    * Change the way we deal with the watchdog timeout:
       Up till now we used timeoutM (in minutes) as the correct value and then
       calculated timeout as being timeoutM*60 or *timeoutM*120 (depending on
       wether or not we have the netwinder hardware bug).
    
       From now on timeout is the correct value and we calculate timeoutM out
       of it. Because of this we start with checking wether or not we have a
       correct timeout value (if not we reset it to the default value) and we
       automatically calculate timeoutM. Each time we change timeout with a
       correct timeout value, we recalculate timeoutM.
    * Extended ioctl code with WDIOC_SETOPTIONS and updated the watchdog_info structure
    * Added notifier support
    
    Code has been tested by Woody

    [WATCHDOG] v2.6.4 pcwd_pci-v1.00_20040313-patch
    
    Two small fixes:
    * Make cards_found a global variable so that if we remove the
      pci device we can count down.
    * If we can't find a correct I/O address for the card, then we
    should disable the card again.

    From: <martin@meltin.net>
    
    Forward-port from 2.4:
    
    The following patch pulls an NFS server IP address off root_server_path
    (handed out via the DHCP root-path option), if it is present.  For example,
    you can do this sort of thing in dhcpd.conf:
    
      root-path = 192.168.1.33:/tftpboot/yip.zImage
    
    This lets you mount your root filesystem off a different machine than you
    booted from, without needing to use kernel command-line parameters.
    
    The patch appears to be backwards compatible.
    
    RFC2132 says this about the root-path option:
    
       This option specifies the path-name that contains the client's root
       disk.  The path is formatted as a character string consisting of
       characters from the NVT ASCII character set.
    
    This is sufficiently vague to allow the path-name to include an IP-address.
    Also, I found some documentation for FreeBSD saying it does this too, so it
    must be right, because those FreeBSD guys are really smart...  :-)
    
    The only downside of the patch is that the summary that ipconfig prints can
    be a little odd when the kernel command line overrides whatever ipconfig gets
    from (say) DHCP.  The address from the kernel command line seems to get
    stripped off early, so ipconfig reports it, but it doesn't report the kernel
    command line NFS path, since that's handled a bit later...  This small
    cosmetic problem looks difficult to "fix" without rewriting quite a bit of
    stuff...

    [PATCH] Work around an AMD768MPX erratum
    
    From: Andi Kleen <ak@suse.de>
    
    This patch has been in the SuSE 2.4 kernel forever, but for some reason
    never made it mainline.
    
    It works around the infamous "only works stable when a mouse is plugged in"
    problem some AMD 768MPX Dual Athlon chipsets have.  The problem happens
    because the chipset can hang when PCI prefetch strides from a RAM page into
    the VGA text buffer.  When a PS2 mouse is plugged in the BIOS reserves a
    page before the VGA text buffer, which stops the prefetch early.
    
    This patch always reserves this page when the chipset could be AMD768MPX.
    This can be only done early in bootmem setup.  Because it's difficult to
    scan the PCI bus that early it just always reserves this page when the CPU
    is an Athlon.  Normally it should not make a difference because the BIOS
    will have reserved that page anyways when a PS/2 mouse is plugged in.

    [PATCH] use wait_task_inactive() in kthread_bind()
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    Make it clear that the reason we do wait_task_inactive is because
    kthread_bind frobs with k->thread_info->cpu, which is only legal because
    the task is definitely not running.
    
    We can't use the normal migration thread code here, because it doesn't let
    us bind to cpus which are offline yet, and also because we use this to
    start the migration threads themselves.

    [PATCH] further __KERNEL_SYSCALLS__ removal
    
    From: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>
    
    Dave Jones already removed some of the useless __KERNEL_SYSCALLS__ defines
    in various files, this gets rid of almost all the others.  Replacing
    execve() is nontrivial, so I left those in for now.
    
    For all the other system calls that are currently used from inside the
    kernel, calling the sys_* function directly should always have an identical
    effect.

    [PATCH] Manfred's patch to distribute boot allocations across nodes
    
    From: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>
    
    Distribute boot time memory allocations across all nodes, from Manfred
    Spraul.
    
    We want to spread memory across nodes to avoid all allocations ending
    up on node 0.
    
    Spreading boot time allocations around also helps us to avoid node 0
    becoming the hot node.
    
    I took it for a spin:

    [PATCH] Fix removable USB drive oops
    
    The actual problem reported was because there wasn't a corresponding
    check on transport_classdev.class in the unregister.
    
    However, on closer inspection I also turned up a nasty thinko in the
    reference counting.  For reasons best known to the class code authors,
    class devices have to obtain their own references to the devices they're
    attached to which they release again in their .release routines, so you
    have to remember to do a get_device() in the correct place after the
    class_device_add().  I put comments in the code so that, hopefully, we
    can avoid the problem in future.

    [PATCH] Add Domain Validation to the SPI transport class
    
    Domain Validation is a fairly essential element to the SCSI Parallel
    Interface (although if you look very few drivers actually do it).  The
    premise is that the Parallel Bus, being a transmission line, might not
    be correctly tuned to the transfers you want do perform.  DV probes the
    parameters of the transport until it finds a setting that works (for the
    interested, see http://www.t10.org/ftp/t10/drafts/sdv/sdv-r08b.pdf)
    
    The current code employs rather simplistic DV heuristics, although those
    can be improved over time.  The change in scsi_scan.c is so that DV may
    be done easily from the slave_configure routine, which is the most
    natural place to begin.

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20040311 from Bob Moore
    
    Fixed a problem where errors occurring during the parse phase of control
    method execution did not abort cleanly.  For example, objects created
    and installed in the namespace were not deleted.  This caused all
    subsequent invocations of the method to return the AE_ALREADY_EXISTS
    exception.
    
    Implemented a mechanism to force a control method to "Serialized"
    execution if the method attempts to create namespace objects.
    (The root of the AE_ALREADY_EXISTS problem.)
    
    Implemented support for the predefined _OSI "internal" control method.
    Initial supported strings are "Linux", "Windows 2000", "Windows 2001",
    and "Windows 2001.1", and can be easily upgraded for new strings as
    necessary.  This feature allows Linux to execute
    the fully tested, "Windows" code path through the ASL code
    
    Global Lock Support:  Now allows multiple acquires and releases with any
    internal thread.  Removed concept of "owning thread" for this special
    mutex.
    
    Fixed two functions that were inappropriately declaring large objects on
    the CPU stack: ps_parse_loop() and ns_evaluate_relative().
    Reduces the stack usage during method execution considerably.
    
    Fixed a problem in the ACPI 2.0 FACS descriptor (actbl2.h) where the
    S4Bios_f field was incorrectly defined as UINT32 instead of UINT32_BIT.
    
    Fixed a problem where acpi_ev_gpe_detect() would fault
    if there were no GPEs defined on the machine.
    
    Implemented two runtime options:  One to force all control method
    execution to "Serialized" to mimic Windows behavior, another to disable
    _OSI support if it causes problems on a given machine.

    [PATCH] update the 53c700 use of transport attributes
    
    This patch just brings it up to date with the previous transport
    attribute patch, moving it to the model where it sets the min/max of the
    attribute if asked for something outside its range.  It also only makes
    period and offset visible (it doesn't care about any of the others).

    - Make the period adjust to the closest value rather than ignoring
    values it doesn't understand.
    - Add a visibility field to attributes, so drivers can get rid of
    attributes they're never going to care about

    [PATCH] add device quiescing to the SCSI API
    
    This patch adds the ability to quiesce a SCSI device.  The idea is that
    user issued commands (including filesystem ones) would get blocked,
    while mid-layer and device issued ones would be allowed to proceed.
    This is for things like Domain Validation which like to operate on an
    otherwise quiet device.
    
    There is one big change: to get all of this to happen correctly,
    scsi_do_req() has to queue on the *head* of the request queue, not the
    tail as it was doing previously.  The reason is that deferred requests
    block the queue, so anything needing executing after a deferred request
    has to go in front of it.  I don't think there are any untoward
    consequences of this.

    [PATCH] cdev 2/2: hide cdev->kobj
    
    The existing cdev interface requires users to deal with the embedded
    kobject in two places:
    
    - The kobject name field must be set before adding the cdev, and
    - Should cdev_add() fail, a call to kobject_put() is required.
    
    IMO, this exposure of the embedded kobject makes the interface more brittle
    and harder to understand.  It's also unnecessary.  With the removal of
    /sys/cdev, a call to cdev_del() will nicely replace kobject_put(), and the
    name setting is easily wrapped.
    
    This is against 2.6.4, but depends on the /sys/cdev removal patch.

    [PATCH] cdev 1/2: Eliminate /sys/cdev
    
    This is the first of two patches designed to make life easier for authors
    of device driver books - and, with luck, driver authors too.
    
    /sys/cdev is, according to Al, a mistake which was never really meant to
    exist.  I believe nothing uses it currently - there isn't a whole lot there
    to use.  Its existence takes up system resources, and also requires drivers
    to deal with the cdev's embedded kobject in their failure paths.  The
    following patch (against 2.6.4) makes it all go away.
    
    OK, almost all.  We have to keep (but not register) cdev_subsys because
    it's rwsem is needed to control access to cdev_map.

    [PATCH] ia64: clean up ACPI GSI/IRQ conversions (ia64 part)
    
    Add "acpi_gsi_to_irq()" as a generic replacement for "acpi_irq_to_vector()".
    This converts from an ACPI global system interrupt number to a Linux IRQ.
    Also, convert ia64-specific terminology to use GSI when appropriate.

    [PATCH] slab: avoid higher-order allocations
    
    From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
    
    At present slab is using 2-order allocations for the size-2048 cache.  Of
    course, this can affect networking quite seriously.
    
    The patch ensures that slab will never use more than a 1-order allocation
    for objects which have a size of less than 2*PAGE_SIZE.

    [PATCH] vm: balance inactive zone refill rates
    
    The current refill logic in refill_inactive_zone() takes an arbitrarily large
    number of pages and chops it down to SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX*4, regardless of the
    size of the zone.
    
    This has the effect of reducing the amount of refilling of large zones
    proportionately much more than of small zones.
    
    We made this change in may 2003 and I'm damned if I remember why.  let's put
    it back so we don't truncate the refill count and see what happens.

    [PATCH] vmscan: batch up inactive list scanning work
    
    From: Nick Piggin <piggin@cyberone.com.au>
    
    Use a "refill_counter" for inactive list scanning, similar to the one used
    for active list scanning.  This batches up scanning now that we precisely
    balance ratios, and don't round up the amount to be done.
    
    No observed benefits, but I imagine it would lower the acquisition
    frequency of the lru locks in some cases, and make codepaths more efficient
    in general due to cache niceness.

    [PATCH] vmscan: less throttling of page allocators and kswapd
    
    This is just a random unsubstantiated tuning tweak: don't immediately
    throttle page allocators and kwapd when the going is getting heavier: scan a
    bit more of the LRU before throttling.

    [PATCH] fix the kswapd zone scanning algorithm
    
    This removes a vestige of the old algorithm.  We don't want to skip zones if
    all_zones_ok is true: we've already precalculated which zones need scanning
    and this just stops us from ever performing kswapd reclaim from the DMA zone.

    [PATCH] kswapd: fix lumpy page reclaim
    
    As kswapd is now scanning zones in the highmem->normal->dma direction it can
    get into competition with the page allocator: kswapd keep on trying to free
    pages from highmem, then kswapd moves onto lowmem.  By the time kswapd has
    done proportional scanning in lowmem, someone has come in and allocated a few
    pages from highmem.  So kswapd goes back and frees some highmem, then some
    lowmem again.  But nobody has allocated any lowmem yet.  So we keep on and on
    scanning lowmem in response to highmem page allocations.
    
    With a simple `dd' on a 1G box we get:

    [PATCH] kswapd: avoid unnecessary reclaiming from higher zones
    
    Currently kswapd walks across all zones in dma->normal->highmem order,
    performing proportional scanning until all zones are OK.  This means that
    pressure against ZONE_NORMAL causes unnecessary reclaim of ZONE_HIGHMEM.
    
    To fix that up we change kswapd so that it walks the zones in the
    high->normal->dma direction, skipping zones which are OK.  Once it encounters
    a zone which needs some reclaim kswapd will perform proportional scanning
    against that zone as well as all the succeeding lower zones.
    
    We scan the lower zones even if they have sufficient free pages.  This is
    because
    
    a) the lower zone may be above pages_high, but because of the incremental
       min, the lower zone may still not be eligible for allocations.  That's bad
       because cache in that lower zone will then not be scanned at the correct
       rate.
    
    b) pages in this lower zone are usable for allocations against the higher
       zone.  So we do want to san all the relevant zones at an equal rate.

    [PATCH] vmscan: avoid bogus throttling
    
    - If max_scan evaluates to zero due to a very small inactive list and high
      `priority' numbers, we don't want to thrlttle yet.
    
    - In balance_pgdat(), we may end up not scanning any pages because all
      zones happened to be above pages_high.  Avoid throttling in this case too.

    [PATCH] Balance inter-zone scan rates
    
    When page reclaim is working out how many pages to san in a zone (max-scan)
    it presently rounds that number up if it looks too small - for work batching.
    
    Problem is, this can result in excessive scanning against small zones which
    have few inactive pages.  So remove it.
    
    Not that it is possible for max_scan to be zero.  That's OK - it'll become
    non-zero as the priority increases.

    [PATCH] vmscan: drive everything via nr_to_scan
    
    Page reclaim is currently a bit schitzo: sometimes we say "go and scan this
    many pages and tell me how many pages were freed" and at other times we say
    "go and scan this many pages, but stop if you freed this many".
    
    It makes the logic harder to control and to understand.  This patch coverts
    everything into the "go and scan this many pages and tell me how many pages
    were freed" model.
    
    It doesn't seem to affect performance much either way.

    [PATCH] vmscan: zone balancing fix
    
    We currently have a problem with the balancing of reclaim between zones: much
    more reclaim happens against highmem than against lowmem.
    
    This patch partially fixes this by changing the direct reclaim path so it
    does not bale out of the zone walk after having reclaimed sufficient pages
    from highmem: go on to reclaim from lowmem regardless of how many pages we
    reclaimed from lowmem.

    [PATCH] vm: scan slab in response to highmem scanning
    
    The patch which went in six months or so back which said "only reclaim slab
    if we're scanning lowmem pagecache" was wrong.  I must have been asleep at
    the time.
    
    We do need to scan slab in response to highmem page reclaim as well.  Because
    all the math is based around the total amount of memory in the machine, and
    we know that if we're performing highmem page reclaim then the lower zones
    have no free memory.

    [PATCH] kswapd throttling fixes
    
    The logic in balance_pgdat() is all bollixed up.
    
    - the incoming arg `nr_pages' should be used to determine if we're being
      asked to free a specific number of pages, not `to_free'.
    
    - local variable `to_free' is not appropriate for the determination of
      whether we failed to bring all zones to appropriate free pages levels.
    
      Fix this by correctly calculating `all_zones_ok' and then use
      all_zones_ok to determine whether we need to throttle kswapd.
    
    So the logic now is:
    
    
    	for (increasing priority) {
    
    		all_zones_ok = 1;
    
    		for (all zones) {
    			to_reclaim = number of pages to try to reclaim
    				     from this zone;
    			max_scan = number of pages to scan in this pass
    				   (gets larger as `priority' decreases)
    			/*
    			 * set `reclaimed' to the number of pages which were
    			 * actually freed up
    			 */
    			reclaimed = scan(max_scan pages);
    			reclaimed += shrink_slab();
    
    			to_free -= reclaimed;	/* for the `nr_pages>0' case */
    
    			/*
    			 * If this scan failed to reclaim `to_reclaim' or more
    			 * pages, we're getting into trouble.  Need to scan
    			 * some more, and throttle kswapd.   Note that this
    			 * zone may now have sufficient free pages due to
    			 * freeing activity by some other process.   That's
    			 * OK - we'll pick that info up on the next pass
    			 * through the loop.
    			 */
    			if (reclaimed < to_reclaim)
    				all_zones_ok = 0;
    		}
    		if (to_free > 0)
    			continue;	/* swsusp: need to do more work */
    		if (all_zones_ok)
    			break;		/* kswapd is done */
    		/*
    		 * OK, kswapd is getting into trouble.  Take a nap, then take
    		 * another pass across the zones.
    		 */
    		blk_congestion_wait();
    	}

    Various fixes and enhancements to the monitor hardware detection code.  The
    only driver that uses it is the radeon driver.
    
    Old EDID parsing code was very verbose, half of the patch address this (ie.
    print lots of stuff iff DEBUG).  The other big change is the FB_MODE_IS_*
    stuff: we really need a way to know the origin of a video mode.  In this way
    we can select video mode that comes from EDID instead of VESA or GTF.
    
    Drivers other than radeonfb won't be affected because they cannot (yet) get
    EDID from the monitor and don't use EDID related code.

    Readahead of raid0 was suboptimal; it read only 1 stride ahead.  The

    actually manage to make larger IO's, eg each disk would just do the chunk
    size IO.  Doing at least 2 chunks is more than appropriate so that each
    spindle will get a chance to merge IO's.

    [PATCH] EDD: Get Legacy Parameters
    
    From: Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
    
    Patch below from Patrick J. LoPresti and myself.  Patrick describes:
    
    Why this patch?  The problem is that the legacy BIOS interface
    (INT13/AH=3D08) for querying the disk geometry returns different values
    than the extended INT13 interface which the EDD code currently uses.  This
    is because the legacy interface only provides a 10-bit cylinder field, so
    modern BIOSes "lie" about the head/sector counts in order to make more of
    the disk visible within the first 1024 cylinders.
    
    Many non-Linux applications, including the stock Windows boot loader, DOS
    fdisk, etc., rely upon the legacy interface and geometry.  So it is useful
    to be able to obtain the legacy values from a running Linux kernel.
    
    What this patch does is to add new entries under
    /sys/firmware/edd/int13_devXX named "legacy_cylinders", "legacy_heads", and
    "legacy_sectors".  These provide the geometry given by the legacy
    INT13/AH=3D08 BIOS interface, just like the current "default_cylinders"
    etc.  provide the the geometry given by the INT13/AH=3D48 interface.
    
    Without this patch, I cannot use Linux to partition a drive and install
    Windows, which happens to be my application.
    
     - Pat
       http://unattended.sourceforge.net/
    
    In addition, this adds two buggy BIOS workarounds  in the EDD int13
    calls as suggested by Ralf Brown's interrupt list.
    
    I'm also interested in moving this code out of arch/i386/kernel/edd.c and
    include/asm-i386/edd.h, as I believe it is applicable on x86-64 as well.
    However, there's no good place under drivers/ to put edd.c when it's not
    tied to a bus, but to several CPU architectures and their firmwares...
    Maybe a new directory drivers/firmware?

    [PATCH] Fix reading the last block on a bdev
    
    From: Chris Mason <mason@suse.com>
    
    This patch fixes a problem we're hitting on ia64 with page sizes > 4k.
    
    When the page size is greater than the block size, and parts of the page
    fall past the end of the device, readpage will fail because
    blkdev_get_block returns -EIO for blocks past i_size.
    
    The attached patch changes blkdev_get_block to return holes when reading
    past the end of the device, which allows us to read that last valid 4k
    block and then fill the rest of the page with zeros.  Writes will still
    fail with -EIO.

    It's slower now, but that shouldn't be a problem.
    
    Also make it non static to allow easier checks elsewhere.

    [PATCH] fadvise(POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED) fixups
    
    From: WU Fengguang <wfg@mail.ustc.edu.cn>
    
    - In sys_fadvise64_64(): if the start and/or end offsets do not fall on
      page boundaries, preserve the partial pages.  The thinking here is that it
      is better to preserve needed memory than to not shoot down unneeded memory.
    
    - In invalidate_mapping_pages(): we were invalidating an entire pagevec's
      worth of pages each time around, even if that went beyond the part of the
      file which the caller asked to be invalidated.  Fix that up.

    [PATCH] Remove arbitrary #acl entries limits on ext[23] when reading
    
    From: Andreas Gruenbacher <agruen@suse.de>
    
    Remove the arbitrary limit of 32 ACL entries on ext[23] when reading from
    disk.  This change is backward compatible; we need to have this change in
    to be able to also allow writing big ACLs.
    
    The second patch that removes the ACL entry limit for writes is not
    included.  I don't want to push that patch now, because large ACLs would
    cause 2.4 and current 2.6 kernels to fail.  My plan is to remove the second
    limit later, in a half-year or year or so.

    [PATCH] Remove unneeded unlock in ipc/sem.c
    
    From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
    
    sem_revalidate checks that a semaphore array didn't disappear while the
    code was running without the semaphore array spinlock.  If the array
    disappeared, then it will return without holding a lock.  find_undo calls
    sem_revalidate and then sem_unlock, even if sem_revalidate failed.  The
    sem_unlock call must be removed.
    
    Mingming Cao reported a spinlock deadlock with sysv semaphores.  A
    superflous unlock doesn't explain the deadlock, but it's obviously a bug.

    [PATCH] kbuild: fix usage with directories containing '.o'
    
    From: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>
    
    From: Daniel Mack <daniel@zonque.org>, me
    
    modpost unconditionally searched for ".o" assuming this is always the
    suffix of the module.  This fails in two cases:
    
    a) when building external modules where any directory include ".o" in
       the name.  One example is a directory named: .../cvs.alsa.org/...
    
    b) when someone names a kernel directory so it contains ".o".  One
       example is drivers/scsi/aic.ok/...
    
    case b) was triggered by renaming the directory for aic7xxx, and modifying
    Makefile and Kconfig.  This caused make modules to fail.

    [PATCH] loop setup race fix
    
    From: Chris Mason <mason@suse.com>
    
    There's a race in loopback setup, it's easiest to trigger with one or more
    procs doing loopback mounts at the same time.  The problem is that
    fs/block_dev.c:do_open() only calls bdev_set_size on the first open.
    Picture two procs:
    
    proc1: mount -o loop file1 mnt1
    proc2: mount -o loop file2 mnt2
    
    proc1                   proc2
    open /dev/loop0                         # bd_openers now 1
    do_open
     bd_set_size(bdev, 0)                   # loop unbound, so bdev size is 0
                            open /dev/loop0 # bd_openers now 2
    loop_set_fd                             # disk capacity now correct, but
    				        # bdev not updated
    mount /dev/loop0 /mnt
    do_open
    
    Because bd_openers != 0 for the last do_open, bd_set_size is not called
    again and a size of 0 is used.  This eventually leads to an oops when the
    loop device is unmounted, because fsync_bdev calls block_write_full_page
    who decides every page on the block device is outside i_size and unmaps
    them.
    
    When ext2 or reiserfs try to sync a metadata buffer, we get an oops on
    because the buffers are no longer mapped.
    
    The patch below changes loop_set_fd and loop_clr_fd to also manipulate the
    size of the block device, which fixes things for me.

    [PATCH] LOOP_CHANGE_FD ioctl
    
    From: Arjan van de Ven <arjanv@redhat.com>
    
    The patch below (written by Al Viro) solves a nasty chicken-and-egg issue
    for operating system installers (well at least anaconda but the problem
    domain is not exclusive to that)
    
    The basic problem is this:
    
    - The small first stage installer locates the image file of the second
      stage installer (which has X and all the graphical stuff); this image can
      be on the same CD, but it can come via NFS, http or ftp or ...  as well.
    
    - The first stage installer loop-back mounts this image and gives control
      to the second stage installer by calling some binary there.
    
    - The graphical installer then asks the user all those questions and
      starts installing packages.  Again the packages can come from the CD but
      also from NFS or http or ...
    
    Now in case of a CD install, once all requested packages from the first CD
    are installed, the installer wants to unmount and eject the CD and prompt
    the user to put CD 2 in.......  EXCEPT that the unmount can't work since
    the installer is actually running from a loopback mount of this cd.
    
    The solution is a "LOOP_CHANGE_FD" ioctl, where basically the installer
    copies the image to the harddisk (which can only be done late since only
    late the target harddisk is mkfs'd) and then magically switches the backing
    store FD from underneath the loop device to the one on the target harddisk
    (and thus unbusying the CD mount).
    
    This is obviously only allowed if the size of the new image is identical
    and if the loop image is read-only in the first place.  It's the
    responsibility of root to make sure the contents is the same (but that's of
    the give-root-enough-rope kind)

    From: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>
    
    Make the difference between 'make clean' and 'make distclean/mrproper' more
    explicit.
    
    make clean now removes all generated files except .config* and .version.
    The result is much easier to understand now.
    
    make clean deletes all generated files (except .config* and .version).
    make mrproper deletes configuration and all temporary files left by patch,
    editors and the like.
    
    Example output:
    > make mrproper
      CLEAN   init
      CLEAN   usr
      CLEAN   scripts/kconfig
      CLEAN   scripts
      CLEAN   .tmp_versions include/config
      CLEAN   include/asm-i386/asm_offsets.h include/linux/autoconf.h include/linux/version.h include/asm .tmp_versions
      CLEAN   .version .config
    
    Form the list of files/directories deleted during make clean, removed all
    references that is no longer relevant for the current kernel.

    linux-ia64, where most of NUMA people resides, no objections are raised so
    far.
    
    The patch adds NUMA-specific version of build_zonelists which calls
    find_next_best_node to select the next-nearest node to add to zonelist.
    
    The patch has no effect on flat NUMA platform.

    [PATCH] i386 very early memory detection cleanup patch
    
    From: "H. Peter Anvin" <hpa@zytor.com>
    
    This patch cleans up the very early memory setup on the i386 platform.  In
    particular, it removes the hard-coded 8 MB limit completely by dynamically
    creating the early-boot pagetables rather than having them hard coded.
    
    While I was at it, I changed head.S so that it always sets up a local GDT;
    this means among other things that SMP and VISWS are no longer special
    cases, and is conceptually cleaner to boot.  The VISWS people have
    confirmed it works on VISWS.
    
    It also uses a separate entrypoint for non-boot processors since this is
    completely kernel-internal anyway.  This eliminates the need to set %bx on
    boot.  (If you think this is a bad idea I can eliminate this change; it
    just seemed cleaner to me to do it this way.)
    
    Additionally, zero bss with rep;stosl rather that rep;stosb.

    [PATCH] teach /proc/kmsg about O_NONBLOCK
    
    If there's nothing available and the file is O_NONBLOCK, return -EAGAIN.
    
    This is a bit grubby - really we should push the file* down into do_syslog()
    and handle it inside the spinlock.

    [PATCH] time interpolator fix
    
    From: john stultz <johnstul@us.ibm.com>
    
    In developing the ia64-cyclone patch, which implements a cyclone based time
    interpolator, I found the following bug which could cause time
    inconsistencies.
    
    In update_wall_time_one_tick(), which is called each timer interrupt, we
    call time_interpolator_update(delta_nsec) where delta_nsec is approximately
    NSEC_PER_SEC/HZ.  This directly correlates with the changes to xtime which
    occurs in update_wall_time_one_tick().
    
    However in update_wall_time(), on a second overflow, we again call
    time_interpolator_update(NSEC_PER_SEC).  However while the components of
    xtime are being changed, the overall value of xtime does not (nsec is
    decremented NSEC_PER_SEC and sec is incremented).  Thus this call to
    time_interpolator_update is incorrect.
    
    This patch removes the incorrect call to time_interpolator_update and was
    found to resolve the time inconsistencies I had seen while developing the
    ia64-cyclone patch.

    [PATCH] adaptive lazy readahead
    
    From: Suparna Bhattacharya <suparna@in.ibm.com>
    
    From: Ram Pai <linuxram@us.ibm.com>
    
    Pipelined readahead behaviour is suitable for sequential reads, but not for
    large random reads (typical of database workloads), where lazy readahead
    provides a big performance boost.
    
    One option (suggested by Andrew Morton) would be to have the application
    pass hints to turn off readahead by setting the readahead window to zero
    using posix_fadvise64(POSIX_FADV_RANDOM), and to special-case that in
    do_generic_mapping_read to completely bypass the readahead logic and
    instead read in all the pages needed directly.
    
    This was the idea I started with.  But then I thought, we can do a still
    better job ?  How about adapting the readahead algorithm to lazy-read or
    non-lazy-read based on the past i/o patterns ?
    
    The overall idea is to keep track of average number of contiguous pages
    accessed in a file.  If the average at any given time is above ra->pages
    the pattern is sequential.  If not the pattern is random.  If pattern is
    sequential do non-lazy-readahead( read as soon as the first page in the
    active window is touched) else do lazy-readahead.
    
    I have studied the behaviour of this patch using my user-level simulator.
    It adapts pretty well.
    
    Note from Suparna: This appears to bring streaming AIO read performance for
    large (64KB) random AIO reads back to sane values (since the lazy readahead
    backout in the mainline).

    [PATCH] readdir() cleanups
    
    From: <viro@parcelfarce.linux.theplanet.co.uk>
    
    cramfs and freevxfs explicitly mark themselves readonly (as other r/o fs
    do).
    
    afs marked noatime (ACKed by maintainer)
    
    filesystems that do not do update_atime() in their ->readdir() had been
    explicitly marked nodiratime.  NOTE: cifs, coda and ncpfs almost certainly
    need full noatime as we currently have in nfs and afs.
    
    update_atime() call shifted to callers of ->readdir() and out of
    ->readdir() instances.  Bugs caught:
    
      dcache_readdir() updated atime only if it reached EOF.
    
      bfs_readdir() - ditto.
    
      qnx4_readdir() - ditto.

    [PATCH] ppc64: fix initialisation of NUMA arrays
    
    From: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>
    
    We were hitting problems on machines with cpu_possible != cpu_online when
    NUMA was enabled.  The debug checks would trip during scheduler init
    because we iterate through all possible cpus whereas we only set up NUMA
    information for online cpus.
    
    Longer term we should have a cpu_up hook which sets up its NUMA information
    but for now we initalise all possible cpus and memory to node 0.

    [PATCH] fix ppc64 in kernel syscalls
    
    Thanks to some great debugging work by Olaf Hering and Marcus Meissner
    it has been noticed that the current ppc64 syscall code is corrupting
    4 bytes past errno. Why we even bothered to set errno beats me, its
    unusable in the kernel.
    
    Since we had to reinstate the inline syscall code we can go back to
    using it for those few syscalls that we call. Especially now with
    Randy's syscall prototype cleanup we should be calling them directly
    but we can do that sometime later.

    [PATCH] CDROMREADAUDIO dma support
    
    This small patch builds on top of the blk_rq_map_user() patch just sent,
    and enables us to easily support DMA for CDROMREADAUDIO cdda extraction.
    It's quite amazing how much cool stuff you can with the new block layer
    :-)
    
    Patch has intelligent fall back from multi frame dma to single frame
    dma, and further to old-style pio ripping in case of hardware problems.

    [PATCH] user data -> request mapping
    
    This patch allows you to map a request with user data for io, similarly
    to what you can do with bio_map_user() already to a bio. However, this
    goes one step further and populates the request so the user only has to
    fill in the cdb (almost) and put it on the queue for execution. Patch
    converts sg_io() to use it, next patch I'll send adapts cdrom layer to
    use it for zero copy cdda dma extraction.

    This patch is a refactoring of some common code among all sensors chip

    ok.  I've only tested it against one of the drivers, but the changes are
    similar across the board and quite mechanical.  Please apply.

    [PATCH] USB Gadget: add "gadget_chips.h"
    
    This adds standard gadget_is_*() calls.  Gadget drivers using
    those calls can get rid of some inlined #ifdefs, and will also
    be able to do more "late binding" to their hardware.
    
    
    Define gadget_is_*() calls, to help do late binding to USB controllers.
    
    Current gadget drivers expect to know at compile time what hardware
    they'll bind to.  That's not very friendly to a generic PDA distro,
    which might prefer to defer such choices to run time.
    
    These macros let drivers change that code from inlined #ifdefs (ugh) to
    normal C statements (looks much nicer), so making those "what hardware"
    policy choices at run time gets easier.

    ia64: don't unmask iosapic interrupts by default
    
    In ia64 kernel, IOSAPIC's RTEs for PCI interrupts are unmasked at the
    boot time before installing device drivers. I think it is very dangerous.
    If some PCI devices without device driver generate interrupts, interrupts
    are generated repeatedly because these interrupt requests are never
    cleared. I think RTEs for PCI interrupts should be unmasked by device
    driver.  This patch fixes the problem.

    [PATCH] x86-64 merge for 2.6.4
    
    The biggest new feature is fixed 32bit vsyscall (SYSCALL+SYSENTER)
    support, mostly from Jakub Jelinek.  This increases 32bit syscall
    performance greatly (latency halved and better).  The SYSENTER for Intel
    support required some infrastructure changes, but seems to work now too.
    
    The 64bit vsyscall vtime() just references xtime.tv_sec now.  This
    should make it a lot faster too.
    
    A fix for some Intel IA32e systems.  Also a few long standing bugs in
    NMI like exception handlers were fixed.
    
    And a lot of other bug fixes.
    
    Full changeLog:
     - Clean up 32bit address room limit handling, fix 3gb personality
     - Move memcpy_{from,to}io export to ksyms.c file. This seems to work
       around a toolchain bug (Andreas Gruenbacher)
     - Update defconfig
     - ACPI merges from i386 (SBF should work now, acpi=strict)
     - Implement mmconfig support based on i386 code (untested)
     - Fix i386/x86-64 pci source file sharing
     - Implement ptrace access for 32bit vsyscall page
     - Always initialize all 32bit SYSENTER/SYSCALL MSRs.
     - Export run time cache line size to generic kernel
     - Remove explicit CPUID in ia32 syscall code
     - Fill in most of boot_cpu_data early
     - Remove unused PER_LINUX32 setup

    [PATCH] G5 temperature control update
    
    This makes the temperature control code more robust, putting less
    pressure on i2c, and work around occasional misconfiguration of the ADC

    [PATCH] SCSI: megaraid /proc dir fix
    
    I know that LSI are working on an updated driver for 2.6, but would
    really like to see this bug fix placed in the main tree before then,
    whenever then happens to be.
    
    This patch fixes the problem of the /proc entries for this driver being
    created in the wrong location.

    At present there is no way to retry, if allowed, a scsi command without
    decrementing the scsi command's retry count.
    
    Please find a patch attached, which is submitted, for adding a new host_byte
    status code called "DID_IMM_RETRY". This enables the Low Level SCSI drivers
    to initiate retry of a scsi command without decrementing the scsi commad's
    retry count.

    What happens if that class_simple_create() fails?  Actually,
    class_simple_device_add could fail too, but doesn't seem anybody is
    checking for that.

    Here it is.
    
    The patch is only one line for 2.6.4-rc2. (I also did a little formatting
    adjustment to better comply with CodingStyle)
    
    For the 2.4.26-pre1 kernel, I also backported the return codes correction patch
    from Oliver Neukum.
    
    
    The problem with the write function was that, in non-blocking mode, after
    submitting the first urb, the function would return with -EAGAIN, not reporting
    to the application that in fact it had already sent "transfer_length" bytes.
    This way the application would have to send the data *again* causing lots of
    errors.
    
    It did return the correct amount with my first patch, because the writecount was
    being updated on the end of the loop. However this was wrong for blocking I/O.
    
    The "transfer_length" local variable is still needed because if we used the
    transfer_buffer_length field from the urb, then on a second call to write, if
    the urb was still pending (in non-blocking mode), the write would return an
    incorrect amount of data written.
    
    Anyway, this time I tested it using blocking and non-blocking I/O and it works
    for both cases. Even better, this patch only changes the behaviour for
    non-blocking I/O, and keeps the same behaviour for the more usual blocking I/O
    (at least on kernel 2.6).

    [PATCH] I2C: Cleanup fan_div in w83781d
    
    Here is a proposed patch that cleanups the fan_div code from w83781d.
    The original code was obviously taken from the 2.4 driver, but the way
    things were done in 2.4 do not make any sense anymore (because we now
    have a single value per interface file).
    
    Since fan divisor bits are spread over three different regs with various
    bitmask manipulations, I don't think it makes much sense to have a
    single function as we do in most other cases. Having three different
    functions makes more sense, although they are of course similar. The
    size increment is only 581 bytes, I don't think its a problem since it
    also makes the code much more efficient and readable too IMHO.
    
    I agree that the original code was working - it was simply doing far too
    much work each time one would want to change a fan divisor.
    
    Originally, I took a look at the code because I wanted to fix the fact
    that changing fan divisors breaks fan mins. But it looked like a good
    cleanup before doing that was required. Once this patch will have been
    accepted, I'll work on the other one.
    
    I've tested my patch successfully on a W83781D and an AS99127F rev.1.
    Note that this means that one part of the code wasn't tested, because
    these are the two chips of the family that do not support divisors
    greater than 8. If anyone can test it, please do.

    [PATCH] PCI Hotplug: Fix PCIE and SHPC hotplug drivers for ia64
    
    This patch fixes the PCIE and SHPC hotplug driver for ia64.  The function
    pcibios_set_irq_routing only exists on x86, and acpi_bridges_head may be
    NULL, so don't crash.

    [PATCH] USB: Altsetting/interface update for USB image drivers
    
    This patch contains minute updates for the hpusbscsi, mdc800, and microtek
    drivers.  Only two things are worth noting.  In the mdc800 driver I
    removed some unnecessary calls to usb_driver_claim_interface(),
    usb_driver_release_interface(), and usb_set_interface().  Likewise, in the
    microtek driver I removed an unnecessary call to usb_set_interface().

    Make the SCSI mempool allocations variable
    
    We still retain the default MAX_PHYS_SEGMENTS (which
    is currently 128).  However, a mechanism for raising
    the limit correctly is added for people who wish to
    benchmark with larger sglists.
    
    A decision on how we present this to the user will be
    taken at a later time when more information about
    the usefulness of a higher limit is available

    [PATCH] USB gadget: gadget zero, simplified controller-specific configuration
    
    This removes several controller-specific #define, and
    converts to using the config_buf utilities.  Depends
    on the patch I submitted yesterday.  Looking simpler!
    
    
    Simplify "gadget zero" compile-time configuration.
    
    This removes several controller-specific compile-time config options;
    the others are about to be autoconfigured.
    
     - HIGHSPEED replaced by CONFIG_USB_GADGET_DUALSPEED
     - Default to self-powered operation
     - There's no UI for remote wakeup
    
    It also uses the new config_buf utilities, so it's a bit easier to see
    what's really going on (this driver implements four configurations).

    This includes some small updates to "usbtest", mostly

    usbtest updates, supporting new firmware
    
        - Support the new usbtest_fw-20040305 EZ-USB firmware,
          which renumerates and handles full speed ISO transfers.
          (From Martin Diehl.)
    
        - Minor cleanups:  use dev_dbg(), let some slightly-off
          devices work in the control queueing test.
    
        - Be pickier about unlink tests:  insist that async
          and sync unlinks give the appropriate fault code.

    [PATCH] USB: usb_unlink_urb() has distinct "not linked" fault
    
    This gets rid of an often-bogus diagnostic, and lets
    at least the unlink test code recover reasonably when
    it hits that brief window while another CPU has gotten
    the complete() callback but hasn't yet resubmitted.
    
    
    
    Return distinct code when unlinking an urb that's not linked.
    
    This lets drivers handle this fault sanely, when they need to.
    Gets rid of annoying non-error messages about drivers that unlink
    in disconnect() even when the urb isn't linked.

    [PATCH] USB gadget: dualspeed {run,compile}-time flags
    
    This is the first several autoconfig patches; please merge.
    This particular one abstracts dual-speed (high and full)
    support.
    
    
    Support some more autoconfiguration for gadget drivers.
    
        Run-time:
    	* Add gadget->is_dualspeed flag for controllers to set.
    	* Tested by "ethernet" gadget, to decide whether certain
    	  operations are errors or not.
    	* Turned on by net2280.
    
        Compile-time
    	* Generic CONFIG_USB_GADGET_DUALSPEED, not net2280-specific.
    	* Used by "ethernet" gadget, to decide whether to
    	  include extra code and data for dual-speed support.
    	* Turned on by net2280.
    
    The basic idea behind this, and other autoconfig patches yet to come,
    is minimizing the controller-specific compile-time configuration
    needed by gadget drivers.

    [PATCH] USB: Remove interface/altsetting assumptions from usb-midi
    
    This patch makes the usb-midi driver use usb_ifnum_to_if(), thereby
    removing assumptions about which interface is stored in which array entry.
    Similarly, it stores the bAlternateSetting value rather than the array
    index for an altsetting entry.
    
    Like the earlier patch for the audio driver, this also changes the driver
    to use the in-memory rawdescriptor buffer rather than reading a
    configuration descriptor from the device.  Unlike that earlier patch, this
    time there's no question that the deallocation of the buffer is done
    correctly.  (I suspect the audio driver just left out a call to kfree.)

    No it isn't.  But maybe the attached patch would clarify what's

    is the peripheral side.

    [PATCH] I2C: fix i2c adapters class for now
    
    Please accept this temporary fix for the class issue. I'd like users of

    sensors as soon as possible, even if we have not yet determined what our
    policy WRT classes should be.
    
    Thanks.
    
    BTW, don't you think I2C_ADAP_CLASS_SMBUS is a misnomer? It's about
    hardware monitoring, not the SMBus protocol. I'd say
    I2C_ADAP_CLASS_HWMON or I2C_ADAP_CLASS_SENSORS would have been more
    appropriate (although it may be a bit late for a change...)

    [libata] Split up shared IO register locations into individual components
    
    Most ATA host controllers follow a standard layout for the
    ATA shadow registers, where command/status, error/feature, and
    devctl/altstatus share a single bus I/O address, because one register
    of each pair is read-only, and the other is write-only.
    
    On the Vitesse/Intel chip, all registers are given distinction bus I/O
    addresses, which necessitates changing the libata data structures
    to cope with this.  This simply involves storing a few more bus addresses.

    making our own one up.

    [PATCH] USB brlvger: Driver obsoleted by rewrite using usbfs
    
    We have rewritten the brlvger (Tieman Voyager USB Braille display) driver
    so that it works from user-space through usbfs. It appears to work just as
    well as the in-kernel driver.
    
    The brlvger driver in the 2.6.x kernel is now obsolete and should be
    removed. The attached patch against 2.6.3 does this. Please apply.
    NB: The following files are completely deleted:
        Documentation/usb/brlvger.txt
        drivers/usb/misc/brlvger.c
        include/linux/brlvger.h
    
    The new Voyager driver is available (stil under GPL) as part of BRLTTY,
    starting with version 3.5pre1 (http://mielke.cc/brltty).
    Thanks to Dave Mielke who implemented BRLTTY's usbfs functionality, among
    lots of other stuff.

    You're right, it is a mess.  Beats me why they didn't use a plain old
    "for" statement to do that altsetting loop.  Probably the most confusing
    part is where the code needlessly resets intf->act_altsetting.
    
    Anyway, this patch sets things right.  I haven't tried to compile it, but
    any errors ought to be pretty small, obvious, and easy to fix.
    
    My intention was to go through the files under driver/usb (in alphabetical
    order!) and then do the ones outside that subtree -- I've got a little
    list.  But it's no problem to take care of this one first.

    [PATCH] USB UHCI: restore more state following PM resume
    
    Some systems don't save the internal state of the UHCI registers across a
    PM suspend/resume cycle very well.  This patch saves & restores the
    Frame Number and the Framelist Base Address registers (in addition to the
    Interrupt Enable register, which was added separately in a recent patch.)

    [PATCH] USB: Remove interface/altsettings assumption from audio driver
    
    This patch updates the USB audio class driver to use the usb_ifnum_to_if()
    and usb_altnum_to_altsetting() routines, thereby removing assumptions
    about which interface or altsetting is stored in which array entry.
    
    It also simplifies the driver's probe() routine by using the raw
    configuration descriptor already loaded into memory instead of reading the
    descriptor from the device.  Now, either the current driver has a bug and
    never deallocates the buffer used to hold the descriptor, or else I've
    introduced a double-free error.  There's no obvious place where the buffer
    gets freed, but it's hard to be certain.
    
    It would be good if someone could try out this patch.  I can't test it,
    not having any USB audio devices handy.  If the double-free error is
    present, it will show up when the device is disconnected and the
    configuration data is released.

    This patch makes the necessary updates to the bluetty, cdc-acm, and usblp

    quite small.
    
    Unfortunately, the audio and usb-midi drivers are in much worse shape.
    They will require more in-depth hacking, to come later...

    SCSI: implement transport attributes for 53c700
    
    his patch moves the internal storage of the offset and period to the
    transport class and adds methods to set them (there's no need for a get
    method since the value in the transport class is exactly what the driver
    believes the transport agreement to be).
    
    You can see how this type of use of the transport class is supposed to
    work: the driver now has init and exit routines attaching and releasing
    the transport class (that's the reason for the Makefile perturbation
    because it has to init before its users).  The correct attributes are
    set up in slave_configure() for negotiation and we now export the period
    and offset setting functions.

    SCSI: Make SPI transport attributes mutable
    
    This adds the final missing piece to the transport attributes:  A
    published API by which they can be set and retrieved (SPI attributes
    only).  The sysfs field only appears writeable if the driver supplied a
    set method in the attribute template, so unsettable attributes show up
    as read only.
    
    The consequence now is that the spi transport attribute class is no
    longer a simple exported structure: the driver has to attach to the spi
    transport class at module initialisation.

    Yes, someone really was stupid enough to make a device with
    such a dumb vendor name. In combination with the device name
    and rev number though, it shouldn't cause any false positives.
    
    Device in question is some no-name 6-in-1 usb card reader,
    whose slots all appear on different LUNs, requiring you
    fiddle with scis_mod's max_luns argument unless you have this patch.

    This is part of a patch series to clean up sound/core/Makefile in Linux

    - Add 'select SND_PCM' statements to appropriate Kconfig entries for
      drivers whose configuration symbol is used to build snd-pcm,
      snd-timer, and snd-page-alloc.
    
    - Remove snd-pcm, snd-timer and snd-page-alloc from these in
      sound/core/Makefile.
    
    - Remove snd from these entries as well - all SND_xxx configuration
      symbols depend on CONFIG_SND, so we won't even consider building
      any of these drivers unless SND is already set to 'y' or 'm'.

    This is part of a patch series to clean up sound/core/Makefile in Linux
    2.6.4-rc1.
    
    - Add SND_TIMER, SND_PCM, SND_HWDEP and SND_RAWMIDI configuration symbols.
      These symbols select which modules in sound/core get built, building
      snd-timer, snd-pcm, snd-hwdep and snd-rawmidi respectively.
    
    - Add reverse dependencies (select) to select these symbols for core
      components where necessary.
    
    - Hide SND_OSSEMUL - we can select this when SND_MIXER_OSS, SND_PCM_OSS
      or SND_SEQUENCER_OSS are selected automatically.
    
    - Tweak Makefile to use these new symbols to build these modules.
    
    - Since we now build appropriate modules for core components according
      to the new configuration symbols, (eg, snd-timer if SND_SEQUENCER is
      selected) we can delete these duplications.

    [PATCH] SCSI Midlayer initiated START_UNIT
    
    The ipr driver that is currently out for review talks to disk array devices
    that require a START_UNIT prior to media ops, similar to normal scsi devices.
    However, any time the adapter gets reset, these devices end up needing another
    START_UNIT. This causes problems with the current error handling and these
    devices get taken offline when this occurs. Attached is a patch which will
    better handle these devices and issue a START_UNIT from the error handler
    when appropriate.

    [PATCH] add missing free sgtable in scsi_init_io error path
    
    I was testing different errors while running multipath, and becuase of
    a bug in dm-multiapth I hit the "Incorrect number of segments after
    building list" error. The attached patch just adds a missing
    scsi_release_buffers() at the bottom of the scsi_init_io where the
    table was allocated successfully, but you can return BLKPREP_KILL when
    someone messes up segment counts.

    [PATCH] USB: HCD names, for better troubleshooting
    
    See the attached patch -- which restores the behavior of usbcore
    to what it had before "struct device.name" went away, in the
    (typical) case of PCI devices.
    
    It makes the root hubs say what hardware they're actually using,
    in the reasonably typical case that PCI names are in use, rather
    than being just generic (and hence almost useless) strings.  This
    sort of information can really help when troubleshooting.

    [PATCH] I2C: keep i2c-dev numbers in sync with i2c adapter numbers
    
    This makes userspace tools easier to figure out which i2c-dev device is
    assigned to which i2c adapter.
    
    Yes, we can overflow the i2c dev array right now, but that would take a
    lot of i2c adapter modprobe/rmmod cycles.  That will be fixed up soon.

    [PATCH] ia64: Don't assume iosapic interrupt controllers
    
    Some ia64 machines don't use an iosapic interrupt controller (a
    flagrant violation of the DIG64 spec), so don't assume it's there in
    mca.c.  Platforms that provide a ACPI_INTERRUPT_CPEI vector are
    responsible for registering its interrupt controller type in platform
    specific code, iosapic.c:iosapic_register_platform_intr() does this
    for platforms with an iosapic where the CPEI vector is listed in the
    ACPI namespace, and on sn2, all external interrupts are assigned the
    irq_type_sn type, so this change of assumption should be safe.

    [PATCH] USB: Convert usbtest to the new altsetting regime
    
    This patch converts the usbtest driver to the new way altsettings work.
    The largest change is to remove the assumptions that altsetting numbers
    lie in the correct range (a debugging message is logged if they don't but
    execution doesn't stop) and that the array is sorted by number.

    [PATCH] USB: Convert usb-storage to use cur_altsetting
    
    I'm beginning the process of converting device drivers to use
    cur_altsetting with usb-storage, the one I know best.  Only a few changes
    are needed (and the first one isn't even really necessary).

    [PATCH] USB: Small improvements for devio.c
    
    devio.c doesn't need to be changed to support the new altsetting
    mechanism, but while looking through it I noticed a couple of places that
    could be improved slightly.  Here they are, just removal of some redundant
    tests (all altsettings for the same interface are guaranteed to have the
    same bInterfaceNumber) and function calls.

    [PATCH] USB: Convert usbcore to use cur_altsetting
    
    This patch continues the work of as209 by converting the rest of usbcore
    to use cur_altsetting in place of act_altsetting.  The changes required
    are fairly small, just in the sysfs attributes and hub configuration.

    Here's a start.  This patch begins the conversion process by adding
    usbcore support for cur_altsetting and deprecating act_altsetting.
    
    So long as we assumed that altsetting numbers range from 0 to
    num_altsetting-1 and that the number matches its index in the altsetting
    array, there was no harm in using act_altsetting.  But without that
    assumption act_altsetting is merely an invitation to errors.  Although the
    kerneldoc says that act_altsetting is the _index_ of the active
    altsetting, it's all too easy to confuse it with the _number_ of the
    active altsetting.  Using cur_altsetting instead (a pointer rather than a
    number) will prevent that confusion.
    
    Until all the drivers have been converted to use cur_altsetting, the core
    will have to maintain act_altsetting in parallel with it.  Eventually we
    will be able to remove act_altsetting, but fixing all the drivers will
    take a while.
    
    Included in this patch:
    
    	Add cur_altsetting to struct usb_interface and deprecate
    	act_altsetting.
    
    	Add comments and kerneldoc explaining the changes.  Also remove
    	the comments in front of struct usb_host_config (they seem to
    	have been left behind when usb_ch9.h was split out) and add
    	kerneldoc for that structure.
    
    	Add usb_altnum_to_altsetting() to help look up altsettings based
    	on their number.
    
    	Convert the usb_set_interface(), usb_set_configuration(), and
    	usb_reset_configuration() routines to support cur_altsetting
    	and act_altsetting in parallel.  Convert a few others to use
    	cur_altsetting rather than act_altsetting.
    
    	Rename a few local variables to make their meaning a little
    	clearer.  It would be nice to change struct usb_host_interface
    	to something like usb_host_altsetting, but that's a patch for
    	another time.

    The driver model does not support repeated device_add(), device_del(),
    device_add(), device_del(), ... calls for the same device.  But that's
    what happens to an interface's embedded struct device when we change
    configurations.
    
    Accordingly, this patch changes the device_add()/device_del() calls for
    interfaces to device_register()/device_unregister().  When the interface
    is unregistered the new code waits for the release method to run, so that
    it will be safe to re-register the interface should the former
    configuration be reinstated.
    
    Greg, please check this out to make sure I haven't made some dumb mistake.
    It works on my system and it fixes a memory leak in the USB system.

    [PATCH] USB Gadget: make usb gadget strings talk utf-8
    
    Teach gadget/usbstring to expect UTF-8 strings, not ISO-8859/1 ones.
    This just gets rid of an API issue:  no hacks needed for non-Western
    languages, and multi-language support will be lots easier.
    
    Current drivers won't notice the API change, they use US-ASCII (which
    is a strict superset of both encodings).
    
    Future drivers may want to teach utf8_to_utf16le() about the four-byte
    encodings, so they can emit surrogate pairs for those Unicode characters.

    [PATCH] USB Storage: unusual_devs.h entry submission
    
    here is an unusual_devs.h entry which makes two different USB MP3 players
    work with Linux' USB storage driver. They share a core chip, the t33520 USB
    flash card controller by Trumpion microelectronics. They also share the same
    ID 0x090a:0x1001, which is a "generic" ID for t33520 devices using bulk-only
    protocol (0x1002 is for CB).
    
    About the MP3 players:
      - I own an apparently unbranded one (sold in masses on ebay.de) which
        needs US_FL_MODE_XLATE (and used to need US_FL_START_STOP before its
        removal).
      - Theodore Kilgore (who created the 0x090a:0x1001 record in the
        Linux-USB device overwiew) has a "Trumpion Digital Research MYMP3"
        which needs US_FL_MODE_XLATE and an explicit US_PR_BULK.
    Of course the different players report the same firmware rev. 1.00,
    despite their obviously different behaviour. Ugh.
    
    There are more players with this ID, the "Kaser Yofun 100 MP-3" (also

    [PATCH] ia64: Add support for extended PCI config space
    
    Support for extended config space on ia64.
    
     - Add the new parameter 'type' to ia64_sal_pci_config_{read,write}
     - Change callers to match.
     - Don't check `value' for NULL -- drivers/pci/access.c guarantees it isn't.
     - Make pci_sal_ops static.
     - Add pci_sal_ext_ops.
     - Introduce pci_set_sal_ops() as an arch_initcall to ensure the raw_pci_ops
       get set before we walk the ACPI namespace to discover PCI root bridges

     - Introduce sal_revision to report what revision of the SAL spec is
       supported by the system.
     - Introduce sal_version to report what version of the vendor's SAL
       implementation is present.
     - Introduce SAL_VERSION_CODE to allow for easy comparisons.
     - Print the version at boot, and remove the 'oem=' and 'vendor=' strings.
     - Refactor ia64_sal_init() into several smaller functions.
     - Delete the dead variables 'max' and 'min'.
     - Stop printing the pal_proc and sal_proc entry addresses.
     - Print "None" if there are no SAL platform features.

    * Do not reset the registers unless users want to do because
      resetting registers makes all fans go to full power and we can

    ia64: minor 2.6 sba_iommu update
    
    This is a minor update to sba_iommu initialization code.  I moved the
    relaxed ordering to the zx1 specific init routine, those registers don't
    do anything on sx1000.  The iommu page size setup is more generalized on
    ACPI ID, so the sx1000 specific init routine goes away.  And the virtual
    dma_mask on zx1 was tweaked a little to better reflect the memory
    address space.

    [PATCH] USB: add new USB Touchscreen Driver
    
    I have attached a patch which contains a driver and documentation for
    the MicroTouch (14-206) USB Capacitive Touchscreen controller.  It based
    on some older code that I have been using for quite some time now (since
    2.4.17).  This new version has been completely re-written, and now uses
    Linux Input.  Greg, It would be great to possibly get it into 2.6.4.
    Please let me know if I have it all wrong...
    
    Unfortunately, the X11 mouse driver only seems capable of handling
    relative data rather than absolute.  Hopefully some one will create a
    suitable X11 driver capable of accepting absolute data from Linux
    Input.  If anyone is aware of one, please let me know.  Otherwise, I
    will most likely begin some work on a patch for GPM.
    
    Calibration support will be on the way soon, but I'm not sure of the
    best way to implement.  Perhaps some abstract functions could come
    available in evdev which can call vendor specific commands for the
    calibration within this driver (and perhaps others).

    pressure rather than clicks.

    [PATCH] USB: EHCI and full-speed ISO-OUT
    
    This is a minor update to the patch I sent out about a week ago.
    The key change is to use the I/O watchdog while doing ISO streaming.
    Bernd Porr reports that a VT8235 system needs that; it seems like
    IDE activity can interfere with the delivery of USB IRQs.
    
    
    EHCI periodic scheduling updates.
    
     - Initial version of full speed ISO transaction support.  This
       should handle OUT transactions, such as those for usb speakers.
       For now, it's controlled using an EXPERIMENTAL config option:
    
       * I've run into interesting differences in how different USB 2.0
         hub silicon (the transaction translators) handle some older
         audio devices.  Needs more investigation.
    
       * Interrupt transfer scheduling doesn't yet cope well with schedules
         where every slot already has activity.  For now, don't plug in
         devices like hubs, mice, or keyboards while EHCI is streaming.
    
     - Protect freelist for highspeed ITDs, using spinlock.  Could be
       an issue for some drivers.
    
     - Kick in the I/O watchdog timer (5 msec) for periodic transfers.
       In this case, IDE activity on a VT8235 lost the IRQs which should
       have kept the ISO stream active.  Queues shorter than 5 msec are
       not going to work on all USB hosts.
    
     - Simplified the ISO scheduler:  doesn't attempt to re-schedule
       after lossage, or to short-circuit scanning.  (Rescheduling will
       probably come back later ... for now, the "hard" error here is
       highlighting problems that need attention.)

    [PATCH] USB Gadget: gadget config buffer utilities
    
    Adds two new gadget-side utility functions, to support a declarative
    style of managing usb configuration descriptors.  The functions fill
    buffers from null-terminated vectors of usb descriptors, which are
    simple to build or update.
    
    The "ethernet" gadget driver currently has the most interesting config
    descriptors.  This uses those functions to replace some complex code with
    simpler static declarations; result, it's cleaner.  (And it'll be easier
    to add RNDIS configurations later, too.)
    
    Memory savings (or cost, depending on config) was less than 50 bytes;
    nothing worth worrying about.

    [PATCH] USB: Fix for kl5kusb105 driver
    
    I tried using the kl5kusb105 driver for a 3Com PalmConnect USB device I
    had lying around.
    
    It oopses during device detection. There is a nested loop using the same
    loop counter as the outer loop - causing the code after the nested loop
    is first executed to have an invalid counter. The counter is then used
    as an array index, causing a NULL deref.
    
    Fix attached.

    [PATCH] USB Storage: Fix for Fuji Finepix 1400
    
    This patch changes some error checking so that some bogus devices (like the
    Fuji Finepix 1400) will work.
    
    This is basically relaxing a test on a field that the spec says "should
    always be zero"

    Quite right; this is needless complexity.  (But note you left in a couple

    [PATCH] USB: Return better result codes in UHCI
    
    This patch changes the result code returned by the UHCI driver for a
    certain class of errors.  Under a number of circumstances a USB device is
    obliged to send a response packet within a fairly short turn-around time,
    typically 1 - 10 microseconds depending on the bus speed.  Failure to do
    so is a protocol error and should be reported as such, not as a timeout,
    which is really a higher-level concept.  I believe the EHCI driver already
    does this.
    
    I trust nobody will object to the update this patch adds to
    Documentation/usb/error-codes.txt, making this more explicit.
    
    In a vaguely related change, the patch corrects the terminology in a few
    comments.  The parts of a control transfer are called "stages", not
    "phases".

    This patch re-initializes the UHCI Interrupt Enable register following a
    PM resume.  Apparently some systems clear the register during suspend,
    which causes obvious problems later on.

    Wonderful.  Thanks a lot for all your SMP testing, it's been a big help.
    
    
    This patch corrects an error in the dequeueing code for UHCI.  Improper
    locking caused it to hang in the oddball case where an URB was unlinked
    even before it had been queued.

    [PATCH] I2C: rename sysfs files, part 2 of 2
    
    Here is the second step of my sysfs renaming plan.
    
    This one does the following renames (as I already announced on the
    LKML):
    temp<n>_hyst  -> temp<n>_max_hyst or temp<n>_crit_hyst
    sensor<n>     -> temp<n>_type
    pwm<n>        -> fan<n>_pwm
    pwm<n>_enable -> fan<n>_pwm_enable
    vid           -> in<n>_ref
    
    The associated libsensors patch is here:
    http://jdelvare.net1.nerim.net/sensors/libsensors-sysfs-names-2.diff
    (not applied yet, on purpose)
    
    
    Note that the w83781d part is a bit more complex, not only because it is
    the only driver to require the 5 changes, but also because at some point
    the macros assume that the internal variable names match the sysfs
    names, so I had to change them too (better than rewriting the macros,
    methinks).
    
    For reference, here is the list of changes, by driver:
    
    asb100:
        hyst -> max_hyst (4)
        pwm -> fan_pwm (1)
        pwm_enable -> fan_pwm_enable (1)
        vid -> in_ref (1)
    fscher:
         pwm -> fan_pwm (3)
    gl518sm:
        hyst -> max_hyst (1)
    it87:
        sensor -> temp_type (3)
    lm75:
        hyst -> max_hyst (1)
    lm78:
        hyst -> max_hyst (1)
        vid -> in_ref (1)
    lm85:
        pwm -> fan_pwm (3)
        pwm_enable -> fan_pwm_enable (3)
        vid -> in_ref (1)
    lm90:
        hyst -> crit_hyst (2)
    via686a:
        hyst -> max_hyst (3)
    w83781d:
        hyst -> max_hyst (2)
        sensor -> temp_type (3)
        pwm -> fan_pwm (4)
        pwm_enable -> fan_pwm_enable (1)
        vid -> in_ref (1)
    
    There's also a documentation update. There will be one more after that
    (to make it more readable, no contents change), and a patch to lm83.c to
    bring it to compliance with the (new) standard. (If you wonder why I did
    not change it with the other drivers: because it was *already* not in
    compliance with the old standard. There's some real work to do for this
    one.)

    * Better comments.

    [PATCH] I2C: fix Hangs with w83781d
    
    Here is a patch for the w83781d driver that prevents register bits from
    being arbitrary changed when we force temp2/3 to comparator mode. Keith
    Duthie had been reporting various problems with that driver and finally
    found that this arbitrary change was the cause of them. He also tested
    this patch, which he confirmed to work.

    While we're at it, what about fixing two other drivers that obviously
    have the same problem?
    
    (BTW I didn't get an oops as I tried reproducing the problem, only a
    "Trying to free nonexistent resource" in dmesg.)

    [PATCH] I2C:  i2c-voodoo3.c needs I2C_ADAP_CLASS_TV_ANALOG
    
    The Voodoo3 i2c bus has either a bt869 tv-out chip, or also a tv tuner,
    decoder and msp3400.  Without I2C_ADAP_CLASS_TV_ANALOG, the i2c clients
    would have to do a strcmp of the adapter name to distiguish between the
    i2c and ddc adapters.  Yes, they should be able to tell if the chip at a
    given address is what they are looking for, but in the case of the v3tv
    module, which is the v4l device, in the 2.4 kerenl I've got it set to
    create a dummy client, and the strcmp is the only way to distinguish the
    i2c from the ddc.  In the 2.6 kernel, class can be defined, simplifying
    things for the v3tv module.
