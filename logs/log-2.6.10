    Don't use "-march=pentium3" for gcc tuning.
    
    rth tells me that some versions of gcc may end up using the
    SSE registers for data movement when you do that.
    
    Use "-march=i686 -mtune=xxxx" instead.
    
    (We do the same thing for march=pentium2/4 too, just for
    consistency).

    evdev, joydev, mousedev, tsdev - remove class device and devfs entry when
    hardware driver disconnects instead of waiting for the last user to drop off.
    This way hardware drivers can be unloaded at any time.

    [PATCH] fix inlining related build failures in mxser.c
    
    This fixes a build failure with gcc-3.4.1, where we use some functions
    before we define them inline.
    
    The simple way to fix those is to simply un-inline the functions in
    question. Since they are somewhat large that's what I did.
    
    An alternative would be to rework the ordering of the file so the
    functions are defined before their first use.

    [PATCH] Bring Moxa serial back into being
    
    Moxa have released several driver updates now including support up to
    2.6.8 but don't themselves feel its worth the effort of doing a cleaned
    up merge for the base kernel.  So I pulled their latest driver release
    (1.8) and removed all the macro gunge that makes it build on
    2.2.0->2.6.8.  I then fixed it to run on 2.6.9/10 and fixed a bug in the
    break handling.
    
    It still doesn't do PCI hotplug but I don't have any PCI moxa cards to
    really tackle that particular case.

    [PATCH] back out CPU clock additions to posix-timers
    
    This patch reverts the additions of an ABI supporting thread and process
    CPU clocks in the posix-timers code.  This returns us to 2.6.9's condition,
    there is no support for any new clockid_t values for process CPU clocks.
    
    This also fixes the return value for clock_nanosleep when unsupported (I
    think this is used only by sgi-timer at the moment).  The POSIX-specified
    code for valid clocks that don't support the sleep operation is ENOTSUP.
    On most architectures the kernel doesn't define ENOTSUP and this name is
    defined in userland the same as the kernel's EOPNOTSUPP.

    [PATCH] x86_64: fix syscall/signal restart bug
    
    Fix a pretty bad bug that caused sometimes signals on x86-64
    to be restarted like system calls. This corrupted the RIP and
    in general caused undesirable effects.
    
    The problem happens because orig_rax is unsigned on x86-64,
    but it originally was signed when the signal code was written.
    And the if (orig_rax >= 0) ended up always true.
    And gcc didn't warn about this, because the warning is only in
    -Wextra.
    
    In 2.4 we still had a cast for it, but somehow it got dropped
    in 2.5.
    
    Credit goes to John Slice for tracking it down and Erich Boleyn
    for the original fix. All blame to me. I fixed it at another
    place too.

    This should go in before 2.6.10. It fixes a forgotten case to provide
    police backward compatibility statistics for old iproute2 versions

    happy with older iproute2 versions and all-included kernel configs
    since they probably favour actions over plain policer.

    [PATCH] ppc64: fix signal mask restoration when delivery fails
    
    This is the third of 3 patches from David Woodhouse which fix various
    problems with signal handling on ppc64.
    
    At present, if a signal is being delivered, and the process has specified
    delivery of that signal on an alternate stack but the alternate stack that
    has been specified is invalid (i.e.  the kernel gets a fault writing to the
    alternate stack), then we (correctly) give the process a SIGSEGV but we put
    the wrong signal mask in the saved state on the stack - i.e.  we put the
    mask that would have been established for the original signal handler
    there.
    
    This patch fixes it by making setup_rt_frame, handle_rt_signal32 and
    handle_signal32 return a status code to indicate whether they successfully
    established a stack frame.  If they fail, the caller doesn't block the
    signals specified for the signal handler.

    [PATCH] ppc64: fix single-stepping into/out of signal handlers
    
    This is the second of 3 patches from David Woodhouse which fix various
    problems with signal handling on ppc64.
    
    The problem that this patch fixes is that a process being single-stepped
    will execute one instruction too many in certain cases: when a signal is
    delivered, when a signal handler returns, and when a system call
    instruction is single-stepped.  This patch fixes it by checking if the
    process is being single-stepped in the syscall exit path and on signal
    delivery, and stopping it if so.  To avoid slowing down the syscall exit
    path in the normal case, we use a bit in the thread_info flags, which can
    be tested along with the other bits we already test in the syscall exit
    path.

    [PATCH] ppc64: fix signal handler arguments
    
    This is the first of 3 patches from David Woodhouse which fix various
    problems with signal handling on ppc64.  (This is David's patch plus a
    couple of comment fixes from me.)
    
    Without this patch, a signal handler that is called as a result of delivery
    of a signal while a process is waiting in sigsuspend() will have wrong
    values given to it for the second and third arguments.  The reason is that
    we were returning to userspace via the syscall return path, which doesn't
    bother to restore r4 and r5.  This patch arranges for the return to
    userspace to be done via ret_from_except in this case, which restores all
    registers.

    [PATCH] fix bogus ECHILD return from wait* with zombie group leader
    
    Klaus Dittrich observed this bug and posted a test case for it.
    
    This patch fixes both that failure mode and some others possible.  What
    Klaus saw was a false negative (i.e.  ECHILD when there was a child)
    when the group leader was a zombie but delayed because other children
    live; in the test program this happens in a race between the two threads
    dying on a signal.
    
    The change to the TASK_TRACED case avoids a potential false positive
    (blocking, or WNOHANG returning 0, when there are really no children
    left), in the race condition where my_ptrace_child returns zero.

    [PATCH] USB: avoid OHCI autosuspend on some boxes
    
    Don't try autosuspend if we think the hardware won't resume correctly
    from the OHCI suspend state.  This makes the RWC bit serve double duty,
    but that appears to work OK, and the only penalty is increased power
    consumption (from OHCI clocks) on boards/chips that don't work right.
    
    For example, the amd756 erratum 4 workaround needs this logic; and at
    least one ServerWorks box issues spurious resume IRQs (~3x/second!)
    in the suspend state.

    [PATCH] correct dma_set_mask return code in DMA-API.txt
    
    The documentation says dma_set_api() returns 1 on success and
    0 on error, which is plain wrong, standard kernel return codes
    are used instead (0 on ok, -ESOMETHING on error).

    [PATCH] enable meye even when CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G=y
    
    The meye hardware needs to access the main memory for DMA using
    32 bit addresses. The previous version of the meye driver used
    dma_addr_t types to build those addresses and ensured that
    sizeof(dma_addr_t) = 4 by disabling HIGHMEM64G in Kconfig.
    
    However, this way of doing it also makes meye unavailable on
    some kernel configurations. As Arjan said previously, future Fedora
    kernels may have HIGHMEM64G activated by default (davej says it won't
    happen, at least for now...). Other distributions may do the same and
    this will require meye users to recompile the whole kernel.
    
    The attached patch makes the meye driver use dma_addr_t addresses
    internally, but converts them to u32 before giving them to the
    hardware.

    [IPV4/IPV6]: IGMP source filter fixes
    
    When adding or deleting from the source list make sure to find matches
    by comparing against the new source address, not the group address.
    Also, check each addr in the list rather than just the first one.
    And, finally, only delete from list when there's a match rather than
    vice-versa.  Drop the effort to keep list sorted, since it's not done
    on full-state api and can create an sl_addr entry that the delta api
    won't be able to delete. Without these fixes sl_count can be corrupted
    which can allow for kernel memory corruption.

    [PATCH] documentation for mem=
    
    I recently learnt that limiting RAM with by using only "mem=xxxM" is no
    good on machines equipped with PCI.  In my case (vanilla 2.6.9) the cardbus
    bridge on my laptop got mapped to the unused RAM area which resulted in
    wierd errors due to the collision.
    
    The right solution is to use "mem=" together with "memmap=" to mark the
    unused RAM area reserved.
    
    Henceforth I force the kernel to use 2016MiB by passing "mem=2016M
    memmap=32M#2016M" instead of just "mem=2016M".

    [PATCH] Add missing __KERNEL__ (or other) protections
    
    As of 2.6.10-rc3, the following is needed to allow various userland
    packages (sysvinit, dhcp, ppp, libcap, libpcap, lilo) to compile as parts
    that userland needs (e.g.  for ioctls) is in files with stuff userland
    isn't allowed to see.
    
    This adds __KERNEL__ around <linux/ata.h> and some defines (<linux/ata.h>
    isn't needed by userland, and is unhappy right now).  sysvinit and some
    other packages need <linux/hdreg.h> for HDIO_DRIVE_CMD and other IOCTL
    things.  In <linux/types.h> we were unsafely typedef'ing __le64/__be64 as
    __u64 only exists when __GNUC__ && !__STRICT_ANSI__ (causing libcap to
    fail, for example).  Finally, <asm/atomic.h> provides routines userland
    simply cannot use on all arches, but <linux/filter.h> is needed by iputils
    for example.  While not all arches put __KERNEL__ around their header, on
    MIPS including this header currently blows up the build.

    It turns out there are more issues with our VPA code:
    
    1. vpa_init doesnt report errors when it fails.  This was masking a bug
       where the VPA spanned 2 pages and phyp failed to register it.
    
    2. We call idle_setup before we initialise the boot cpus vpa.  This
       means we never select the shared processor idle loop.
    
    3. We dont call vpa_init on UP kernels.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Workaround PCI issue on g5
    
    ppc64 has a global called "pci_probe_only" which, when set, prevents the
    arch PCI code from calling pci_assign_unassigned_resources().  This was
    cleared by pmac so far, but a bug in the definition of the variable make
    that ineffective until 2.6.10, and so we never called
    pci_assign_unassigned_resources().
    
    With 2.6.10, that bug was fixed and so we now call it, which results in
    some problems.  Some devices who have perfectly valid assigned addresses by
    firmware end up beeing moved around anyway, which is a BAD thing can can
    break boot on some machines since it breaks the relationship between
    addresses in Open Firmware device-tree and actual location of PCI devices.
    (Some low level things like the PIC are ioremap'ed based on their OF
    address, way before the PCI based ASIC hosting them has been found).  This
    also break the "offb" default framebuffer driver since the video card ends
    up beeing moved around as well.
    
    For now, the fix is to set pci_probe_only on pmac, thus reverting to the
    old behaviour.  In the long run, it would be interesting to "fix"
    pci_assign_unassigned_resources() so that it does what it's name claims,
    and only assigns things that have been left unassigned instead of moving
    things around gratuituously...

    [PATCH] VmLib wrapped: executable brk
    
    In some cases /proc/<pid>/status shows VmLib: 42949..... kB.
    
    If READ_IMPLIES_EXEC then the break area is VM_EXEC, but omitted from
    exec_vm since do_brk contains no __vm_stat_account call.  Later munmaps
    count its pages out of exec_vm, hence (exec_vm - VmExe) can go negative.
    
    do_brk is right not to call __vm_stat_account, its pages shouldn't need to
    be counted.  What's wrong is that __vm_stat_account is counting all the
    VM_EXEC pages, whereas (to mimic 2.4 and earlier 2.6) it should be leaving
    VM_WRITE areas and non-vm_file areas out of exec_vm.
    
    VmLib may still appear larger than before - where a READ_IMPLIES_EXEC
    personality makes what was a readonly mapping of a file now executable e.g.
     /usr/lib/locale stuff.  And a program which mprotects its own text as
    writable will appear with wrapped VmLib: sorry, but while it's worth
    showing ordinary programs as ordinary, it's not worth much effort to avoid
    showing odd ones as odd.

    [PATCH] shmctl SHM_LOCK perms
    
    Michael Kerrisk has observed that at present any process can SHM_LOCK any
    shm segment of size within process RLIMIT_MEMLOCK, despite having no
    permissions on the segment: surprising, though not obviously evil.  And any
    process can SHM_UNLOCK any shm segment, despite no permissions on it: that
    is surely wrong.
    
    Unless CAP_IPC_LOCK, restrict both SHM_LOCK and SHM_UNLOCK to when the
    process euid matches the shm owner or creator: that seems the least
    surprising behaviour, which could be relaxed if a need appears later.

    [PATCH] reduce ext3 log spamming (blank lines)
    
    When drives go offline, e.g.  usb-storage disconnect, the upper layers
    don't behave very intelligently yet: ext3 over scsi keeps retrying reads,
    logging three lines for each error:
    
    10:58:31  scsi0 (0:0): rejecting I/O to dead device
    10:58:31  EXT3-fs error (device sda1): ext3_find_entry: reading directory #18089296 offset 0
    10:58:31
    10:59:47  EXT3-fs error (device sda1): ext3_find_entry: reading directory #18089296 offset 0
    
    This patch shrinks that log spam by the trivial third, getting rid of those
    needless blank lines.  It's not clear to me why the "no such device" errors
    don't immediately make ext3 (or is it the block layer?) give up ...  maybe
    someone else can make Linux not retry after those errors.

    [PATCH] ppc64: make UP kernel run on POWER4 logical partition
    
    Recently I tried booting a UP kernel on a 1-processor logical partition on
    a POWER4 system.  It failed because the CPU we happened to be running on
    was CPU 2, but hard_smp_processor_id() is defined to 0 for !CONFIG_SMP.
    (Note that this code runs quite early, as part of init_IRQ, so
    hard_smp_processor_id() should be the physical ID of the boot cpu.)
    
    This patch does a minimal fix to make it work.  I think this patch should
    go in 2.6.10.  Ultimately I think the hard_smp_processor_id() definition
    should be removed from include/linux/smp.h, but that carries a risk of
    breaking other architectures and probably shouldn't be done pre 2.6.10.

    [PATCH] highmem.c: fix bio error propagation
    
    Found a subtle bug that caused mount errors on a SATA drive with
    barriers on reiser and ext3, where it should have recovered and just
    turned off barriers. The problem is that the EOPNOTSUPP error isn't
    being propagated properly to the bounced bio. This patch fixes that by
    correctly passing error all the way down.

    [PATCH] ppc64: make sure lppaca doesn't cross page boundary
    
    This patch is from Will Schmidt <willschm@us.ibm.com>, with some extra
    comments from me.
    
    On iSeries and on POWER5 machines, there is a data structure which is
    used for communication between the hypervisor and the kernel, called
    the `lppaca'.  The kernel tells the hypervisor where it is, and the
    hypervisor requires that it doesn't cross a page boundary.  With other
    changes in the last few months we have ended up with a situation where
    it could cross a page boundary.  This patch increases the alignment
    requirement for the struct to make sure that it can't cross a page
    boundary.
    
    This is a bug fix and should go into 2.6.10.

    [ide] ide-cd: fix possible race in PIO mode
    
    From: Alan Cox <alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk>
    
    When we issue an ide command the status bits don't become valid for
    400nS. In the DMA case ide_execute_command handles this but in the PIO
    case we don't do the needed locking, use OUTBSYNC to avoid posting or
    delay. This means that in some situations we can execute the command
    handler in PIO mode before the command status bits are valid and the
    handler may read and act wrongly.

    The problem is caused because the object tying of the upper device

    (yes, this is my fault).  Releasing an upper driver can generate I/O
    which is a bit of a problem if you already dropped the last reference to
    the scsi_device.

    [PATCH] hack imm.c to work in highmem machines
    
    Currently imm uses page_address() which can crash on highmem. It's not
    directly doable to map the pages properly, at least not without
    changing some code. In lack of a ->bounce_highio member in the scsi
    host template, just set ->unchecked_isa_dma which will just bounce
    everything for us. imm isn't performance critical by any stretch of
    the imagination, so...
    
    Usually I'd not encourage such a silly hack, but in lack of hardware for
    testing (who has it??), this should suffice as it is obviously correct.

    [NETFILTER]: TCP window tracking bug fixes.
    
    1) Name IP_CT_TCP_STATE_FLAG_WINDOW_SCALE more consistently.
    2) Client sends SYN, server responds with SYN/ACK.  However
       the SYN/ACK is lost in transit and the client keeps
       sending the SYNs.  The server times out, restarts, and
       sends SYN/ACK with new sequence numbers.  Those packets
       were however erroneously dropped by the window tracking code.
    3) NFS client and server, client crashes and connects to the
       server from the same port as before the crash.  Server
       thinks the connection is still alove and sends an ACK,
       client responds with a RST and tears down the connection
       so that it can start a new one.  That was not handled by
       the previous code.
    4) Occasionally the window tracking code logged BUG lines due
       to a leftover ack instead of sack in the logging part.

    [IA64] delete offsets.h in mrproper, not in clean rule
    
    Patch from Tigran Aivazian:
    On IA64 architecture the "make clean" does not correspond to its
    definition:
    
    # make clean     Delete most generated files
    #                Leave enough to build external modules
    
    because it deletes include/asm-ia64/offsets.h file which can easily be
    included by a module, e.g. via this header path:
    
    In file included from include/linux/thread_info.h:21,
    from include/linux/spinlock.h:12,
    from include/linux/capability.h:45,
    from include/linux/sched.h:7,
    from include/asm/uaccess.h:37,
    
    So the fix is to remove this file from CLEAN_FILES and add it to
    MRPROPER_FILES, so that it is NOT removed by "make clean" and removed by
    "make mrproper".

    [PATCH] USB: sl811-hcd driver, replaces hc_sl811
    
    This patch provides a new "sl811-hcd" driver, which should replace the older
    one from Cypress (which has been broken for ages, even on SA-1100).
    
    Key features of this new driver:
    
     - Small, relatively tight code;
     - Uses the 2.6 platform_device and usbcore HCD infrastructures;
     - Compiles (x86, ARM) and works (ARM/PXA255);
     - Passed a day's worth of "usbtest" stress testing (on 2.6.9).
    
    I've enumerated over a dozen different devices with it, and actually tested
    mice, hubs, keyboards, and usb-storage.  There's a hardware erratum that
    prevents this chip from working with certain external hubs.  There's scope
    yet for some performance work here; and some IRQ quirks linger.
    
    This PIO-only driver should serve as a model for some other non-DMA USB host
    controllers (like isp1161, isp1362, td243) used in embedded Linuxes ... in
    particular, showing how to maintain async and periodic schedules without
    pointless emulation of OHCI DMA queues and/or registers.
    
    The driver should handle ISO, but since it doesn't implement the special
    urb->iso_frame_desc[] "pseudo-queue" model (and since Linux can't guarantee
    low enough IRQ latencies!), ISO is disabled.

    This fix just makes the OHCI hub status reporting logic (used

    (keventd) finishes resuming the port, so they can't deadlock.

    [PATCH] USB: EHCI qh update race fix
    
    This makes the EHCI driver stop trying to update a live QH ... it's
    not like OHCI, that can't be done safely because of a hardware race.
    The fix:
    
        - Unlinks the QH before updating it; only the tail can safely be
          updated "live", not the queue head.  The async schedule (all
          control/bulk QHs) and periodic schedule (interrupt QH) work a
          bit differently ... high bandwidth transfers will hiccup.
    
        - Moves "update QH" and "clear toggle" logic into one new
          qh_refresh() routine, used in several places.
    
    The race shows readily enough under load with the right hardware.
    The controller silicon might be relatively slow, or maybe it's the
    bus that's slow/busy:
    
    	Host			Controller
    	---			----------
    				reads two TD pointers
    	update two TD pointers
    	wmb()
    	activate QH
    				reads rest of QH
    
    Net result is that the HC treated old TD pointers as valid, and things
    started misbehaving.  Busy controllers would misbehave worse; some systems
    wouldn't notice more than a slowdown, especially with light USB loads.
    
    This affects behavior in two cases.  The uncommon one is when an endpoint
    gets an error and halts.  The more common one happens when the controller
    runs off the end of its queue and overlays an inactive "dummy" TD into
    the QH ... something the spec says shouldn't happen, but which more
    silicon seems to be doing.  (Presumably to reduce DMA chatter.)

    [PATCH] USB UHCI: minor bugfix for port resume
    
    This patch fixes two small problems in the port suspend/resume handling
    for the UHCI driver.  There were a couple of spots where I neglected to
    store I/O addresses in unsigned _long_ variables (required for 64-bit
    architectures).  And it turns out the host controller will continue to
    indicate a resume is in progress for a few microseconds after it has been
    turned off, so an extra delay is needed.

    [SPARC]: Adjust 32-bit ELF_ET_DYN_BASE.
    
    We were using 0x08000000 instead of TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE
    so that running something like "/lib/ld-linux.so.2 emacs"
    would work.
    
    The issue there was that wherever /lib/ld-linux.so.2 gets
    mapped (controlled by ELF_ET_DYN_BASE), that is where the
    BSS start for the process ends up.  Now, emacs allocates
    dynamic memory for LISP objects from the BSS, and needs
    the top 4 bits of the virtual address to be clear so that
    it can encode LISP type and GC marking information there.
    
    But making this obscure emacs case work breaks lots of other
    stuff.  For example, programs with a reasonably large data
    section fail to load via direct ld.so interpreter execution
    because the data section is large enough to begin overlapping
    with the ELF_ET_DYN_BASE area.
    
    The /lib/ld-linux.so.2 emacs case does not work on a lot of
    platforms due to this issue, including i386, so it is not
    worth making work on sparc either.  It is indeed useful
    sometimes when debugging a new experimental build of glibc
    for example, but people doing that can hack the value of
    ELF_ET_DYN_BASE in their kernels.  Perhaps at some point
    we will make a sysctl controllable value.

    USB changed behaviour of unlink_urb so that it gives warning and backtrace when
    being used synchronously. The correct current behaviour is to us kill_urb
    in that case.

    [PATCH] off-by-1 libata-scsi INQUIRY VPD pages 0x80 and 0x83
    
    I have some code (in sginfo) that requests the first 4 bytes
    of SCSI INQUIRY VPD pages to get their length then asks for
    that exact length in a follow up request to fetch the payload.
    Just like I saw with 36 byte standard INQUIRYs (no fixed)
    I get a buffer  full or zeroes.
    
    BTW SCSI standards dictate that in situations where the allocation
    length (in the cdb) is less than what is needed that what can be
    sent shall be sent (i.e. truncated and without any error indication
    or modification to the part of the response returned).
    In other words it is up the the application client to take remedial
    action.
    
    Changelog:
       - fix off-by-1 allocation length issue with SCSI
         INQUIRY VPD pages 0x80 and 0x83

    [libata] only DMA map data for DMA commands (fix >=4GB bug)
    
    libata made the assumption that (for PIO commands in this case)
    it could modify DMA memory at the kernel-virtual address, after
    mapping this.  This is incorrect, and fails on e.g. platforms that
    copy DMA memory back and forth (swiotlb on Intel EM64T and IA64).
    
    Remove this assumption by ensuring that we only call the DMA mapping
    routines if we really are going to use DMA for data xfer.
    
    Also:  remove a bogus WARN_ON() in ata_sg_init_one() which caused
    bug reports (but no problems).

    [PATCH] dvb: documentation update
    
    Start of a big DVB update.
    
    
    The reasons for revamping the DVB frontend architecture:
    
    Just as analog TV cards, DVB cards need some sort of tuner to tune to the
    desired frequency of the digital transponder.  Tuning alone doesn't give you a
    digital DVB datastream, however, you need a demodulator as well.  The
    combination of tuner and demodulator is called frontend in the DVB world.
    Tuner and demodulator are both accessed via the serial i2c bus on all DVB
    cards out there.  So, technically a frontend consists of two i2c helper
    chipsets.
    
    In former times when there was only a handful of different DVB cards, the
    frontend was encapsulated in one tin box.  Some people had the idea that there
    should be one "frontend driver" instead of dedicated tuner and demodulator
    drivers.  A bad idea.
    
    As time went on, different manufacturers used the same tuner and demodulator
    combination, but used a different wiring for the tuner or did other technical
    changes.  The only possibility to support different cards with one combined
    frontend driver was to add hardware dependent tuner code inside the generic
    i2c frontend drivers.  Yuck.
    
    So there was a need for communication between the i2c frontend driver and the
    hardware depenedent driver, for example to exchange initialization code for
    the tuner.  Unfortunately, the i2c infrastructure is one way, from the i2c
    client to the i2c adapter using a non-typesafe ioctl() like interface, which
    is ugly by itself.  Greg K-H and others refused the idea to add an iotctl()
    like interface from the i2c adapter to the i2c client and instead proposed to
    use a typesafe interface instead.  We all agreed with that.
    
    The existing i2c infrastructure heavily depends on the probing facility, ie.
    clients probe for their existence on i2c busses.  This is dumb for most i2c
    busses out there that sit on dedicated hardware.  A DVB card is uniquely
    identified with pci or usb subvendor and subsystem ids, so on that particular
    bus we exactly *know* which kinds of i2c helper chipsets sit on there.
    
    Up to now this wasn't a problem, because we could fix all conflicts manually
    until half a year ago.  By that date, we found two different DVB designs which
    used different demodulators that unfortunately use the same i2c address and
    which cannot be distinguished by hardware tricks (ie.  different number of
    registers, some fixed hw dependent register,...)
    
    Getting a usable DVB card depended on the load order of the modules, because
    the i2c core probed the demodulator drivers one after another and the first
    one won the race.  Compiling all drivers statically into the kernel resulted
    in non-working cards.
    
    Our solution is as follows: we agreed to keep the basic underlying kernel i2c
    infrastructure, but we decided not to register our bussed and chipsets to the
    kernel i2c "probing" infrastructure.  Instead, we killed the tuner parts of
    the frontend drivers and put them into the dedicated hardware drivers (this is
    were they technically belong, they are highly hardware dependent) and we
    changed the frontend drivers to pure demodulator drivers (which are hardware
    independend).  There is now a type-safe functional dependency between the
    drivers and the demodulator drivers, the drivers explicitely ask the
    demodulator drivers to attach to their i2c bus.  The only negative aspect of
    that approach is that for some hardware there are now more dependencies to
    demodulator drivers than needed, ie.  a small amount of memory is wasted.

    [PATCH] Blacklist devices that falsely claim an echo buffer
    
    A particular type of DVD is wrongly claiming to have an echo buffer
    (but only if a DVD is inserted).  This confuses domain validation, so
    only look for an echo buffer if the device supports ppr (this is all
    SCSI3 and above devices plus LVD SCSI2 devices).

    [PATCH] restore BLKRRPART semantics
    
    In 2.6.8 the code for the BLKRRPART ioctl was changed
    to return EIO when no partitions were found, such as
    on an empty disk. This breaks some partitioning programs
    and is also confusing: "Input/Output error" while in fact
    nothing was wrong with this brand new all blank disk.
    
    This restores old behaviour.

    [PATCH] PPC64 Close firmware stdin
    
    We recently found a problem that was causing memory corruption during
    boot on IBM POWER5 machines.  The problem was that the if you have a
    USB keyboard and it is set to the input device for the firmware, it
    will still be active when the kernel is started.  That means that the
    OHCI controller has pointers to various memory areas that it polls for
    transfers to do.  When we start using that same memory in the kernel,
    bad things can happen.  (This isn't a problem on powermacs because the
    Apple OF implements a "quiesce" call which turns off all the devices
    it is using.)
    
    This patch fixes the problem by calling the Open Firmware "close"
    method for the input device.  Stephen Rothwell and I have verified
    that doing this fixes the problem on the POWER5 machine where we
    observed it.  I verified that this patch doesn't cause any problems on
    powermacs.
    
    I think this patch should go into 2.6.10 since it fixes a nasty memory
    corruption bug that can cause rather subtle and hard-to-diagnose
    problems during boot.  (The symptom on the POWER5 machine with the
    particular kernel that we were using was that reading /proc/net/tcp
    would oops, due to one of the pointers in tcp_ehash being corrupted.)

    [ARM PATCH] 2297/1: SMC91x patch (#2) for LPD7a40x CardEngines
    
    Patch from Marc Singer
    
    Add support for the LPD7a40x implementation of the SMC91x ethernet
    controller. This patch exists to work around a mismatch between the
    way the LH7a40x CPUs handle chip selects and what the ethernet
    controller expects.
    
    This patch has been revised to eliminate masking of interrupts.  The
    concessions are that
    
      a) the ISR must perform an IOBARRIER before the first access to the
         chip, just in case the interrupt occurred while the driver was
         writing to the chip
      b) other drivers that use the same chip select region as the SMC
         chip must perform a similar IOBARRIER at the top of their ISRs.

    [PATCH] Fix ALSA resume
    
    Some time ago, a patch was merged that removed pci_save_state() and
    pci_restore_state() from various ALSA drivers. That patch also added
    pci_restore_state() to sound/core/init.c but didn't add pci_save_state()
    anywhere. This is needed since the core pci handling doesn't do this for
    us anymore.

    [SPARC64]: Fix SMP cpu bringup bug when bigkernel.
    
    We have to load the bigkernel second TLB entry on
    secondary processors before we move over the use
    the kernel trap table.  Otherwise we can take a
    TLB miss somewhere in the post-4MB area and the
    TLB handler is not prepared to service that.
    
    The case that usually occurs is the prom_set_trap_table
    call made by trampoline.S, since p1275buf usually sits
    very near the end of the kernel image.  It worked by
    luck most of the time as long as p1275buf sits within
    a single page since earlier code running in trampoline.S
    forced that TLB entry to be loaded by the OBP TLB miss
    handler.
    
    This was not fun to figure out.

    dereferencing them.  The task structure itself is guaranteed to be valid -

    [PATCH] fbdev: fix wrong colors at 16 bpp in tridentfb
    
    Timothy Lee reports:
    
    Hardware: CyberBlade/i1 on VIA Epia-800
    
    Problem Description:  When the framebuffer is set to 16 bpp, console's text
    colours are incorrect.  For example, white becomes yellow, black becomes blue, etc.
    
    Steps to reproduce:
    1. Load tridentfb
    2. Use "setterm -n -depth 16" to request 16 bpp framebuffer
    
    The problem arose from the fact that each psuedo palette entry should be
    32-bit in size, even under 16-bit display mode.

    [PATCH] Avoid deadlock in smc91x driver
    
    This patch avoids a deadlock on rtnl_sem in smc_close() when bringing down
    an smc91x interface.  The semaphore is already held by devinet_ioctl() and
    the pending work queue contains linkwatch_event() (scheduled by
    netif_carrier_off()) which also wants rtnl_sem hence it is unsafe to call
    flush_scheduled_work().
    
    The solution is to track whether we have any pending work of our own and
    wait for that instead of flushing the entire queue.
    
    I also fixed a typo 'ence' -> 'Hence' and renamed smc_detect_phy to
    smc_phy_detect in order to follow the same pattern as the other smc_phy_*
    functions.

    [PATCH] acpi_processor_idle() latency fix
    
    We check need_resched() _before_ disabling preemption.  This opens up the
    following scenario:
    
     swapper:	!need_resched()
     [IRQ context]
    		wakes up a task
    		marks idle task as need-resched
    
     swapper:	acpi_processor_idle(); // sleeps until next irq
    
    instant 1msec latency introduced...
    
    normally default_idle() is safe because it re-checks need_resched with
    interrupts disabled before it truly halts the CPU.  But

    [PATCH] Allow multiple cpus in irq affinity call
    
    The generic irq affinity code limits us to a single cpu target regardless
    of what the architecture supports.  If required this should be done in the
    architecture specific ->set_affinity call.
    
    With this patch ppc64 is able to select all cpus affinity again.

    [PATCH] blkdev_get_blocks(): handle eof
    
    For reasons which escape me, blockdev_get_blocks() is returning -EIO if the
    mapping request straddles the end of the disk.  This causes reads which
    straddle end-of-disk to return -EIO.
    
    Fix it up so that it correctly trims the returned result down to match the
    size of the device, for both reads and writes.
    
    If a write attempt is fully beyond end-of-device then return -EIO.  We never
    get this far anyway, because generic_write_checks() will return -ENOSPC if all
    of the write lies outside a blockdev's i_size.

    I've written two document files, and packaged them as a patch.
    
    Two things caught my eye while I was writing this up:
    
    The header comments for CDROMREADRAW, CDROMREADMODE1, and CDROMREADMODE2
    disagree with the actual source code.  The header comments imply that a
    cdrom_read structure is used to pass data, but the source code actually
    reads a cdrom_msf structure and then overwrites it with raw data.  I'm not
    sure if there's a bug in the header comments, in the driver source, or I
    misread something.
    
    The CDROM_LOCKDOOR ioctl seems to lock/unlock all doors on all drives,
    because it uses a global variable.

    [PATCH] Fix occasional stop_machine() lockup with > 2 CPUs
    
    Stephen Rothwell noted a case where one CPU was sitting in userspace, one
    in stop_machine() waiting for everyone to enter stopmachine().  This can
    happen if migration occurs at exactly the wrong time with more than 2 CPUS.
     Say we have 4 CPUS:
    
    1) stop_machine() on CPU 0creates stopmachine() threads for CPUS 1, 2
       and 3, and yields waiting for them to migrate to their CPUs and
       ack.
    
    2) stopmachine(2) gets rebalanced (probably on exec) to CPU 1.
    
    3) stopmachine(2) calls set_cpus_allowed on CPU 1, sleeps awaiting
       migration thread.
    
    4) stopmachine(1) calls set_cpus_allowed on CPU 0, moves onto CPU1 and
       starts spinning.
    
    Now the migration thread never runs, and we deadlock.  The simplest
    solution is for stopmachine() to yield until they are all in place.

    [PATCH] Fix an XFS direct I/O deadlock
    
    Here's a patch which fixes the deadlock Brad Fitzpatrick reported here:
    http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/14/98
    
    The meat of the problem is a locking order reversal between the XFS I/O
    lock and the inode semaphore (i_sem).  When we mix a number of threads
    doing both direct reads and writes, we hit an ABBA deadlock after a while
    because direct-io.c is taking and dropping i_sem after the XFS read path
    has already taken its I/O lock.  This is the wrong way around from XFS's
    point of view, in particular its the opposite order to the XFS write path.
    So this patch changes the logic for direct reads in the DIO_OWN_LOCKING
    case (i.e.  XFS-only case), but leaves things as is for the other two types
    of locking.
    
    Not real pretty, but fixes up the lock ordering and deadlock.
    
    Oh, I have tested direct reads and writes on ext3 and block devices as
    well, to ensure they still function correctly with the change (i.e.  they
    don't regress, should be a no-op there) which covers the other locking
    cases in __blockdev_direct_IO.

    [PATCH] cont_prepare_write() fix
    
    When cont_prepare_write() is padding out the "hole" with zeroed pages it
    doesn't increase i_size at the same time.  If writeback comes in during the
    execution of cont_prepare_write(), block_write_full_page() will think that
    these pages are outside i_size and will just clean the page without writing
    it.
    
    Fix that up by using generic_commit_write(), which will advance i_size for
    each page as it is dirtied.

    the description a tad more straightforward, but you be the judge. :)

    [PATCH] md: fix careless bug in raid10
    
    raid10 performs resync by reading all blocks, comparing to look for The
    requires re-tasking a bio that was used to read, so that it can be re-used
    for write.  So a number of fields need to be reset.
    
    The bi_bdev field was not being reset.  However when using on a partition
    of a device, it gets changed by generic_make_request.
    
    This patch simply resets bi_bdev to the correct value.

    [PATCH] Buffer overrun in arch/x86_64/sys_ia32.c:sys32_ni_syscall()
    
    With Chris Wright <chrisw@osdl.org>
    
    struct task_struct.comm is defined to be 16 chars, but
    arch/x86_64/sys_ia32.c:sys32_ni_syscall() and sys32_vm86_warning() copy it
    into a static 8 byte buffer, which will surely cause problems.  This patch
    makes lastcomm[] the right size, and makes sure it can't be overrun.  Since
    the code also goes to the effort of getting a local copy of current in "me",
    we may as well use it for printing the message.

Date:   Tue Nov 30 05:26:12 2004 -0800

    [UDP]: Select handling of bad checksums.
    
    Alternate workaround for blocking usage of select() by UDP applications.
    The problem is Linux optimizes the UDP receive checksum path so that checksum
    validation is not performed until the application read. This is a performance win
    but can cause applications that do select with blocking file descriptors to get false
    positives if the received message has a checksum error.
    There is a long running thread about this on LKML.
    
    This patch makes these applications work, but keeps the one-pass performance gain
    for those applications smart enough to use non-blocking file descriptors with
    select/poll. There is still a possibility to get a false positive if application does
    select on non-blocking fd then makes it blocking before doing the receive, but that
    is unlikely.
    
    Tested by injecting bad packets with SOCK_RAW.

    [NET]: Missing security_*() check in net/compat.c
    
    While looking at the SCM passing code in net/core/scm.c I noticed that there's
    a 32-bit compat implementation of scm_detach_fds()'s called
    scm_detach_fds_compat() living in net/compat.c.  While these two functions
    are mostly the same the latter does not include the call to the
    security_file_receive() hook which is almost certainly a bug.

    [IA64] Bigsur config: Add CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_ACPI so we can find serial devices
    
    In the absence of an HCDP, we used to assume there were legacy COM ports
    at 0x3f8 and 0x2f8, but I recently removed that assumption.
    
    "console=ttyS0" still works (assuming you have CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_ACPI
    turned on so you can find the ttyS0 device), but the console doesn't
    start working until the serial driver initializes.  If you need an
    early console and you know where it lives, something like
    "console=uart,io,0x3f8" will start working very early.

    [PATCH] Remove Futex Warning
    
    If we're waiting on a futex and we are woken up, it's either because
    someone did FUTEX_WAKE, we timed out, or have been signalled.  However, the
    WARN_ON(!signal_pending(current)) test is overzealous: with threads (a
    common use of futexes), we share the signal handler and the other
    thread might get to the signal before us.  In addition, exit_notify()
    can do a recalc_sigpending_tsk() on us, which will then clear our
    TIF_SIGPENDING bit, making signal_pending(current) return false.
    
    Returning EINTR is a little strange in this case, since this thread
    hasn't handled a signal.  However, with threads it's the best we can
    do: there's always a race where another thread could have been the
    actual one to handle the signal.

    [PATCH] x86_64: Fix lost edge triggered irqs on UP kernel
    
    Patch from Petr Vandrovec <vandrove@vc.cvut.cz>
    
    Recently I've observed problems with IDE disks while running UP kernel on
    x86-64 - it complained a lot about lost irq from hda/hdc.  I tracked
    problem down to the problem that at enable_irq() code calls
    hw_resend_irq(), but on x86-64 hw_resend_irq() does something useful only
    when CONFIG_SMP is defined, on UP systems it does nothing.
    
    Due to this IRQ is lost - and when IDE retries command, it can again happen
    that IRQ is delivered before IDE code does enable_irq(), and again and
    again, unless due to drive being lazy finally once kernel does enable_irq()
    before drive prepares its answer, and things move forward ...  to next lost
    IRQ.

    [PATCH] RLIMIT_MEMLOCK accounting of shmctl() SHM_LOCK is broken
    
    The accounting of shmctl() SHM_LOCK memory locks against the user
    structure is broken.  The check of the size of the to-be-locked region
    is based on the size of the segment as specified when it was created by
    shmget() (this size is *not* rounded up to a page boundary).
    
    Fix it by rounding the size properlt.  Also, tune up the spinlock
    coverage in there a little.

    [PATCH] PCI: Disable mmconfig on AMD CPUs.
    
    Disable mmconfig on AMD CPUs.
    
    This patch fixes various problems on PCI Express boards, like the
    Nforce4. They have a MCFG table in ACPI, but not all devices can be
    accessed using MMCONFIG.  e.g. the CPU builtin PCI devices in the A64
    Northbridge can't.  Linux happily uses mmconfig for all PCI devices and
    that cause failures and memory corruption.
    
    Right solution apparently is to get more information from MCFG which is
    supposed to tell for which busses mmconfig is legal and for which ones
    not. But that would be a much more complicated patch and I don't have
    a specification of this enhanced table.
    
    This patch just disable MMCONFIG on all AMD CPUs. This is a kludge,
    but works around the problem for now.
    
    Patch for both i386 and x86-64

    There was some indecision on whether it's more useful to report

    you are right. The incrementation is wrong, but it doesn't have any
    negative effect. However the same applies for the usb_hotplug() function

    [ARM PATCH] 2259/1: Rip out ixp2000 IRQ_ERR_STATUS demultiplexing
    
    Patch from Lennert Buytenhek
    
    There are thirteen different IRQs chained off IRQ_ERR_STATUS, one for
    each possible error class that the IXP can signal an interrupt for, but
    there are no in-tree users of these interrupts, and it doesn't make much
    sense to treat them as separate interrupts if we can just have one
    handler checking each of the thirteen errors in one go instead.
    
    Besides that, the error interrupt handling can't even have been working
    properly in the first place as the chained handler was testing the wrong
    bits in the IRQ_ERR_STATUS register.
    
    So this patch rips it all out.

    [PATCH] floppy boot-time detection fix
    
    When the FDC hardware is initialized, it sometimes generates a floppy
    interrupt right away - without being told to.  This interrupt can hit
    the detection code that executes right after the initialization code, in
    particular it can get intermixed with user_reset_fdc() that the
    detection code uses.  The fd driver is fundamentally single-threaded
    when it comes to handling events: an unexpected irq that arrives in the
    wrong moment can confuse the reset_fdc() code, which, with softirq and
    hardirq threading on, executes in keventd.
    
    In the stock kernel this stale irq doesnt seem to hit the detection code
    in the wrong moment, but i think under certain circumstances it may
    still happen.  One of the typical incarnations of the race was the
    following message:
    
     reset set in interrupt, calling c0258400
    
    and googling for "reset set in interrupt, calling" does turn up a fair
    number of bootlogs (most of them 2.4 ones) that show such a detection
    failure, so i think upstream wants to have the fix too.
    
    the fix is simple: delay a bit after initialization, to make sure the
    stale irq does not interfere with the detection code. It will be safely
    ignored, since do_floppy is still NULL. It might look sloppy that i went
    for a delay, but delay i think it is better than waiting for the irq to
    occur, because i dont think there's a guarantee that fdc initialization
    triggers an interrupt, so waiting for it could hang the boot process. A
    delay OTOH is totally harmless.
    
    The attached patch implements this fix, which resolves the detection
    problem on my testbox.
    
    here's again how a failure looks like:
    
     Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
     reset set in interrupt, calling c0258400
     floppy0: no floppy controllers found
    
    and this is how it works with the fix:
    
     Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
     FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077

    [PATCH] ppc64: fix hang on legacy iSeries
    
    Recently we have uncovered a bug in the kernel exception exit path
    which can cause iSeries machines to hang with interrupts disabled,
    typically when unloading a module.  This patch fixes the bug and
    should go in 2.6.10.  Here is the detailed explanation:
    
    There are a couple of places in the exception exit path in entry.S
    where we disable interrupts and then later reenable them.  We
    hard-disable interrupts even on legacy iSeries (rather than
    soft-disabling them) because the final part of the exception exit path
    needs interrupts hard-disabled (even on legacy iSeries), because
    otherwise an incoming interrupt could trash SRR0 and SRR1 and cause us
    to lose state.
    
    The intention was that each path that hard-disabled interrupts would
    hard-enable them again, either explicitly or by executing an rfid
    instruction (return from interrupt, doubleword).  However there was
    one path where we didn't correctly hard-enable interrupts.  This meant
    we could end up calling schedule() with interrupts hard-disabled and
    then switch to the stopmachine thread (used in removing a module),
    which spins polling a variable until another cpu changes it.  Since
    local_irq_enable() etc. on legacy iSeries only soft-enable interrupts,
    we got into the stopmachine thread with interrupts hard-disabled, and
    the machine hung at that point.
    
    This patch fixes it by making sure that when we go to re-enable
    interrupts, the MSR value we are loading up actually does have the
    MSR.EE (external interrupt enable) bit set.  Stephen Rothwell has
    verified that this actually does fix the bug on iSeries.  The bug
    also potentially exists on pSeries (and this patch fixes it), but
    there it doesn't really matter, because schedule() will enable
    interrupts (and on pSeries that means hard-enabling them), and because
    the hypervisor doesn't mind you having interrupts hard-disabled for
    extended periods on pSeries.  Note that all these comments about
    pSeries also apply to POWER5 iSeries (i5) machines.
    
    While I was there I noticed that we were jumping to ret_from_except
    after calling do_IRQ on iSeries, rather than ret_from_except_lite,
    meaning that we will restore registers 14-31 twice, unnecessarily.  I
    changed it to jump to ret_from_except_lite instead, and Stephen
    checked that this change doesn't cause any breakage.

    [PATCH] ia64/x86_64/s390 overlapping vma fix
    
    IA64 is also vulnerable to the huge-vma-in-executable bug in 64 bit elf
    support, it just insert a vma of zero page without checking overlap, so user
    can construct a elf with section begin from 0x0 to trigger this BUGON().
    
    However, I think it's safe to check overlap before we actually insert a vma
    into vma list.  And I also feel check vma overlap everywhere is unnecessary,
    because invert_vm_struct will check it again, so the check is duplicated.
    It's better to have invert_vm_struct return a value then let caller check if
    it successes.  Here is a patch against 2.6.10.rc2-mm3 I have tested it on
    i386, x86_64 and ia64 machines.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Make early processor spinup based on physical ids
    
    This changes the early CPU spinup code to be based on physical CPU ID
    instead of logical.  This will make it possible to kexec off of a
    different cpu than 0, for example after it's been hot-unplugged.
    
    The booted cpu will still be mapped as logical cpu 0, since there's various
    stuff in the early boot that assumes logical boot cpuid is 0.
    
    Also, it expands the kexec boot param structure to allow the booted physical
    cpuid to be passed in.  This includes bumping the version number to 2 for
    backwards compat.

    [PATCH] USB: add ati_remote.c device id
    
    please consider applying the attached patch which adds an identifier for
    another variant of the X10 RF remote. This one is very common everywhere
    in Europe where Aldi (a supermarket discounter) sells their PCs
    (Netherlands, Belgium, northern Germany, France, Spain, ...).
    Considering that they ship a few 100,000 PCs once or twice every year
    you can imagine there are quite a few of these remotes kicking around.
    
    I've tested with 2.6.10-rc2 and various versions of XMMS and lirc with
    the devinput driver. It does play well with lirc-0.7.0-pre8 but not so
    nice with 0.7.0. I don't know why, but according to some posts on the
    lirc list it seems to be in lirc.
    
    By the way, there seem to be even more variants of this device,
    according to:

    [PATCH] USB: usb_sg_*() unlink deadlock fix
    
    This would be rare with HCDs that maintain chains of DMA
    transfers, except if the HC dies in the middle of an I/O
    request; so no rush to merge this.  It'd happen in a PIO
    based HCD though ... :)
    
    
    Async unlink of an URB from an endpoint's I/O queue _normally_ involves a
    delay from handshaking with the host controller, to be sure the DMA queue
    is inactive.  So urb->complete() runs after usb_unlink_urb() returns, and
    from a different context.  But not always...
    
    The completion may run immediately whenever the HCD knows that HC isn't
    busy with the URB.  Maybe that HCD is in a HALT state, or the endpoint
    queue is is temporarily off-schedule (halted, or dead after PM resume
    from D3cold, etc) ... or maybe the HCD doesn't use DMA, so most unlinks
    just list_del_init() and return.
    
    This makes usb_sg_cancel() and sg_complete() drop the io->lock when they
    cancel active urbs, preventing potential self-deadlock when that completion
    handler runs immediately.

    [PATCH] USB: fix Genesys GL880S EHCI
    
    This has two minor patches to make this driver work better with
    the Genesys GL880S:  don't report hardware port indicators (until
    the root hub code supports them); and patch the misreported number
    of ports (two, not four).

    [PATCH] USB Gadget: add and use gadget_is_pxa27x()
    
    The UDC in Intel's "Bulverde" processors is incompatible with the
    one in their PXA 25x/26x/21x processors, and has different sorts
    of restrictions.  For example, it can implement real CDC Ethernet,
    while the earlier (PXA 25x etc) can't.
    
    
    This adds a gadget_is_pxa27x() function and uses it appropriately in the
    current set of gadget drivers.  (And moves an LH7A40X entry to the right
    place in "ether.c").

    [PATCH] I2C: add adm1026 chip driver
    
    Here is the revised adm1026 driver port for kernel 2.6.10-rc2.  It takes into
    account Jean Delvare's and Mark Hoffman's comments and recommendations, and
    provides pretty much the entire feature set of the 2.4.X kernel driver, but
    in (hopefully) a manner compliant with the standards for the 2.6.X kernel
    lm_sensors drivers.
    
    As discussed in previous messages, control over the pwm output is provided
    via:
    
    pwm[1-3]                  {0-255}
    pwm[1-3]_enable           {0-2}  (off, manual, automatic fan control)
    
    Note that there is really only one pwm register and one enable bit.  pwm[2-3]
    and pwm[2-3]_enable are provided for the sake of a chip-indpendent interface,
    and are simply RW mirrors of pwm1 and pwm1_enable, respectively.
    
    Access to the DAC is provided via:
    
    analog_out            {0-2500} (millivolts)
    
    No way is currently provided to turn on DAC-mediated automatic fan control.
    See my previous email in this thread for the reasons why.
    
    Control over automatic fan "on" temperatures are provided by:
    
    temp[1-3]_auto_point1_temp     {-128000 - 127000}
    
    Hardware-determined hysteresis and range values are revealed in:
    
    temp[1-3]_auto_point1_temp_hyst   {temp[1-3]_auto_point1_temp - 6000}
    temp[1-3]_auto_point2_temp        {temp[1-3]_auto_point1_temp + 20000}
    
    Failsafe critical temperatures at which the fans go to maximum speed are
    controled via:
    
    temp[1-3]_crit_enable       {0-1}                 (off, on)
    temp[1-3]_crit              {-128000 - 127000}
    
    Again, there is really only one "enable critical-temperature-fan-maximization"
    bit.  temp[2-3]_crit_enable are simply RW mirrors of temp1_crit_enable
    
    These values override any values set for the pwm-mediated automatic fan
    control.
    
    VRM is now set via Rudolf Marek's functions.  VID is read from the assumed
    correct set of pins (GPIO11-GPIO15), and no longer a user-writable field.
    
    In keeping with Greg KH's changes,
    
    normal_i2c_range
    normal_isa_range
    
    have been removed,
    
    and
    
    normal_i2c
    
    has been updated to enumerate all addresses.  (Just adding 0x2d)
    
    Finally, the val-comparison-before-assignment bug has been corrected.

    [PATCH] e100: early reset fix
    
    Gents, what do we think of the below fix?
    
    Thanks.
    
    My IBM A21P laptop is getting an IRQ storm at boot.
    
    IRQ #11 is shared between USB and e100, and USB is getting in there first.
    Consequently, when e100 initialises the hardware, that interrupt line is ready
    to go.  As soon as e100.c runs pci_set_master(), the interrupt hits the CPU.
    But of course the e100 driver isn't ready to handle the interrupt yet, so the
    system disables IRQ #11.
    
    This only happens on warm boots (/sbin/reboot).  Things work OK from power-on.
     So I assume that the BIOS is failing to fully reset the NIC and that some
    sort of interrupt is internally pending.
    
    The patch rearranges e100_probe() so that we issue e100_hw_reset() prior to
    running pci_set_master(), and fixes the problem.
    
    Note that e100_probe() is now running e100_hw_reset() twice - I didn't remove
    the later call for general paranoia reasons.
    
    eepro100.c has the same lockup, and needs a similar fix.

    Len Brown convinced me that the problem with disabling

    fact that ELCR needs to be updated when removing the PCI
    routing. So this reverts the previous cset and updates
    ELCR as suggested by Len.

    Ignore offline CPUs when registering IOSAPIC interrupts.  We previously
    directed interrupts even to offline CPUs, which means that if you have some
    unused CPUs (e.g., you used "maxcpus="), some interrupts won't work.
    
    This really hurts because distro installs typically use "maxcpus=1".

    acpi: don't disable PCI irq links that were active at boot.
    
    This fixes at least some interrupt polarity setup cases.
    The ACPI guys may want to eventually do this differently, but
    in the meantime this makes ACPI behaviour closer to non-ACPI
    behaviour, and fixes known problems.
    
    I'll further argue that this protects non-PCI devices that may
    just share the irq routing from being screwed, but that may or
    may not be an argument that everybody buys into.

    [PATCH] del_timer() vs. mod_timer() SMP race
    
    We just spent some days fighting a rare race in one of the distro's who backported
    some of timer.c from 2.6 to 2.4 (though they missed a bit).
    
    The actual race we found didn't happen in 2.6 _but_ code inspection showed that a
    similar race is still present in 2.6, explanation below:
    
    Code removing a timer from a list (run_timers or del_timer) takes that CPU list
    lock, does list_del, then timer->base = NULL.
    
    It is mandatory that this timer->base = NULL is visible to other CPUs only after
    the list_del() is complete. If not, then mod timer could see it NULL, thus take it's
    own CPU list lock and not the one for the CPU the timer was beeing removed from the
    list, and thus the list_add in mod_timer() could race with the list_del() from
    run_timers() or del_timer().
    
    Our race happened with run_timers(), which _DOES_ contain a proper smp_wmb() in the
    right spot in 2.6, but didn't in the "backport" we were fighting with.
    
    However, del_timer() doesn't have such a barrier, and thus is subject to this race in
    2.6 as well. This patch fixes it.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix typo when parsing isa "reg" properties
    
    This patch fixes a typo in the code that parse Open Firmware properties
    for devices under an "isa" node, the incorrect struct size was used when
    parsing the "reg" property of these.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix default command line
    
    The ppc64 kernel can be built with a default command line (CONFIG_CMDLINE)
    for cases where none is provided by the firmware.
    
    However, some OF implementation always pass a "bootargs" property that only
    contains the "0" terminating byte of a C string which caused us to think
    there was a command line, and not use the built-in one. This patch fixes it.

    this patch against 2.6.10-rc2 finally detects rivafb on NV30 based power
    books by adding the pciid. Wolfram Quester tested it and reported it
    working. It also cleans up the error code reported from the probe

    [PATCH] fix for breakage introduced in hgafb.c
    
    ChangeSet "adaplas: [PATCH] fbdev: Add __iomem annotations to hgafb" had
    actually broken it - it not only added a (useless) cast in rowaddr(), it
    had also added a dereferencing.
    
    Since it is video memory and since we do memory transfers on the
    resulting "address"...  IOW, it's even exploitable - not that there had
    been a lot of HGA boxen out there, but...
    
    This restores the intended behaviour.

    [PATCH] compat_sys_fcntl[64] contain superfluous, buggy test
    
    here is a fix to a previous ChangeSet from John; 32-bit emulation of flock(fd,
    F_GETLK, &lock) currently is broken.
    
    The ChangeSet:
    http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/cset%404152257aJKu1UClRcfvhsK6IjGYSeQ?nav=index.html|ChangeSet@-12w
    from John Engel <jhe@us.ibm.com> fixes an off-by-one error and according
    to the ChangeSet comment, it also contains a fix to handle l_len < 0 which
    is now defined in POSIX 1003.1-2001 from the fcntl man page.
    
    Gordon Jin <gordon.jin@intel.com> reports that the added test causes
    compat_sys_fcntl[64] to fail: If fcntl(fd, F_GETLK, &lock) finds no
    conflicting lock it sets l_whence to F_UNLCK, leaves all the other fields
    unchanged, and returns 0.  The (f.l_start < 0) test wrongly converts this
    to an EINVAL result.
    
    The underlying sys_fcntl function which compat_sys_fcntl and
    compat_sys_fcntl64 invoke already handles POSIX behavior correctly.  The
    additional tests in the compat wrappers are not needed.
    
    Here is a test case; its expected result is:
    
    PASS

    [PATCH] (1/4) eicon iomem annotations and fixes
    
     * adds new helpers ({GET,PUT}_{WORD,DWORD}) parallel to READ_WORD
       et.al., but used on normal memory instead of iomem.  Instances of
       READ_WORD and friends that are applied to vmalloc'ed memory and local
       variables switched to new helpers.

    [PATCH] smbfs: Bug #3758 - Broken symlinks on smbfs
    
    The patches attached here fixes the BUG #3758 - "Broken symlinks on smbfs
    with 2.6.10-rc[12]".  There are two patches, one to be applied over version
    2.6.9 and the other over 2.6.10-rc2.
    
    The old utilities (and the old driver) uses uid=0, gid=0, dmask=0 and
    fmask=0 to flag the lack of this parameters on the mount command line.
    When the user do not specify the uid, gid, fmask or dmask, the current
    driver will assign gid=root, gid=root, dmask=755, fmask=755.  This behavior
    is similar to the old 2.x samba versions.
    
    To make the driver see the permissions and ownership assigned on the
    server, "smbmount" and "smbmnt" utilities must be patched.  The patches is
    already available on the attached patches at Bug #3330 or Samba Bug #999.

    Problem identified by Jan Kasprzak.
    
    Limit on domainname_max (currently 50) is too small.
    
    Just use the beginning of input buffer as scratch space for it, and save a
    little stack space while we're at it.

    Looking at  get_task_comm patch:
    http://linus.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/patch@1.1803.144.3
    
    There is one other place where task->comm is accessed outside current.
    There are two issues.  The code is trying to copy to temp space without
    task_lock.  It is not using temp space for actual user copy.

    [PATCH] sonypi: return an error from sonypi_camera_command() if the camera isn't enabled
    
    The sonypi_camera_command() used to fail without returning an error code if
    the user fergot to enable the camera in the sonypi module (using the
    camera=1 module parameter).  This caused the meye driver to apparently load
    correctly but miserably fail later, when trying to access the camera for
    getting some data out of it.
    
    This patch adds an error code to sonypi_camera_command() and makes the meye
    driver check for it in the PCI probe routine.  If the function fails, a
    message is printed in the kernel logs reminding the user it should better
    RTFM.
    
    The patch also removes some sonypi_camera_command() commands (those
    supposed to return the current camera settings) which are unreliable.  The
    meye driver does not use them anyway.

    [PATCH] m32r: Fix a boot hang of UP kernel
    
    This patch fixes a hanging up at boot time of 2.6.10-rc2 m32r UP kernel.
    It was due to a lack of update_process_times() in time.c.
    
    Such a boot hang was caused only in UP systems, because
    update_process_times() had been executed correctly in
    smp_local_timer_interrupt() of arch/m32r/kernel/smp.c for SMP.
    
    arch/m32r/kernel/time.c:
    
    - UP: Fix do_timer_interrupt() to use update_process_times().
    - UP: Move profile_tick() into do_timer_interrupt().
    - Change __inline__ to inline.

    [PATCH] mlock-vs-VM_IO hang fix
    
    With Andrea Arcangeli <andrea@novell.com>
    
    Fix a hang which occurs when mlock() encounters a mapping of /dev/mem.
    These have VM_IO set.  follow_page() keeps returning zero (not a valid pfn)
    and handle_mm_fault() keeps on returning VM_FAULT_MINOR (there's a pte
    there), so get_user_pages() locks up.
    
    The patch changes get_user_pages() to just bale out when it hits a VM_IO
    region.  make_pages_present() is taught to ignore the resulting -EFAULT.
    
    We still have two bugs:
    
    a) If a process has a VM_IO vma, get_user_pages() will bale early,
       without having considered the vmas at higher virtual addresses.
    
       As do_mlock() also walks the vma list this bug is fairly benign, but
       get_user_pages() is doing the wrong thing there.
    
    b) The `len' argument to get_user_pages should be long, not int.  We
       presently have a 16TB limit on 64-bit.

    [PATCH] md: Fix problem with unsigned variable going "negative" in linear.c
    
    We replace 'size' by 'start'.  'start' means exactly the same as
    'curr_offset - size', and the equivalence of the new code can be tested
    based on this.  The difference is that 'start' will never be negative and
    so can fit in a 'sector_t' while 'size' could be negative.
    
    Also make curr_offset sector_t, as it should have been.

    [PATCH] vmscan: ignore swap token when in trouble
    
    The token-based thrashing control patches introduced a problem: when a task
    which doesn't hold the token tries to run direct-reclaim, that task is told
    that pages which belong to the token-holding mm are referenced, even though
    they are not.  This means that it is possible for a huge number of a
    non-token-holding mm's pages to be scanned to no effect.  Eventually, we give
    up and go and oom-kill something.
    
    So the patch arranges for the thrashing control logic to be defeated if the
    caller has reached the highest level of scanning priority.

    [PATCH] move HCDP/PCDP to early uart console
    
    This changes the HCDP/PCDP support to use the early uart console
    rather than using early_serial_setup().
    
    As a consequence, ia64 serial device names will now stay constant
    regardless of firmware console settings.  (A serial device selected as
    an EFI console device on HP ia64 boxes used to automatically become
    ttyS0.)
    
    This also removes the ia64 early-boot kludge of assuming legacy COM
    ports at 0x3f8 and 0x2f8.  For boxes that have legacy ports but no
    HCDP, "console=ttyS0" will still work, but the console won't start
    working until after the serial driver initializes and discovers the
    devices.
    
    WARNING:
    
    If you have an HP machine and you're using the MP serial console port
    (the connector labelled "console" on the 3-headed cable), this patch
    will break your console!
    
    HOW TO FIX IT:
    
     1) The console device will change from /dev/ttyS0 to /dev/ttyS1,
        ttyS2, or ttyS3, so:
    
        1a) Edit /etc/inittab to add a getty entry for
               /dev/ttyS1 (rx4640, rx5670, rx7620, rx8620, Superdome),
               /dev/ttyS2 (rx1600), or
               /dev/ttyS3 (rx2600).
    
        1b) Edit /etc/securetty to add ttyS1, ttyS2, or ttyS3.
    
        1c) Leave the existing ttyS0 entries in /etc/inittab and
            /etc/securetty so you can still boot old kernels.
    
     2) Edit /etc/elilo.conf to remove any "console=" arguments (see [1]).
    
     3) Run elilo to install the bootloader with new configuration.
    
     4) Reboot and use the EFI boot option maintenance menu to select
        exactly one device for console output, input, and standard error.
        Then do a cold reset so the changes take effect.
    
        For the MP console, be careful to select the device with
        "Acpi(HWP0002,700)/Pci(...)/Uart" in the path (see [2]).
    
    DETAILS:
    
      - Prior to this patch, serial device names depended on the HCDP,
        which in turn depends on EFI console settings.  After this patch,
        the naming always stays the same, regardless of firmware settings.
    
        For example, an rx1600 with a single built-in serial port plus
        an MP has these ports:
                                       Old             Old
                      MMIO         (EFI console    (EFI console
                     address        on builtin)     on MP port)      New
                    ==========      ==========      ==========     ======
        builtin     0xff5e0000        ttyS0           ttyS1         ttyS0
        MP UPS      0xf8031000        ttyS1           ttyS2         ttyS1
        MP Console  0xf8030000        ttyS2           ttyS0         ttyS2
        MP 2        0xf8030010        ttyS3           ttyS3         ttyS3
        MP 3        0xf8030038        ttyS4           ttyS4         ttyS4
    
      - If you want to have multiple devices in the EFI console path, you
        can, but Linux won't be able to deduce which console to use, so it
        will default to using VGA.  You can use "console=hcdp" (the UART
        device from the EFI path) or "console=ttyS<n>" to select the
        device directly.
    
    TROUBLESHOOTING:
    
      - No kernel output after "Uncompressing Linux... done":
    
            -> You're using an MP port as the console and specified
               "console=ttyS0".  This port is now named something else.
               Remove the "console=" option.
    
            -> Multiple UARTs selected as EFI console devices, and you're
               looking at the wrong one.  Make sure only one UART is
               selected (use the EFI Boot Manager "Boot option maintenance"
               menu).
    
            -> You're physically connected to the MP port but have a
               non-MP UART selected as EFI console device.  Either move
               the console cable to the non-MP UART, or change the EFI
               console path to the MP UART (the MP UART is the one with
               "Acpi(HWP0002,700)/Pci(...)/Uart" in it.)
    
      - Long pause (60+ seconds) between "Uncompressing Linux... done"
        and start of kernel output:
    
            -> No early console, probably because you used "console=ttyS<n>".
               Remove the "console=" option.
    
      - Kernel and init script output works fine, but no "login:" prompt:
    
            -> Add getty entry to /etc/inittab for console tty.  Use the table
               in (1a) above or look for the "Adding console on ttyS<n>" message
               that tells you which device is the console.
    
      - "login:" prompt, but can't login as root:
    
            -> Add entry to /etc/securetty for console tty.
    
    [1] When the EFI console path contains exactly one device (either
        serial or VGA), 2.6.6 and newer kernels default to that device
        automatically.  So if you remove "console=" arguments, you can use
        the same elilo configuration to boot any 2.6.6 or newer kernel
        with or without this patch.
    
        If you need to boot kernels older than 2.6.6 (including RHEL3 and
        SLES9), keep an 'append="console=ttyS0"' line in those elilo.conf
        stanzas.
    
        Non-HP machines will still need "console=" for serial consoles
        because they don't supply the HCDP table.
    
    [2] The HP management card (MP) causes confusion because it is always
        active as an EFI console, even if it doesn't appear in the EFI
        console path.  If your console path is set to a non-MP UART, and
        you happen to be attached to the MP UART, everything works in EFI,
        but the kernel will think the non-MP UART is the console, so you
        won't see any kernel output.

    [PATCH] early uart console support
    
    This adds an early polled-mode "uart" console driver, based on Andi Kleen's
    early_printk work.
    
    The difference is that this locates the UART device directly by its MMIO or
    I/O port address, so we don't have to make assumptions about how ttyS
    devices will be named.  After the normal serial driver starts, we try to
    locate the matching ttyS device and start a console there.
    
    Sample usage:
        console=uart,io,0x3f8
        console=uart,mmio,0xff5e0000,115200n8
    
    If the baud rate isn't specified, we peek at the UART to figure it out.

    [PATCH] fix for mpol mm corruption on tmpfs
    
    With the inline symlink shmem_inode_info structure is overwritten with data
    until vfs_inode, and that caused the ->policy to be a corrupted pointer
    during unlink.  It wasn't immediatly easy to see what was going on due the
    random mm corruption that generated a weird oops, it looked more like a
    race condition on freed memory at first.
    
    There's simply no need to set a policy for inodes, since the idx is always
    zero.  All we have to do is to initialize the data structure (the semaphore
    may need to run during the page allocation for the non-inline symlink) but
    we don't need to allocate the rb nodes.  This way we don't need to call
    mpol_free during the destroy_inode (not doable at all if the policy rbtree
    is corrupt by the inline symlink ;).
    
    An equivalent version of this patch based on a 2.6.5 tree with additional
    numa features on top of this (i.e.  interleaved by default, and that's
    prompted me to add a comment in the LNK init path), works fine in a numa
    simulation on my laptop (untested on the bare hardware).

    [PATCH] sched: fix ->nr_uninterruptible handling bugs
    
    PREEMPT_RT on SMP systems triggered weird (very high) load average
    values rather easily, which turned out to be a mainline kernel
    ->nr_uninterruptible handling bug in try_to_wake_up().
    
    the following code:
    
            if (old_state == TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE) {
                    old_rq->nr_uninterruptible--;
    
    potentially executes with old_rq potentially being != rq, and hence
    updating ->nr_uninterruptible without the lock held. Given a
    sufficiently concurrent preemption workload the count can get out of
    whack and updates might get lost, permanently skewing the global count.
    Nothing except the load-average uses nr_uninterruptible() so this
    condition can go unnoticed quite easily.
    
    the fix is to update ->nr_uninterruptible always on the runqueue where
    the task currently is. (this is also a tiny performance plus for
    try_to_wake_up() as a stackslot gets freed up.)
    
    while fixing this bug i found three other ->nr_uninterruptible related
    bugs:
    
     - the update should be moved from deactivate_task() into schedule(),
       beacause e.g. setscheduler() does deactivate_task()+activate_task(),
       which in turn may result in a -1 counter-skew if setscheduler() is
       done on a task asynchronously, which task is still on the runqueue
       but has already set ->state to TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE.
    
       sys_sched_setscheduler() is used rarely, but the bug is real. (The
       fix is also a small performance enhancement.)
    
       The rules for ->nr_uninterruptible updating are the following: it
       gets increased by schedule() only, when a task is moved off the
       runqueue and it has a state of TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE. It is decreased
       by try_to_wake_up(), by the first wakeup that materially changes the
       state from TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE back to TASK_RUNNING, and moves the
       task to the runqueue.
    
     - on CPU-hotplug down we might zap a CPU that has a nonzero counter.
       Due to the fuzzy nature of the global counter a CPU might hold a
       nonzero ->nr_uninterruptible count even if it has no tasks anymore.
       The solution is to 'migrate' the counter to another runqueue.
    
     - we should not return negative counter values from the
       nr_uninterruptible() function, since it accesses them without taking
       the runqueue locks, so the total sum might be slightly above or
       slightly below the real count.
    
    I tested the attached patch on x86 SMP and it solves the load-average
    problem. (I have tested CPU_HOTPLUG compilation but not functionality.)
    I think this is a must-have for 2.6.10, because there are apps that go
    berzerk if load-average is too high (e.g. sendmail).

    [PATCH] selinux: cache not freed if load_policy fails; reload BUG's
    
    If security_load_policy() fails on the first try, the cache is never cleaned
    up. When the policy is fixed and a reload is attempted, the old cache will
    still exist, causing a BUG() in kmem_cache_create().
    
    This patch adds a destroy operation to clean up the cache on failure.

    [PATCH] PCI Hotplug: clean up rpaphp_pci.c::rpaphp_find_pci_dev
    
    this patch improves rpaphp_find_pci_dev. First it uses the for_each_pci_dev
    macro instead of the while loop, making this hotplug safe (which is a good
    idea in a hotplug driver, isn't it?). Then it removes retval_dev. retval_dev
    is set to the found device when something is found, NULL otherwise. If
    nothing is found dev will be NULL at the end of the loop anyway and the
    found device if we found something, no need for retval_dev then. And a very
    small coding style fix.

    [PATCH] USB Storage: Remove unnecessary state testing
    
    This patch started as as405 from Alan Stern.  It has been re-generated
    against the current tip of the BK tree.
    
    For quite a while we've had a bunch of state-transition testing code in the
    driver, to report if anything bad ever happens (like the SCSI midlayer
    trying to queue a second command before the first one finishes).  None of
    those tests triggered in a very long time; this aspect of the code appears
    to be extremely stable.
    
    So this patch removes all those tests for illegal values of us->sm_state.
    It turns out that sm_state was used only for one other purpose: to check
    whether a command had timed out and caused a SCSI abort.  That piece of
    information can easily be stored in a single new bitflag (which is called
    calling US_FLIDX_TIMED_OUT) and doing so makes us->sm_state completely
    unused.  Hence the patch removes it from the structure.

    [PATCH] USB Storage: Force INQUIRY length to be 36
    
    This is patch as399, originally from Alan Stern.
    
    A recent change to the scsi_probe_lun() routine now allows host drivers to
    specify a device's INQUIRY length in a way that cannot be overridden by
    the value returned from the device.  This patch makes usb-storage set the
    length to 36; now buggy devices won't be able to cause trouble by saying
    that they have 37 bytes of INQUIRY data available.
    
    The only way this value could be changed is if someone creates a SCSI
    blacklist entry with the BLIST_INQUIRY_58 flag -- and no one would do that
    for a USB device (I hope)!

    [PATCH] USB Storage: fixes to usb-storage scanning thread
    
    This was originally patch as401 from Alan Stern.  This patch makes a couple
    of small changes to the new scanning thread.
    
    It changes the name to "usb-stor-scan", which was my original intention and
    makes more sense than the current name.
    
    It also removes the PF_NOFREEZE flag; if someone suspends their system
    immediately after plugging in a USB storage device then the scanning thread
    should be frozen along with everything else.  The delay will be restarted
    after the system wakes up.

    [PATCH] Re: The "ipaq" module: Updated list of vendor/product IDs
    
    This patch for ipaq.h and ipaq.c in drivers/usb/serial/ has the
    following features:
    
    o Provides an updated table with all vendor/product IDs (except one [1])
    present in Microsoft ActiveSync 3.7.1, the latest version available for
    download.
    
    o Removes #defines with vendor and product IDs from ipaq.h [2]
    
    The table has been autogenerated from the file wceusbsh.inf (extracted
    from MSASYNC.EXE with cabextract). The scripts used to generate the
    table become available for download as part of the SynCE project
    (http://synce.sourceforge.net).
    
    [1] Vendor 0x45e (Microsoft) with device 0xCE is not included, because
    they are used when the device is turned off but still connected to the
    PC via USB. When the device is turned on, it changes vendor/product IDs
    to the more specific ones.
    
    [2] Not needed with an autogenerated device table

    by random data before the in-kernel driver resets the devices.
    This patch adds a blurb to the ARM Bootloader documentation
    reminding developers to quiesce all DMA capable devices before
    executing the kernel.

    The current timer interrupt implementation can cause time to skip

    [IA64] perfmon: enable interrupts around semaphore call
    
    fix a problem in pfm_handle_work() where a task may
    go to sleep in down_interruptible() with interrupts
    disabled. This may happen only for a monitored thread
    for which the PFM_FL_NOTIFY_BLOCK flag is set. The fix
    re-enables interrupts around the semaphore call. It is safe
    to do so because pfm_handle_work() is called from
    do_notify_user() which is called only when the task is about
    to leave the kernel, i.e., no risk of stack overflow because
    of interrupt nesting.

    We should probably also make floppy use the irq probing
    mechanism, which handles that situation more gracefully.

    [PATCH] Make dss1_divert ISDN module work on SMP again
    
    When I switched my installation from kernel 2.4 to 2.6 I recognized that
    the ISDN module dss1_divert was marked incompilable (config option
    CONFIG_CLEAN_COMPILE must be turned off).
    
    The compile problem was the obsolete using of kernel 2.4 critical
    sections.  I replaced the cli() stuff with spinlocks as explained in the
    Documentation/spinlocks.txt file.  After that the module compiles and
    runs as expected.

    [PATCH] Lock initializer unifying Batch 2 (SCSI)
    
    To make spinlock/rwlock initialization consistent all over the kernel,
    this patch converts explicit lock-initializers into spin_lock_init() and
    rwlock_init() calls.
    
    Currently, spinlocks and rwlocks are initialized in two different ways:
    
      lock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED
      spin_lock_init(&lock)
    
      rwlock = RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED
      rwlock_init(&rwlock)
    
    this patch converts all explicit lock initializations to
    spin_lock_init() or rwlock_init(). (Besides consistency this also helps
    automatic lock validators and debugging code.)
    
    The conversion was done with a script, it was verified manually and it
    was reviewed, compiled and tested as far as possible on x86, ARM, PPC.
    
    There is no runtime overhead or actual code change resulting out of this
    patch, because spin_lock_init() and rwlock_init() are macros and are
    thus equivalent to the explicit initialization method.
    
    That's the second batch of the unifying patches.

    [PATCH] SCSI dc395x.c: Fix type for irq and io ports
    
    Store the port and irq in unsigned long and unsigned int's instead of
    as u16's and u8's. The later was fine on x86 but not on sparc64.

    [PATCH] SCSI dc395x.c: store pci device pointer
    
    Store the PCI device pointer into the adapter control block. This is
    used in the pci_map_*/pci_unmap_* calls and previously it would have
    been set to NULL. This appears to be no problem for x86 but is a
    problem for sparc64.

    [PATCH] sd.c: adjust READ_CAPACITY for broken devices
    
    A number of USB mass storage devices return the wrong value in response to
    READ CAPACITY: They give the total number of blocks rather than the
    highest block number.  Currently the usb-storage driver tries to adjust
    for this by altering the contents of the reply buffer.  That's not a very
    good idea because it prevents users from seeing what the device actually
    has to say; it violates the principle that a transport should do nothing
    more than transfer data.
    
    This patch moves the responsibility for adjusting the capacity to the sd
    driver instead, by adding a new device flag.  After this has been merged
    the corresponding change (to set the flag) will be made to the usb-storage
    driver.

    The patch at the end of this message should fix this (passes basic tests).
    Someone added the ioctl to reset the SCSI device but the error handling
    is not quite correct. The code in 2.6.10-rc1 allows st_ioctl to continue
    unless reset succeeded. The fix allows continuation only if
    scsi_nonblockable_ioctl() does not handle the ioctl (returns -ENODEV).
    retval is cleared because the following code assumes it is zero unless set
    to something else.

    Correct, SCSI_QLOGIC_1280_1040 should depend on SCSI_QLOGIC_1280.
    
    The patch below does this.

    [PATCH] sg: Fix oops of sg_cmd_done and sg_release race
    
    The following patch fixes a race condition in sg of sg_cmd_done racing
    with sg_release. I've seen this bug hit several times on test machines
    and the following patch fixes it. The race is that if srp->done is set
    and the waiting thread gets a spurious wakeup immediately afterwards,
    then the waiting thread can end up executing and completing, then getting
    closed, freeing sfp before the wake_up_interruptible is called, which
    then will result in an oops. The oops is fixed by locking around the
    setting srp->done to 1 and the wake_up, and also locking around the
    checking of srp->done, which guarantees that the wake_up_interruptible
    will always occur before the sleeping thread gets a chance to run.

    nmi_count() is a stub only used once in arch/ia64/kernel/irq.c, so we
    can use 0 directly there.  I suspect it was added to keep irq.c in sync
    with i386, but even the CONFIG_GENERIC_HARDIRQS code (<hint>which IA64

    The problem with using shost_for_each_device wrt to the above oops is
    that scsi_forget_host sets the state to SDEV_CANCEL, so that when
    scsi_host_cancel iterates over the devices using shost_for_each_device
    it cannot get a handle to the sdev (scsi_device_get fails becuase the
    state is set to SDEV_CANCEL). And, __scsi_iterate_devices does not clear
    the next pointer if this happens, so I think this is needed to fix just
    the refcount bug in shost_for_each_device.

    [PATCH] fbcon: Disable fbcon cursor if vt softcursor is enabled
    
    Problem reported by Gerd Knorr:
    
      (1) boot with vesafb (thats what I'm using, maybe it shows on other
          framebuffers and/or vgacon as well).
      (2) login into one terminal, then type "echo -ne '\033[?17;15;239c'".
          You should have a nice, yellow and *not* blinking cursor block.
          That is what I have in my .profile because I can't stand the
          blinking cursors.
      (3) Switch to another terminal.  The cursor goes into blinking
          underscore mode now (i.e. the default cursor).
      (4) Switch back to the first terminal.  Now you have a yellow block
          with the last two pixel lines (i.e. the underscore) blinking.
    
    This bug is caused by both fbcon_cursor and vt softcursor being active at
    the same time.
    
    Fix:
    
    - Disable fbcon_cursor if vt softcursor is active (vc->vc_cursor_type &
      0x10) != 0.
    
    - Recheck/reload fbcon cursor for each vt switch

    [PATCH] fbdev: Fix for using >16 pixel wide font in fb console
    
    From: Jani Jaakkola <jjaakkol@cs.Helsinki.FI>:
    
    The first one was that fbcon_set_font() used one byte padding for fonts having
    width 16 <= width < 24, which was wrong since the pieces of code actually
    using the font did not use any padding.  This is fixed in the included patch
    and also fbcon_set_font() is made a little cleaner.  After the patch the
    following font is not garbled in fb console:
    http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jjaakkol/psf/bitstream_vera_sans_mono_roman.16x30.psf
    
    The other bug is that fonts having height == 32 crash the kernel.  I have no
    fix for this (at least not yet), but it can be reproduced with font:

    [PATCH] cdev_init: zero out cdev before kobject_init()
    
    Right now, cdev_init() works in a way that is not very intuitive.  If a
    driver passes an uninitialized struct cdev to cdev_init(), then an
    uninitialized struct kobject will be passed to kobject_init(), which does
    kset_get() on kobj->kset, which probably points off into space and causes
    an oops.  Drivers can work around this by zeroing out their struct cdev in
    advance (and indeed most if not all of the things passed to cdev_init()
    come from BSS) but I think it makes more sense for cdev_init() to live up
    to its name and actually work on an uninitialized cdev.

    [PATCH] Multilink fix for ppp_generic.c
    
    I released ppp-2.4.3 yesterday, with much improved support for multilink
    operation - when the first link is terminated, its pppd no longer exits
    immediately, but keeps running in order to keep the ppp interface up while
    there are other links still in the bundle.
    
    However, this shows up a bug in the kernel ppp driver, which is that there is
    no way for the pppd controlling the bundle to know when the last link in the
    bundle is terminated.  This patch provides such a way: with this patch, pppd
    will get an EOF when reading from the /dev/ppp instance for the bundle when
    there are no channels connected.
    
    The change does not affect older versions of pppd or normal non-multilink
    operation (I have tested to make sure of that).

    [PATCH] Don't remove /sys in initramfs
    
    Using the "resume" kernel parameter together with an initramfs revealed a
    bug that causes removal of the /sys directory in the initramfs' tmpfs,
    making the system unbootable.
    
    The source of the problem is that the try_name() function removes the /sys
    directory unconditionally, instead of removing it only when it has been
    created by try_name().
    
    The attached patch only removes /sys if it has been created before.

    [PATCH] kNFSd: fix d_find_alias brokenness
    
    10 weeks ago,
      http://linux.bkbits.com:8080/linux-2.5/cset@415b3380pxf4sB97gM8ujLqDxi6GfQ
    
    The patch was mostly right, and fixed a real problem, but missed a bit.
    
    It passed the job of checking if an inode had a current alias off to
    d_find_alias instead of open-coding it in d_alloc_anon.  However there is one
    case where d_alloc_anon would not return the right dentry.  That case being
    when the inode was for the root of the filesystem.
    
    The root is a special case because it is not hashed.  All other dentries that
    are not hashed are quite un-interesting: There are "unlinked" but not yet
    closed.  The root of a filesystem is unhashed, but is interesting.
    
    Allowing d_find_alias to return an unhashed alias for a directory solves this
    problem.  It is safe because callers of d_find_alias on a directory inode
    either have a name for the inode already (so finding an unlinked directory by
    mistake is impossible) or will soon be looking for a name and will drop the
    dentry if a name is not found.

    [PATCH] radix_tree_delete() fix
    
    I was looking through the radix tree code and came across what I think
    is a bug in radix_tree_delete.
    
    	for (idx = 0; idx < RADIX_TREE_TAG_LONGS; idx++) {
    		if (pathp[0].node->tags[tag][idx]) {
    			tags[tag] = 1;
    			nr_cleared_tags--;
    			break;
    		}
    	}
    
    The above loop should only be executed if tags[tag] is zero.  Otherwise,
    when walking up the tree, we can decrement nr_cleared_tags twice or more
    for the same value of tag, thus potentially exiting the outer loop too
    early.
    
    Ensure that nr_cleared_tags is only decremented once for each tag.

    This one covers the fact, that the SIGSEGV signal, which is created by
    force_sigsegv() in case of an error in handle_signal(), is not delivered to
    the user immediately.  In the worst case it even could be masked if a
    sigprocmask() systemcall follows immediately after return from kernel.  The
    patch is relevant for other architectures, too.

    [PATCH] uml: fix signal mask on delivery error
    
    From: Bodo Stroesser <bstroesser@fujitsu-siemens.com>
    
    If the user stack limit is reached or the signal stack assigned with
    sigaltstack() is invalid when a user signal handler with SA_ONSTACK has to be
    started, the signal mask of the interrupted user program is modified.  This
    happens because the mask, that should be used with the handler only, is
    written to "current->blocked" even if the handler could not be started.  But
    without a handler, no rewrite of the original mask at sys_sigreturn will be
    done.
    
    A slightly different case is sys_sigsuspend(), where the mask is already
    modified when kern_do_signal() is started.  "*oldset" and "current->blocked"
    are not equal here and thus current->blocked has to be set to *oldset, if an
    error occurs in handle_signal().
    
    For both cases I've written small tests, and with the patch the result is OK.
    This issue is relevant for other architectures too (e.g.  i386, I've seen).

    [PATCH] m32r: update for m32r-g00ff
    
    This patchset was originally from NIIBE Yutaka.
    
    These patch update the m32r kernel for a new bootloader "m32r-g00ff".  The
    "m32r-g00ff" has been written and developed by NIIBE Yutaka, and released
    under the GPL from http://www.gniibe.org/.
    
    So far, it supports two types of booting operations,
    CF boot and Network boot (HTTP boot).
    
     * CF boot - boot from CompactFlash or Microdrive(TM)
       We can boot a kernel from CF device.
       To make use of m32r-g00ff, we just put a first stage IPL(initial program
       loader) into a flash memory, and a secondary bootloader into CF media device.
       Currently, LILO-21.4.4 can be used to write m32r-g00ff into the boot sector
       of CF device on a cross development environment.
    
     * HTTP boot - boot via network with HTTP protocol
       By using m32r-g00ff, we can download and boot a kernel image from
       a web-server.  The m32r-g00ff downloads a kernel image from a given URL,
       resolving the webserver's IP address by DNS.
       As a preparation, we just place a secondary bootloader binary and
       a kernel image on the webserver.
    
    - Position-independent zImage support;
      this aims at removing constraints of zImage(vmlinuz)'s location.

    [PATCH] i386: apic_printk() used before initialized
    
    Both detect_init_APIC() and init_apic_mappings() it's called from are
    invoked early, before the command line has been processed.  Therefore its
    meaningless to call apic_printk() from them as that depends on
    apic_verbosity which is initialized from the command line.
    
    I could move apic_verbosity initialization to parse_cmdline_early(), but I
    think that would be an overkill, the point being we are initerested in
    feedback from detect_init_APIC() anyway.  Without that it's hard to tell
    what's really going on as it's been the case with the recent report of the
    local APIC being non-functional despite the whole setup being apparently
    correct.  So I converted these calls to ordinary printk() invocations.  The
    init_apic_mappings() are less interesting, so I've made them output at the
    debug level.
    
    While at it I've made some obvious nearby formatting clean-up.

    [PATCH] add cpu_relax() in spin loops & clean up barrier()
    
    The patch adds cpu_relax() in the body of some spin loops for 2.6.9.  The
    patch also removes redundant barrier() code after cpu_relax() on ia32.
    
    In the PAUSE instruction section, IA32 SDM claims "it is recommended that a
    PASUE instruction be placed in all spin-wait loops".  And x86_64 SDM says
    that PAUSE instruction is same as legacy mode in IA-32e mode operation.
    
    This patch is against 2.6.9 (kernel.org).  It was tested on ia32 and
    x86_64.

    [PATCH] PPC64 rtasd: window when error_log_cnt could get zeroed
    
    This patch is from Jake Moilanen <moilanen@austin.ibm.com>.
    
    There appears to be a hole that if we get an log_error() call, that we could
    zero out our error log count in nvram.
    
    When rtasd() starts up, it turns on the logging via 'no_more_logging = 0'.  If
    we get a log_error() call after that is set but before nvram_read_error_log
    has actually read nvram to set error_log_cnt, the log_error() call will write
    back to nvram a uninitialized error_log_cnt value, and wipe out our sequence
    number.
    
    To close the hole, simply move the 'no_more_logging = 0' till after nvram sets
    error_log_cnt but before pSeries_log_error is called.
    
    I also changed the 'no_more_logging' variable to be 'no_logging' since it's
    not only used when we stop logging now.  I also removed the "volatile" part of
    no_more_logging, since it's unneeded.

    [PATCH] ppc64: iSeries legacy model emulation of PURR
    
    Here's a patch to extend the current Linux on Power support for PURR to
    legacy IBM iSeries servers (pre-Power5 processor models).  This patch
    enables the reporting of timebase metrics to reflect physical processor
    utilization in a system running multiple logical partitions which share the
    same physical processors.
    
    The patch simply uses existing user interfaces for Linux IBM Power5 based
    servers to report data already collected by the hypervisor.  The values
    reported with each call are running values in units of the system timebase.
     The calculation of physical processor utilization results from two samples
    (purr1 and purr2) differing by a know interval (time) such that:
    
        physical utilization = (purr2 - purr1) / (time * number of procs *
    timebase)
    
    where the number of procs and timebase can be obtained from /proc/cpuinfo.
    
    Applications have been written to the interface already defined and these
    applications have value back on the legacy iSeries models.

    [PATCH] low discontig highmem_start_page
    
    In the case of i386 CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM CONFIG_HIGHMEM without highmem,
    highmem_start_page was wrongly initialized (from a NULL zone_mem_map),
    causing __change_page_attr to BUG on boot.

    high     128        160         192
    
    without patch:
                                 | GFP_KERNEL        | GFP_ATOMIC
    allocate immediately         |   9 dma, 469 norm |  9 dma, 469 norm
    allocate after waking kswapd |   5 dma, 234 norm |  3 dma,  88 norm
    allocate after synch reclaim |   5 dma, 234 norm |  n/a

    allocate after waking kswapd |  18 dma,  940 norm |  6 dma,  440 norm
    allocate after synch reclaim |  18 dma,  940 norm |  n/a
    
    So the buffer between GFP_KERNEL and GFP_ATOMIC allocations is:
    
    2.6.8      | 465 dma, 117 norm, 582 tot = 2328K
    2.6.10-rc  |   2 dma, 146 norm, 148 tot =  592K
    patch      |  12 dma, 500 norm, 512 tot = 2048K
    
    Which is getting pretty good.
    
    kswap starts at:
    2.6.8     477 dma, 496 norm, 973 total
    2.6.10-rc   8 dma, 468 norm, 476 total
    patched    17 dma, 939 norm, 956 total
    
    So in terms of total pages, that's looking similar to 2.6.8.

    [PATCH] x86-64: Fix get_user_pages access to vsyscall page
    
    The current kernel oopses on x86-64 when gdb steps into the vsyscall page.
    This patch fixes it.
    
    I also removed the bogus NULL checks of *_offset and replaced them with
    proper _none checks.  I made them BUGs because vsyscall pages should be
    always mapped.

    [ARM PATCH] 2234/3: S3C2410 - new serial driver (1/4)
    
    Patch from Ben Dooks
    
    S3C2410/S3C2440 new serial driver
    
    this patch includes the following
    
    - clock selection using clock core
    - handling for both 2410 and 2440 uarts
    - uart suspend/resume support
    - Dimitry Andric's fix for un-initialised spinlocks
    - Herbert Poetzl's fixes for the following
    -> break character recognition
    -> Magic-SYSRQ handling
    -> Uart software flow control (IrDA console)
    
    Updated to include rmk's comments from Patch #2234/1
    and fix a few checks for serial clocks, as well as
    merging fixes from rmk that had taken time to go
    through the biteepr to release.

    [NETFILTER]: Cleanup find_appropriate_src() Fix
    
    The fix to find_appropriate_src left a stupid test, which has no
    effect but is incoherent at best.  It covers a corner case: if a
    previous connection from this source was mapped onto a different IP
    address (because it was explicitly told to), should the next one be
    mapped that was as well, if no explicit rule says to remap the src IP?
    
    I think the answer is yes: unless the user explicitly tells us to map
    into a particular range, we should follow the Kegel draft.

    [ARM PATCH] 2240/1: S3C2410 - clock device id update
    
    Patch from Ben Dooks
    
    Clock code now uses the supplied device to check for
    the id of the clock, so uart clocks are now simply
    "uart" instead of "uart0", "uart1" and "uart2"

    [PATCH] __init and i386 timers
    
    The i386 timers use a struct timer_opts that has a field init
    pointing at a __init function. The rest of the struct is not __init.
    
    Nothing is wrong, but if we want to avoid having references to init stuff
    in non-init sections, some reshuffling is needed.
    
    The below replaces
    
    struct timer_opts {
    	int (*init)(char *override);
    	... more ...
    };
    
    by the two structs
    
    struct timer_opts {
    	... more ...
    };
    
    struct init_time_opts {
    	int (*init)(char *override);
    	struct timer_opts *opts;
    };
    
    where the second is __initdata.

    [PATCH] __init for inflate.c
    
    In do_mounts_rd.c and initramfs.c there are many references

    The below adds INIT markup in lib/inflate.c.

    [PATCH] __devinit in sound/oss/es1371.c
    
    It is forbidden to refer from __devinit to __init.  (Unless one argues
    that in the given situation hotplugging is actually impossible.  Too
    ugly.)
    
    However, es1371_probe() is __devinit and referred to __initdata initvol[]
    and to __init src_init().

    [PATCH] remove if !PARTITION_ADVANCED condition in defaults
    
    Many people are being bitten by the fact that if they select
    CONFIG_PARTITION_ADVANCED in order to get some additional support,
    they suddenly lose support for the MSDOS_PARTITION type.
    
    Moreover, everybody needs MSDOS_PARTITION - also people not on i386,
    since it is the type used on smart media and compact flash and
    similar cards.
    
    So, the below advises people "Say Y here" for MSDOS_PARTITION,
    and does not change the default choices when PARTITION_ADVANCED
    is selected.

    I had another look at the ugly rivafb memory ordering requirements.
    
    It seems P{V,C}IO areas are only accessed using VGA_{RD,WR}8 macros.
    NV_{RW,WR}08 are never actually used directly.  So this patch makes at
    least usage consistent: VGA_{RD,WR}8 to access "I/O areas" in an ordered
    way.  NV_* for the rest.

    [PATCH] EDD: fix too short array
    
    Bingo...  edd_devices[] was too short.  When we keep more than 6
    signatures, it overruns the end.  Also, I rewrote edd_num_devices to be
    clearer about its goal.
    
    This patch is necessary even after the last edd.S patch was reverted.
    
    Thanks to Christian Kujau for testing and narrowing it down enough to
    debug this.
    
    It still doesn't explain why Christian's BIOS reports more devices than
    he has, that's still up in the air, so don't re-apply the edd.S patch
    just reverted.

    OK.  Tested now on real hardware in 32 bit and 64 bit kernels.  32 bit
    found another dumbness, that we can fix up.
    
    Some PCI bridges default their UPPER prefetch windows to an unused state
    of base > limit.  We should not use those values if we find that.  It
    might be nice to reprogram them to 0, in fact.
    
    Yes, BIOS should fix that up, but apparently, some do not.

    [PATCH] USB: io_ti new devices, circular buffer, flow control, misc fixes
    
    - Updated to version 0.7.
    
    - Added support for Edgeport 4s, 221c, 22c, 21c, 1, 1i, Watchports,
      Plus Power Port HP4CD, and Plus Power Port PCI.
    
    - Added a circular write buffer and locking to protect it.  This fixes
      OPOST processing problems.
    
    - Rewrote TIChase to wait for the circular buffer to drain, to wait
      up to the closing wait time, and to wait for the last character out.
    
    - Fixed hardware flow control by having it stop and restart reads
      and set and clear tty->hw_stopped.
    
    - Removed the RELEVANT_IFLAG macro which mistakenly filtered out the
      software flow control stty flags.
    
    - Added a semaphore to to protect num_ports_open to fix a race
      during simultaneous opens--two opens could both try to submit
      the interrupt urb, an error.
    
    - Added a separate write_urb_in_use flag rather than relying
      on (urb->status == -EINPROGRESS).
    
    - Added edge_tty_recv to pass data to the tty flip buffers.
    
    - Freed memory on failed startup.
    
    - Added low latency as a module parameter, it is on by default.
    
    - Added closing wait as a module parameter, it is 40 seconds by default.
    
    - Simplified rounding the baud rate divisor.
    
    - Added some error messages.

    [PATCH] I2C: Recent I2C "dead code removal" breaks pmac sound.
    
    > Put the function back, and change the pmac.h file to delete the #define,
    > and replace the snd_pmac_keywest_write function with a real call to

    > Care to write a patch to do this?
    
    It follows, along with an update of the include/linux/i2c.h to only
    declare functions that actually exist, but grepping the whole sound
    subtree shows that at least sound/oss/dmasound/tas_common.h defines
    a few inline functions that call i2c_smbus_write_{byte,block}_data.
    
    
    [I2C part]
    Ressuscitate i2c_smbus_write_block_data since it's actually
    used. Update include/linux/i2c.h to reflect the existing
    functions.
    
    [Sound part]
    Remove snd_pmac_keywest_write* wrapper macros and directly
    call the i2c_smbus_* functions instead.

    I am trying to fix the current ACPI container.ko and processor.ko to use
    kobject_hotplug() for notification. For this I would be requiring the
    KOBJ_ONLINE definitions to be added to kobject_action.

    I wondered why greg thought the type was wrong.   After it was merged I
    realized that the wrong function was changed.  Here's an attempt to fix
    both errors.

    [PATCH] driver core: shrink struct device a bit
    
    This patch removes two fields from "struct device" that are duplicated
    in "struct dev_pm_info":  power_state (which should probably vanish)
    and "saved_state".  There were only two "real" uses of saved_state;
    both are now switched over to use dev_pm_info.

    [PATCH] fakephp: add pci bus rescan ability
    
    This adds the ability to rescan the pci bus for newly inserted,
    reprogrammed or previously disabled pci devices.
    To initiate a rescan you need to write '1' to any of the
    /sys/bus/pci/slots/*/power control files. No known pci devices
    will be touched.
    Additionally this fixes a bug, when someone tries to disable
    a device with subfunctions. The subfunctions will be disabled first now.
    
    Short demo:
     # modprobe fakephp
     # ls /sys/bus/pci/slots | grep "0000:04"
    0000:04:02.0

    [PATCH] USB: revised usbserial open/close unbalanced get/put
    
    Here is a new version of the patch to usb-serial.c to fix
    the unbalanced kref and module get/put in serial_open and
    serial_close when there are errors.  This version works
    correctly when try_module_get fails and now "rmmod --wait"
    works correctly.
    
    
    * If the low level usb serial open fails, the kref and
      module use counts are decremented once in open.  Before,
      they were mistakenly decremented again in close.
    
    * If try_module_get fails, the module use count is not
      changed.  Before, the module use count was mistakenly
      decremented.  Now "rmmod --wait" works correctly.
    
    * The tty->driver_data pointer is never set to NULL once
      the port is open.  Before there was a small window when
      it was mistakenly set to NULL for an already open port.

    [PATCH] USB: io_edgeport locking, flow control, and misc fixes
    
    [PATCH] io_edgeport locking, flow control, and misc fixes
    
    - Updated to version 2.7.
    
    - Added locking to protect the circular buffer, txCredits, rxBytesAvail,
      and read_in_progress.
    
    - With these locking fixes tests running 8 ports at 115200 bps on
      SMP now runs for hours without problems; before these changes this
      test would cause out of memory errors or oopses within minutes.
    
    - Removed the RELEVANT_IFLAG macro which mistakenly filtered out the
      software flow control stty flags.
    
    - Added support for mark and space parity.
    
    - Added a private read_in_progress flag rather than using (urb->status
      == -EINPROGRESS).
    
    - Low latency is now a module parameter, it is on by default.
    
    - Added edge_tty_recv to pass data to the tty flip buffers.
    
    - Cleared the write_urb pointer after freeing it, to prevent oops on
      failed open.
    
    - Cleared the txfifo.fifo pointer after freeing it, to prevent double
      free on failed open.
    
    - Simplified rounding the baud rate divisor.
    
    - Added some error messages.

    [PKT_SCHED]: Fix overflow on 64bit in times reported to userspace.
    
    This patch fixes on overflow in tc actions times reported to
    userspace on 64 bit architectures. struct tcf_t only contains
    32-bit timestamps, but they are initialized to jiffies. When
    jiffies is larger than 2^32-1 only the low 32 bit are saved,
    and the diff between jiffies and the current timestamp becomes
    very large. This happens immediately after boottime since jiffies
    is initialized to 2^32-300. It was invisible until now because
    only the lower 32bit were reported to userspace, but with the
    USER_HZ conversion the reported times start somewhere around
    4294967s.
    
    This patch extends the timestamps to 64bit. It breaks userspace
    compatibility for actions, but considering that most of this is
    not even in iproute yet this should be acceptable.

    [PATCH] fbdev: Fix broken fb_blank() implementation.
    
    This patch fixes some of the drivers' fb_blank() implementation which got
    the usage of the VESA_* constants incorrectly and converts them to use the
    new FB_BLANK-* constants.
    
    I'm not sure if what I did is correct for all drivers, so maintainers,
    please review.
    
    (Note: For most of the drivers, FB_BLANK_NORMAL is treated as
    FB_BLANK_UNBLANK, but returns a nonzero so fbcon will do a soft_blank).

    [PATCH] fbdev: Introduce FB_BLANK_* constants
    
    The VESA_* constants in fb.h used for power management of the display is
    confusing to use.  The constants seems to be meant for userspace, because
    within the kernel (vt and fbdev), the constants have to be incremented by
    1.  Implementation of fb_blank() varies from driver to driver:
    
    - if-else on blank/!blank
    
    - switch case on hardcoded numbers
    
    - switch case on the constants + 1
    
    - switch -1, case  on constants as is
    
    - switch case on the constants as is (broken)
    
    To make usage clearer, new constants are defined in fb.h:
    
    FB_BLANK_UNBLANK  = VESA_UNBLANKING = 0;
    FB_BLANK_NORMAL = VESA_UNBLANKING + 1 = 1;
    FB_BLANK_VSYNC_SUSPEND = VESA_VSYNC_SUSPEND + 1 = 2;
    FB_BLANK_HSYNC_SUSPEND = VESA_HSYNC_SUSPEND + 1 = 3;
    FB_BLANK_POWERDOWN = VESA_POWERDOWN + 1 = 4;
    
    Other changes:
    
    - generic blanking code in fbcon.c (for drivers without an fb_blank hook)
      which either sets the palette to all black, or clear the screen with
      black.
    
    - make fb_display an unexportable symbol

    This is a update for the saa7134 driver, changes:
    
     * adapt to the video-buf changes.
     * add new cards.
     * split mpeg encoder card support to separare module
       (saa7134-empress), as preparation for the dvb support
       which also uses the MPEG capabilities of the card.
     * started working on dvb support (not functional yet, also
       marked 'BROKEN').
     * convert insmod options to new-style.

    [PATCH] v4l: yet another video-buf interface update
    
    This is one more interface fix for the video-buf.c module, the first
    attempt on that wasn't that clever.  Instead of passing the driver private
    data through all function calls I've just made that an element of the
    videobuf_queue struct which is passed around everythere _anyway_.
    
    That removes some reduncancy, should be less error prone and gain me some
    points on rusty's interface design scala ;)
    
    It also fixes the tvtime crashes which where caused by overviewing one
    place to fixup in the first attempt.

    [PATCH] Fix CPM2 uart driver device number brain damage
    
    The following patch against 2.6.10-rc1 fixes the brain damage that was
    found in the CPM2 uart driver.  Previously, if 8250 was configured in, it
    would use one set of numbers (which at the time didn't conflict with
    anything, but have since been officially given to the Motorola i.MX driver)
    and if 8250 wasn't in, it would masquerade as it.  The following switches
    us over to 204/46...49 (Which is still unclaimed).

    [PATCH] statfs compat functions can return EOVERFLOW on NFS
    
    A while ago, we fixed a problem in statfs on 64bit system that caused it
    to return EOVERFLOW when the number of files reported by the underlying
    file system was -1 (which happens for NFS for instance). The problematic
    code was this:
    
            if (sizeof ubuf->f_blocks == 4) {
                    if ((kbuf->f_blocks | kbuf->f_bfree |
                         kbuf->f_bavail | kbuf->f_files | kbuf->f_ffree) &
                        0xffffffff00000000ULL)
                            return -EOVERFLOW;
    		...
    	}
    
    The problem was fixed by explicitly allowing f_files and f_ffree to be -1.
    
    The same problem exists in fs/compat.c, and the attached patch fixes it
    in a similar manner.

    [PATCH] sparc32: fix for HyperSPARC DMA errors
    
    I found a solution for the HyperSPARC DMA problems in 2.6.  This allows my
    SS20 with HyperSPARCs to boot to single user.  It's not efficient, but I
    hope it points out whats needed for a proper fix.  Seems that the iotlb
    entries need to flushed to ram or uncached since the iommu changes between
    2.5.60 and 2.5.70.
    
    The second part seems to be needed to allow consistent sbus dma mappings to
    be cached on HyperSPARC.  I have also tested this change on 2.4.27 with no
    noticeable difference.

    [PATCH] ext3 umount hang
    
    When an ext3 partition is mounted and then quickly unmounted, the journal
    thread never gets around to checking the JFS_UNMOUNT flag (it immediately
    goes into a loop waiting for a new sequence number), causing the umount
    process to hang in journal_kill_thread().
    
    The problem can be easily reproduced by roughly the following steps:
    
    	dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/qf bs=1024k count=10
    	yes | mke2fs -j /tmp/qf
    	losetup /dev/loop0 /tmp/qf
    	mkdir /mnt/qf
    	mount -t ext3 /dev/loop0 /mnt/qf ; umount /mnt/qf
    
    The patch below moves the check for JFS_UNMOUNT to the beginning of the
    journal thread loop, thereby preventing this race condition.

    [PATCH] futex_wait hang fix
    
    NPTL has 3 control counters (total/wake/woken).
    so NPTL can know:
      "how many threads enter to wait"(total),
      "how many threads receive wake signal"(wake),
      and "how many threads exit waiting"(woken).
    
    Abstraction of pthread_cond_wait and pthread_cond_signal are:
    
    A01 pthread_cond_wait {
    A02   timeout = 0;
    A03   lock(counters);
    A04     total++;
    A05     val = get_from(futex);
    A06   unlock(counters);
    A07
    A08   sys_futex(futex, FUTEX_WAIT, val, timeout);
    A09
    A10   lock(counters);
    A11     woken++;
    A12   unlock(counters);
    A13 }
    
    B01 pthread_cond_signal {
    B02   lock(counters);
    B03   if(total>wake) { /* if there is waiter */
    B04     wake++;
    B05     update_val(futex);
    B06     sys_futex(futex, FUTEX_WAKE, 1);
    B07   }
    B08   unlock(counters);
    B09 }
    
    What we have to notice is:
        FUTEX_WAKE could be called before FUTEX_WAIT have called (at A07).
    In such case, FUTEX_WAKE will fail if there is no thread in waitqueue.
    
    However, since pthread_cond_signal do not only wake++ but also
    update_val(futex), next FUTEX_WAIT will fail with -EWOULDBLOCK because the val
    passed to WAIT is now not equal to updated val.  Therefore, as the result, it
    seems that the WAKE wakes the WAIT.
    
    ===
    
    The bug will appear if 2 pair of wait & wake called at (nearly)once:
    
       * Assume 4 threads, wait_A, wait_B, wake_X, and wake_Y
       * counters start from [total/wake/woken]=[0/0/0]
       * the val of futex starts from (0), update means inclement of the val.
       * there is no thread in waitqueue on the futex.
    
    [simulation]
    
    wait_A: calls pthread_cond_wait:
        total++, prepare to call FUTEX_WAIT with val=0.
        # status: [1/0/0] (0) queue={}(empty) #
    
    wake_X: calls pthread_cond_signal:
        no one in waitqueue, just wake++ and update futex val.
        # status: [1/1/0] (1) queue={}(empty) #
    
    wait_B: calls pthread_cond_wait:
        total++, prepare to call FUTEX_WAIT with val=1.
        # status: [2/1/0] (1) queue={}(empty) #
    
    wait_A: calls FUTEX_WAIT with val=0:
        after queueing, compare val. 0!=1 ... this should be blocked...
        # status: [2/1/0] (1) queue={A} #
    
    wait_B: calls FUTEX_WAIT with val=1:
        after queueing, compare val. 1==1 ... OK, let's schedule()...
        # status: [2/1/0] (1) queue={A,B} (B=sleeping) #
    
    wake_Y: calls pthread_cond_signal:
        A is in waitqueue ... dequeue A, wake++ and update futex val.
        # status: [2/2/0] (2) queue={B} (B=sleeping) #
    
    wait_A: end of FUTEX_WAIT with val=0:
        try to dequeue but already dequeued, return anyway.
        # status: [2/2/0] (2) queue={B} (B=sleeping) #
    
    wait_A: end of pthread_cond_wait:
        woken++.
        # status: [2/2/1] (2) queue={B} (B=sleeping) #
    
    This is bug:
       wait_A: wakeup
       wait_B: sleeping
       wake_X: wake A
       wake_Y: wake A again
    
    if subsequent wake_Z try to wake B:
    
    wake_Z: calls pthread_cond_signal:
        since total==wake, do nothing.
        # status: [2/2/1] (2) queue={B} (B=sleeping) #
    
    If wait_C comes, B become to can be woken, but C...
    
    This bug makes the waitqueue to trap some threads in it all time.

    =====
    
    In short:
    There is an un-documented behavior of futex_wait. This behavior misleads
    NPTL to wake a thread doubly, as the result, causes an application hang.

    Using NPTL, getpid() sometimes delivers the wrong pid, since it uses the
    one buffered in TLS from previous calls.  This buffered pid isn't
    discarded, when a child is created by a clone().
    
    So, as a workaround, UML should use a direct kernel call to bypass the lib.
    
    Also, I (Paolo) went replacing all remaining calls of getpid() with
    os_getpid(), to make sure they use the syscall and not the normal glibc
    definition.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix for cpu hotplug + NUMA
    
    It was possible to hotplug add a new cpu that was larger than numnode.
    This meant we had a cpu with a node id that didnt have any NODE_DATA()
    backing it.
    
    The following patch catches this in numa_setup_cpu and forces the node to
    0.  We also make a pass through all cpus at boot to look for the maximum
    node id - this catches the case at boot.  As for hotplug, since the node
    doesnt have any memory backing it (otherwise the node would have been
    onlined) then we can assume the machine isnt configured for performance and
    just force the cpu into node 0.

    	- replace some painful code that converts a byte array to
    	  a couple of u32's and then shifts and masks the bytes back out.

    [PATCH] remove contention on profile_lock
    
    profile_hook unconditionally takes a read lock on profile_lock if kernel
    profiling is enabled.  The lock protects the profile_hook notifier chain
    from being written while it's being called.  The routine profile_hook is
    called in a very hot path though: every timer tick on every CPU.  As you
    can imagine, on a large system, this makes the cacheline containing
    profile_lock pretty hot.  Since oprofile was the only user of the
    profile_hook, I removed the notifier chain altogether in favor of a simple
    function pointer with the help of John Levon.  This removes all of the
    contention in the hot path since the variable is very seldom written and
    simplifies things a little to boot.

    [PATCH] USB: SN9C10x driver updates
    
    SN9C10x driver updates.
    
    The most important change is the addition of the "SN9C10x" vendor-specific
    pixel format, which is used by the applications or libraries to get "raw"
    compressed data from the SN9C10x controllers. This also means that V4L2 should
    be smart enough for the decompression to be handled in userland. You can
    consider this patch as a further response to the discussion we had on the lkml
    about the submission of the PWC driver including decompression in kernelspace,
    which is present in the Alan Cox's tree.
    
    Changes: (+ new, - removed, * cleanup, @ bugfix)
    
    @ Fix VIDIOC_TRY_FMT ioctl
    @ Fix SOF/EOF problems with TAS5130D1B image sensor
    @ Fix VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT ioctl
    * Replace wait_event_interruptible() with wait_event_timeout()
    * Use msecs_to_jiffies() for timeouts in jiffies
    * Use usb_make_path() on VIDIOC_QUERYCAP for device path in the usb tree
    * read() returns buf.bytesused instead of buf.length on success
    - Remove brightness control from PAS106B and PAS202BCB, since it has no effect
      on the active pixel area (it's just for window border lines)
    + Implement VIDIOC_G_PARM and VIDIOC_S_PARM ioctl's
    + Add DAC magnitude, DAC sign, green balance and exposure controls for PAS106B
      and PAS202BCB image sensors
    + Add an additional pixel format for compressed video: V4L2_PIX_FMT_SN9C10X
    + VIDIOC_S_JPEGCOMP and VIDIOC_G_JPEGCOMP are used to set or get the current
      compression quality
    + New documentation note in "Notes for V4L2 application developers" paragraph
      about video formats and compressed data.
    + Documentation updates about the new features

    [PATCH] USB: usb PM updates, OHCI (3/4)
    
    These OHCI updates go along with usbcore changes to avoid power_state
    (mostly for sysfs) and leave usbcore handling usb_device state (except
    for quick-disconnect on STD resume).
    
     - detect and ignore a root hub status polling call made during
       suspend without USB_RESUME (it'd act like CardBus eject...)
    
     - detect and ignore a superfluous root hub resume call made in
       some cases with USB_RESUME
    
     - use irqsave spinlock calls in timer callback paths
    
     - don't expect usbcore to understand "disconnect the root hub"
    
     - avoid some pointless delays/faults
    
    So it should fix a lot of the problems folk have been having with
    OHCI in the latest 2.6.10-rc1-bk kernels.

    [PATCH] USB: usb PM updates, root hub stuff (2/4)
    
    Makes usbcore handle some suspend scenarios more consistently, especially
    when talking with root hubs.
    
     - Use usb_device->state, not device->power.power_state.  (The driver model
       power_state is still needed for interfaces.)  With USB_SUSPEND=n, there
       are also cases where the HCD_STATE_SUSPENDED needs to be used instead
       of testing for USB_STATE_SUSPENDED.
    
     - Updates usb_device->state for root hubs during suspend/resume.
    
     - Fixes a locking bug (extra "up") that got merged recently, affecting
       CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND.
    
     - Recover one of the "HC died" cases better.
    
     - Root hub timer updates, handling various suspend transitions more
       consistently:  don't duplicate earlier submit checks, only work
       when hub is configured, address various submit/resume races.
    
    Together, these help hubs work better regardless of whether USB_SUSPEND
    has been enabled (that's the only way USB_STATE_SUSPENDED appears), and
    whether or not the HCD is marked as suspended (or maybe Alan would
    want to call that "half suspended").

    [PATCH] USB: usb PM updates, PCI glue (1/4)
    
    Updates the PCI glue for HCDs:
    
     - There's now just one code path to suspend. CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND mostly
       means bypassing the "idle the root hub" part, and it uses the same
       D1/D2 logic when necessary.
    
     - Though usbcore is moving away from device->power.power_state, it still
       needs to be initialized correctly (else pmcore can get confused).
    
     - Disable the device on init path failures.
    
    The first two address real bugs, the third was just something I noticed
    while fixing the second.

    [PATCH] USB: EHCI and APM suspend
    
    I've been having some problems with the EHCI driver on my Thinkpad T40,
    running 2.6.9 with APM instead of ACPI.  On resume after suspend-to-RAM
    the EHCI hardware keeps the interrupt line high, but the EHCI driver is
    not clearing the interrupt status register, causing Linux to eventually
    disable the interrupt altogether.
    
    The attached patch for ehci-hub.c does the obvious thing: delay enabling
    interrupts until hcd->state is set to USB_STATE_RUNNING.

    [PATCH] PCI: pci-mmconfig fix
    
    Here I have attached pci mmconfig fix for 2.6.9 kernel.
    
    This will fix the flush error in pci_mmcfg_write.
    
    When pci_mmcfg_write is used to program the PMCSR in the Power
    Management Capability structure of PCI config space in the PCI Express
    device to a different power state, the dummy readl to flush the previous
    write violates the transition delay specified in the PCI power
    management spec. Please see PCI Power Management Spec. 1.2 Table 5-6.
    For example, while changing the power state of the device through PMCSR
    register, a transition delay of 10msec is required before any access can
    be made to the device.
    
    Since the configuration write access for PCI Express is non posted,
    flushing is not necessary and  it will be safe to remove the dummy
    readl.
    
    This patch will remove dummy readl function implemented in
    "pci_mmcfg_write" and use set_fixmap_nocahe instead of set_fixmap.

    [IA64] speedup ptrace by avoiding kernel-stack walk
    
    This patch changes the syscall entry path to store the
    current-frame-mask (CFM) in pt_regs->cr_ifs.  This just takes one
    extra instruction (a "dep" to clear the bits other than 0-37) and is
    free in terms of cycles.
    
    The advantage of doing this is that it lets ptrace() avoid having to
    walk the stack to determine the end of the user-level backing-store of
    a process which is in the middle of a system-call.  Since this is what
    strace does all the time, this speeds up strace quite a bit (by ~50%).
    More importantly, it makes the syscall vs. non-syscall case much more
    symmetric, which is always something I wanted.
    
    Note that the change to ivt.S looks big but this is just a rippling
    effect of instruction-scheduling to keep syscall latency the same.
    All that's really going on there is that instead of storing 0 into
    cr_ifs member we store the low 38 bits of ar.pfs.

    [ARM PATCH] 2160/1: allow modules to work with XIP kernel
    
    Patch from Nicolas Pitre
    
    This should be applied on top of patch #2154/1.
    
    This maps the XIP kernel in the same virtual area as used for kernel
    modules instead of the previous arbitrary location.  Doing so has the
    advantage of having a well defined kernel address not conflicting
    with the different definitions for VMALLOC_END, as well as making
    modules loadable without any indirect long branch calls.  The work
    on XIPable MTD also requires this with code marked __xipram for the
    same reason.
    
    This of course reduces the space available for kernel modules from
    16MB to either 14MB or 12MB depending on the size of the resulting
    kernel but that shouldn't be a real issue at all, given that the
    whole purpose behind XIP is to execute as much stuff from flash,
    which is better achieved by compiling drivers in the kernel directly.

    [ARM PATCH] 2154/2: XIP kernel for ARM
    
    Patch from Nicolas Pitre
    
    This patch allows for the kernel to be configured for XIP.
    A lot of people are using semi hacked up XIP patches already so
    it is a good idea to have a generic and clean implementation
    supporting all ARM targets. The patch isn't too intrusive.
    
    It involves:
    
    - modifying the kernel entry code to map separate .text and .data
      sections in the initial page table, as well as relocating
      .data to ram when needed
    
    - modifying the linker script to account for the different VMA and
      LMA for .data, as well as making sure that .init.data gets
      relocated to ram
    
    - adding the final kernel mapping with a new MT_ROM mem type
    
    - distinguishing between XIP and non-XIP for bootmem and memory
      resource declaration
    
    - and adding proper target handling to Makefiles.
    
    While at it, this also cleans up the kernel boot code a bit
    so the kernel can now be compiled for any address in ram,
    removing the need for a relation between kernel address and
    start of ram.  Also throws in some more comments.
    
    And finally the _text, _etext, _end and similar variables are now
    declared extern void instead of extern char, or even extern int.
    That allows for operations on their address directly without any
    cast, and trying to reference them by mistake would yield an
    error which is a good thing.
    
    Tested both configurations: XIP and non XIP, the later
    producing a kernel for execution from ram just as before.

         You are absolutely correct. That notice slipped by us and should not be in

    [PKT_SCHED]: Unline inner qdiscs immediately in qdisc_destroy()
    
    Before the RCU change distruction of the qdisc and all inner
    qdiscs happend immediately and under the rtnl semaphore. This
    made sure nothing holding the rtnl semaphore could end up with
    invalid memory. This is not true anymore, inner qdiscs found on
    dev->qdisc_list can be suddenly destroyed by the RCU callback.
    nothing can find them until they get destroyed.
    
    This also makes semantics sane again, an inner qdiscs should not
    be user-visible once the containing qdisc has been destroyed. The
    second part (locking in qdisc_lookup) is not really required, but
    currently the only purpose of qdisc_tree_lock seems to be to protect
    dev->qdisc_list, which is also protected by the rtnl. The rtnl is
    especially relied on for making sure nobody frees a qdisc while it
    is used in user-context, so qdisc_tree_lock looks unnecessary. I'm
    currently reviewing all qdisc locking, if this turns out to be right
    I will remove qdisc_tree_lock entirely in a follow-up patch, but for
    now I left it in for consistency.

    [NETFILTER]: Fix find_appropriate_src() to actually work.
    
    We try to bind to the same source port when sending packets from the
    same source IP/source port to the outside world.  Normally, this is
    simple, since we always try to keep the same source port anyway, but
    there are cases where that is not available.
    
    This is a requirement for the Kegel Peer-to-Peer NAT paper:
    
    	http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~dank/peer-nat.html
    
    Unfortunately, our current implementation is useless.  It looks up a
    hash to see if this srcip/srcpt has been used, but instead of
    returning the mapping to use, it simply returns that same srcip/srcpt.
    This is clearly wrong.  As pointed out by Krisztian Kovacs.
    
    Also, we are no longer using the netfilter-special list iterators, so
    we can split src_cmp, in_range and the actual result manipulation for
    much clearer code.

    [PATCH] new Solaris partition ID
    
    Sun tells me:
    
      For many years both Solaris x86 and Linux have used the same fdisk
      partition id of 0x82.  Solaris uses that identifier to allocate disk
      space which is then further subdivided by the Solaris VTOC (Volume
      Table of Contents) and Linux uses that id as the identifier for its
      swap partition.
    
      The new release of Solaris should be out early next year. Solaris
      will begin using a partition id of 0xbf.  We will continue to support
      the older partition id value of 0x82 for compatibility reasons.
    
      Solaris's fdisk program has been enhanced to allow system administrators
      to switch back and forth between the new and old identifier without any
      loss of data.
    
    So, this may be useful to some people a few months from now.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Add HW CPU timebase sync
    
    This implements support for doing a HW synchronization of the CPU
    timebases on SMP G5 machines.
    
     When the proper clock chips are found on i2c, they are used to stop the
    timebase clock source during the synchronization process.  This replaces
    the software sync algorithm we used so far and provides slightly more
    precise results.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix G5 low level i2c code
    
    The code in pmac_low_i2c.c is a low level synchronous version of the i2c keywest
    driver for use by platform code early during boot or during sleep/wakeup cycles
    to communicate with some motherboard chips, typically clock chips.
    It wasn't used on g5 until now, which is good because it wasn't 64 bits clean :)
    
    This patch fixes it, and also remove the use of udelay() since it can be used for
    synchronizing the HW timebase, and so must operate when it's frozen (and our
    implementation of udelay uses that timebase).

    [PATCH] EFI GPT: reduce alternate header probing
    
    EFI partitioning scheme was reading the last reported sector of the
    block device to look for the alternate GPT header, before it had
    confirmed that it should.  This causes problems for devices with the
    following problems:  a) those who misreport their size (typically
    off-by-one), and b) those who fail when asked to read a block
    outside their range.
    
    This patch moves the test for the Protective Master Boot Record (PMBR)
    ahead of the tests for the Primary and Alternate GPT headers.  If the
    PMBR is not valid, the disk is assumed to not be a GPT disk.  This can
    be overridden with the 'gpt' kernel command line option.  If the
    Primary GPT header is not valid, the Alternate GPT header is not
    probed automatically unless the 'gpt' kernel command line option is
    passed.  If the both the PMBR and Primary GPT header are valid, then
    the Alternate GPT header at the end of the disk is probed.
    
    Also re-enables CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION for all architectures.

    [NET]: Lock initializer unifying
    
    From: <tglx@linutronix.de>
    
    To make spinlock/rwlock initialization consistent all over the kernel,
    this patch converts explicit lock-initializers into spin_lock_init() and
    rwlock_init() calls.
    
    Currently, spinlocks and rwlocks are initialized in two different ways:
    
      lock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED
      spin_lock_init(&lock)
    
      rwlock = RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED
      rwlock_init(&rwlock)
    
    this patch converts all explicit lock initializations to
    spin_lock_init() or rwlock_init(). (Besides consistency this also helps
    automatic lock validators and debugging code.)
    
    The conversion was done with a script, it was verified manually and it
    was reviewed, compiled and tested as far as possible on x86, ARM, PPC.
    
    There is no runtime overhead or actual code change resulting out of this
    patch, because spin_lock_init() and rwlock_init() are macros and are
    thus equivalent to the explicit initialization method.
    
    That's the second batch of the unifying patches.

    [ACPI] acpi_pci_irq_enable() now returns 0 on success.
    This bubbles all the way up to pci_enable_device().
    This allows IRQ0 to be used as a legal PCI device IRQ.
    
    The ES7000 uses an interrupt source override to assign pin20 to IRQ0.
    Then platform_rename_gsi assigns pin0 a high-numbered IRQ -- available
    for PCI devices.  But IRQ0 needs to be a legal PCI IRQ in the lookup code
    to make it as far as the re-name code.

    [PATCH] I2C: Check for unregistered adapter in i2c_del_adapter
    
    The patch adds a check at the beginning of i2c_del_adapter in case
    someone attempts to remove an adapter that was never added in the first
    place. This sounds like a good safety, as doing so will lead to an oops
    at the moment. Also, I have a need for it in the latest version of my
    i2c-amd756-s4882 patch. I need to remove the original adapter and
    install the virtual ones instead, but I have no way to know if the
    original adapter was succesfully added beforehand or not.

    [PATCH] rivafb: big-endian IO access fixes
    
    In big endian machines, the read*/write* accessors do a byteswap for an
    inherently little endian PCI bus.  However, rivafb puts the hardwire in big
    endian register access, thus the byteswap is not needed. So for 16- and
    32-bit access, instead of read*/write*, use __raw_read*/__raw_write* for all
    archs.

    [PATCH] minix_clear_inode fix
    
    The patch below fixes two flaws in minix_clear_inode.
    
    The first is that it tests bh which is never initialized.  (&bh is a
    parameter of minix_V1_raw_inode, but that routine can fail and return
    before it has set bh)
    
    The second is that generic_delete_inode() goes BUG() in case inode->i_state
    != I_CLEAR.  Clearly, it is expected that inode->i_sb->s_op->delete_inode
    does a clear_inode() at some point.  But minix_delete_inode() calls
    minix_free_inode() and that routine can print an error and return early,
    before calling clear_inode().

    [PATCH] kprobes: kprobes ported to x86_64
    
    Adopted from i386 architecture.
    
    Kprobes:
    
    Helps developers to trap at almost any kernel code address, specifying a
    handler routine to be invoked when the breakpoint is hit.  Useful for
    analysing the Linux kernel by collecting debugging information
    non-disruptively.  Employs single-stepping out-of-line to avoid probe
    misses on SMP and may be especially useful in aiding debugging elusive
    races and problems on live systems.  More elaborate dynamic tracing tools
    can be built over the kprobes interface.
    
    Sample usage:
    	To place a probe on __blockdev_direct_IO:
    	static int probe_handler(struct kprobe *p, struct pt_regs *)
    	{
    		... whatever ...
    	}
    	struct kprobe kp = {
    		.addr = __blockdev_direct_IO,
    		.pre_handler = probe_handler
    	};
    	register_kprobe(&kp);
    
    Jprobes:
    
    A special kprobe type which can be placed on function entry points, and
    employs a simple mirroring principle to allow seamless access to the
    arguments of a function being probed.  The probe handler routine should
    have the same prototype as the function being probed.
    
    The way it works is that when the probe is hit, the breakpoint handler
    simply irets to the probe handler's rip while retaining register and stack
    state corresponding to the function entry.  After it is done, the probe
    handler calls jprobe_return() which traps again to restore processor state
    and switch back to the probed function.  Linus noted correctly at KS that
    we need to be careful as gcc assumes that the callee owns arguments.  We
    save and restore enough stack bytes to cover argument space.
    
    Sample Usage:
    	static int jip_queue_xmit(struct sk_buff *skb, int ipfragok)
    	{
    		... whatever ...
    		jprobe_return();
    		return 0;
    	}
    
    	struct jprobe jp = {
    		{.addr = (kprobe_opcode_t *) ip_queue_xmit},
    		.entry = (kprobe_opcode_t *) jip_queue_xmit
    	};
    	register_jprobe(&jp);

    [PATCH] kprobes: Minor i386 changes required for porting kprobes to x86_64
    
    - Kprobes structure has been modified to support copying of original
      instruction as required by the architecture.  On x86_64 normal pages we
      get from kmalloc or vmalloc are not executable.  Single-stepping an
      instruction on such a page yields an oops.  So instead of storing the
      instruction copies in their respective kprobe objects, we allocate a
      page, map it executable, and store all the instruction copies there and
      store the pointer of the copied instruction in the specific kprobes
      object.
    
    - jprobe_return_end is moved into inline assembly to avoid compiler
      optimization.
    
    - arch_prepare_kprobe() now returns an integer,since
      arch_prepare_kprobe() might fail on other architectures.
    
    - added arch_remove_kprobe() routine, since other architectures requires
      it.

    [PATCH] fix alt-sysrq deadlock
    
    The sysrq code is taking a spinlock from both interrupt and process context
    in an unsafe and deadlocky manner.
    
    Move all those inlined functions out of sysrq.h, into sysrq.c then withdraw
    all those exported-to-modules helper functions then remove
    __sysrq_trylock_table() altogether and then use spin_lock_irqsave() in the
    appropriate places.

    [PATCH] VIA8231 support for parallel port driver
    
    This patch allows the kernel to configure port's mode without help of BIOS.
     It is needed on my machine because its firmware simply ignores the
    parallel port leaving in unidirectional SPP mode.
    
    Notes on usage:
    
    To configure the port you need to:
    
    - if parport_pc driver is compiled as a module: specify parport_pc
      init_mode=[spp|ps2|epp|ecp|ecpepp] in /etc/modules file (for Debian
      Linux).
    
    - if the driver is linked statically with the kernel: specify
      parport_init_mode=[spp|ps2|epp|ecp|ecpepp] in kernel's arguments.
    
    This patch is intended for use primarily on Pegasos machines but it will
    work on any computer with VIA8231 south bridge.  In this case it will
    override BIOS setting if you tell the driver to configure the port.  BIOS
    setting will be honored if you omit init_mode parameter.  Technical
    details:
    
    1.  On Pegasos standard port settings (set by OpenFirmware) are: IRQ=7,
        DMA=3, base address=0x3BC, mode is unidirectional SPP.
    
    2.  The patch changes only port mode, all other settings are preserved.
         So if you have a PC with VIA8231 and use driver to configure the port
        you'll still be able to change IRQ, DMA and base address in BIOS and
        these settings will be kept.
    
    3.  One exclusion: if you tell the driver to turn on EPP mode (specify
        epp or ecpepp value) and if default base address is 0x3BC (this is the
        case on Pegasos) the port will be moved to 0x378.  EPP port can't have
        0x3BC as the base.
    
    Known problems:
    
    1.  ECP+EPP mode is strange, it doesn't work even on several PC's i
        tested with Linux.  ECP mode is detected and EPP is not.  So if you get
        the same thing, it's not my fault.  I just have no time to deal with
        it, current result is enough for me.
    
    2.  Not all devices work on Pegasos, i tried my Genuis-HR6 parallel
        port scanner and parallel ZIP drive and both of them don't work.  ZIP
        drive is detected properly but then suddenly gets offline.  Scanner
        does not answer any command at all.  Without the patch the same thing
        happens.  Obviously Pegasos has some more problems which are not
        discovered and not fixed yet.

    [PATCH] Don't ignore try_stop_module return
    
    Since 2.6.4 we've been ignoring the failure of try_stop_module: it will
    normally fail if the module reference count is non-zero.  This would have
    been mainly unnoticed, since "modprobe -r" checks the usage count before
    calling sys_delete_module(), however there is a race which would cause a
    hang in this case.

    [PATCH] fbcon: Another fix for fbcon generic blanking code
    
    If the driver has no fb_blank hook, then the generic method is to clear the
    screen and then disallow writes to the framebuffer.  However, if the
    console is leaving graphics mode (KD_GRAPHICS), it would update the screen
    first, then unblank.  However, since writes to the framebuffers are
    disallowed, the update failes, and upon unblank, the screen is left empty
    except for the flashing cursor.  (This happens, for example when switching
    from X to console).
    
    The fix is to allow writes to the framebuffer even if the console is
    blanked.  To imitate a blank screen, the get_color() function will return
    the attributes of the erase character (black on black) if the console is
    blanked and if the driver has no fb_blank hook.
    
    I think this fixes the rest of the major bugs in the blanking code.

    [PATCH] fbcon: "Do not touch hardware if vc_mode != KD_TEXT: fix
    
    Sigh, this patch uncovered a can of worms.  I tested different combinations,
    those with/without xxxfb_blank implementation, framebuffers in directcolor
    or truecolor, etc. I find that there is a problem unblanking if the hardware
    has no xxxfb_blank() implementation, and also that the generic fb_blank() in
    fbmem.c is problematic with drivers in directcolor or pseudocolor mode when
    called by an fb application such as X.
    
    Display blanking is implemented in three ways:
    
        1. using the drivers blanking implementation - info->fbops->fb_blank()
        2. clearing the screen with the console erase character - fbcon_blank()
        3. setting the color map to all black - fb_blank()
    
    The third method is problematic for these reasons:
    
        - Setting the colormap to all black will not work in truecolor mode
        - In directcolor or pseudocolor, it will overwrite the fb application's
          color map, producing wrong colors.
    
    So, remove the generic implementation in fb_blank() and just return -EINVAL
    if there is no hardware implementation.  This will be only used by apps doing
    an FBIO_BLANK ioctl, and is a more robust approach.
    
    Other changes:
    
    - Consolidated all tests and created an inlined helper function to check if
      the framebuffer console is inactive or not.
    - fix unblanking if driver has no xxxfb_blank() hook.
    
    I'm probably missing a few more things, but this patch should be generally
    correct. Please apply after the entire patch series to avoid rejects.

    helper modules and don't work together with tvaudio, so keep it away

    [PATCH] uml: clear singlestep
    
    The patch syscall-security-3 is wrong (provided by me, sorry).  I missed,
    that singlestepping_skas() used to reset PT_DTRACE.  This was handled
    differently in tt and skas.  With syscall-security-3 applied, a process in
    SKAS that singlestepped once continues to singlestep until the next
    systemcall occurs, even if it is resumed with PTRACE_CONT or
    PTRACE_SYSCALL.
    
    This fix unifies the usage of PT_DTRACE in TT and SKAS.  PT_DTRACE now is
    set by ptrace(PTRACE_SINGLESTEP,...) and reset by singlestepping() and it
    is evaluated in kern_do_signal().

    [PATCH] uml: re-add linux Makefile target - fixes to the old version.
    
    We have re-added the "linux" target which just creates a hardlink to vmlinux.
    It was noted (sorry for forgetting who said this) that "make ARCH=um" will
    leave an old "linux" file, since the target is not listed in .PHONY.
    
    Using a symlink, instead of an hard link, was suggested because the hard link
    does not get updated with make vmlinux.  But mv linux $destpath (the most
    meaningful installation command) is broken, so I instead added linux to
    .PHONY.  Obviously, linux will not be rebuilt on "make vmlinux ARCH=um", but
    this makes sense (if people use the new way, don't use old tricks).  Anyway,
    we remove "linux" in any case.

    The port channel now sets SO_REUSEADDR.
    
    Added some initcall and exitcall definitions to arch/um/include/init.h
    so that they can be used from userspace code.
    
    Fixed the error handling in run_helper.
    
    Added the log() facility to mem_user.c.
    
    Fixed a problem with recursive segfaults not being handled correctly.
    
    tty_log_fd and umid aren't added to the command line any more.
    
    Fixed some prints.

    [PATCH] uml: use PTRACE_SYSEMU also for TT mode
    
    From: Jeff Dike <jdike@addtoit.com>
          Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso<blaisorblade_spam@yahoo.it>
    
    As Jeff Dike noted, even if SYSEMU was originally written for use in SKAS
    mode, there is nothing SKAS specific in SYSEMU, so use it for TT mode, too.
    
    SYSEMU simply allows one to ptrace(PTRACE_SYSEMU) a process, that will stop
    on the syscall entry path like with PTRACE_SYSCALL, but with the difference
    that it makes sure that the syscall execution is totally skipped and that
    the child will see the return value set by the ptracer when the child was
    stopped.
    
    We even hope that the SYSEMU patch can be merged in mainline sooner than
    SKAS.

    [PATCH] uml: more careful test startup
    
    From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade_spam@yahoo.it>
          Bodo Stroesser <bodo.stroesser@fujitsu-siemens.com>
    
    While testing the host ptrace(2) features, we modify the stack frame of a test
    child which is doing a syscall (namely getpid).  Either we override the
    syscall number or the return value, which become the parent's pid, or we
    don't, and the return value is the child's pid.
    
    Actually, we only compared the return value with the child's pid, so we did
    not notice a bug where the return value happened to be different from both.
    So I added a stricter test here.

    [PATCH] uml: fix sysemu test at startup
    
    From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade_spam@yahoo.it>
          Bodo Stroesser <bodo.stroesser@fujitsu-siemens.com>
          Jeff Dike <jdike@addtoit.com>
    
    Currently, the test for the SYSEMU support on the host is completely wrong, as
    Bodo noticed.  We should change the syscall result (inserting the host pid)
    and check if it is received correctly by the guest.  What we actually do,
    without this patch, is to overwrite the syscall number.
    
    This went unnoticed because we only check that the getpid() syscall from the
    child does not return its pid.  We don't check that it returns the correct
    value.
    
    Also, override the result portably, using the PT_SYSCALL_RET_OFFSET macro
    which abstract away the host stack frame layout (took from Jeff Dike code).

    [PATCH] uml: use kallsyms when dumping stack
    
    This patch makes UML use print_symbol() when dumping the stack.  It is not yet
    complete (the i386 version uses the frame pointers to walk the stack, for
    instance), but should be at least enough.
    
    Also, it uses bust_spinlock() when dumping errors to help them reach the
    console.  This appears not to be enough - however I analyzed the UML console
    code, and it seems that UML console don't get flushed *at all* when exiting.

    change_signals; since get/set_signals don't enable/disable SIGPROF (and this
    behaviour is safe as explained in the comment the patch adds, since the
    profiling code does not interact with the kernel code), not even
    change_signals must toggle it.

    This is a rewrite of the mconsole_proc function.

    causes the problem, I guess trying to access the procfs without actually
    mounting it somewhere causes some corruption of kernel data structures.
    
    The new code simply openes /proc/<file> via sys_open().  That simplifies the
    function alot.  It also doesn't crash any more ;)
    
    Also, from Paolo Giarrusso: When printing the content of a file through the
    "proc" command, make it begin on his own line.
    
    PROBLEMS:
    
    Drawback is that it only works when procfs is actually mounted below /proc.
    And within UML, often this is false, because when building honeypots we mount
    HPPFS under /proc to avoid the hacker recognizing he's attacking a UML
    instance.
    
    One suggestion I've received to fix the later issue was to mount the procfs
    within a kernel thread with a private namespace, but I havn't tried that so
    far.
    
    Instead, we'd like to fix the actual code of the mconsole_proc function.  From
    "Anthony Brock" Anthony_Brock (at) ous (dot) edu comes a comment, suggesting
    where the bug lays (as noted in the source): removing part of the code (it
    seems the symlink lookup) there are no more crashes.

    [PATCH] uml: no duplicate current_thread definition
    
    From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade_spam@yahoo.it>
          Jeff Dike <jdike@addtoit.com>
    
    Currently there are two distinct definitions of current_thread_info (which has
    its usual meaning) and current_thread (which is the same thing); so define the
    second to be the first (for UML compatibility).  If needed, a search & replace
    \<current_thread\> to current_thread_info and removing current_thread can be
    done (that would be a separate, low-priority patch, however).
    
    Also, since the involved headers include each other very deeply, we must fix
    somehow this recursive inclusion or things won't compile.
    
    Jeff Dike noted that this can be done easily, since the nasty chain of
    includes can be broken by eliminating an include of current.h, and implemented
    this.

    [PATCH] uml: fix symbol conflict in linking
    
    Since arch/um/kernel/tt/unmap_fin.o is linked statically, it could contain
    some symbols also contained in the rest of vmlinux; on some systems, this
    actually happens (due to some glibc differences).
    
    Since that file *must* be linked statically and then relinked (its code must
    remap the whole .text area except the section it is contained in during UML
    startup), we cannot change this.  So, we use objcopy to turn all symbols into
    local ones except for switcheroo(), which is the only function actually
    defined in the source (the other ones are brought in during linking).
    
    This shouldn't hurt other systems, while improving the behaviour on affected
    ones (there is still another issue I'm trying to fix).  And it is logically
    always needed (i.e., without this UML has just happened to work until now).

    [PATCH] uml: fix ptrace() hang on 2.6.9 host due to host changes
    
    From: Gerd Knorr <kraxel@bytesex.org>,
          Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade_spam@yahoo.it>
    
    Uml was using kill(pid, SIGKILL) instead of ptrace(PTRACE_KILL, pid), which
    used to work, while being probably undocumented.  Due to the changes in
    2.6.9 to the ptrace(2) semantics, with the introduction of TASK_TRACED by
    Roland McGrath, this does not more work, so this patch should fix it.
    
    With help of Gerd Knorr report and analysis, and its early fix of this
    problem.  He fixed the problem by sending SIGCONT to the child processes
    after SIGKILL.  Which IMHO should not be needed (I think this is a
    regression, which he already reported).
    
    I improved his one, by replacing the SIGCONT hack with using PTRACE_KILL
    instead.

    - mmtimer: add support for the use of hardware timers on SGI SHubs (sn

    - Allows the scheduling of up to 3 hardware interrupts per node to
      deliver signals to processes running on those nodes.
    
    - Periodic timers in user space capable of supporting intervals down to
      10us (<10us supported but will usually result in excessive overruns).
    
    - Scheduling accuracy of 40ns.  (However, typically it takes at least a
      few usecs for an interrupt to be forwarded to a signal in user space.)
    
    - Add missing SHub information to include/asm-ia64/sn/shub_mmr.h
    
    - Reserve timer interrupt used in include/asm-ia64/sn/intr.h

    [PATCH] ptrace POKEUSR: add comment about the DR7 check.
    
    The DR7 register on i386/x86_64 has a special meaning, so there is a
    special check to do.  Since the code is rather difficult, I added an
    explaination about it.  Also, while studying the i386 Intel Manual, I saw
    that x86_64, even on 32bit emulation, allows using values which are
    disallowed on i386.  It's almost obvious that what it allows is setting a
    8-byte wide data watchpoint (in fact I double checked the AMD manuals, just
    in case, and this is true; I couldn't find a mention of this in my Intel
    manuals).
    
    But since the original ia32 emulation code has this comment:
    
    	/* You are not expected to understand this ... I don't neither. */
    
    I am dubious that the code in ptrace32.c is wrong: does x86_64 supports
    8byte-wide watchpoints in 32-bit emulation?  I've checked the AMD manual
    Vol.  2 (no.  24593), which says that to set the length to 8 bits "long
    mode must be enabled".  This means, actually, that the current code is
    safe, notwithstanding the comment (which I removed).

    [PATCH] x86, x86_64: Only handle system NMIs on the BSP
    
     While discussing races in the NMI handler's trailer fiddling with RTC
    registers, I've discovered we incorrectly attempt to handle NMIs coming
    from the system (memory errors, IOCHK# assertions, etc.) with all
    processors even though the interrupts are only routed to the bootstrap
    processor.  If one of these events coincides with a NMI watchdog tick it
    may even be handled multiple times in parallel.
    
    Here is a fix that makes application processors ignore these events.  They
    no longer access the NMI status bits at I/O port 0x61 which has also the
    advantage of removing the contention on the port when the I/O APIC NMI
    watchdog makes all processors arrive at the handler at the same time.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Add option for oprofile to backtrace through spinlocks
    
    Now that spinlocks are always out of line, oprofile needs to backtrace
    through them.  The following patch adds this but also adds the ability to
    turn it off (via the backtrace_spinlocks option in oprofilefs).
    
    The backout option is included because the backtracing here is best effort.
     On ppc64 the performance monitor exception is not an NMI, we get them only
    when interrupts are enabled.  This means we can receive a profile hit that
    is inside a spinlock when our PC is somewhere completely
    
    In this patch we check to make sure the PC of the performance monitor
    exception as well as the current PC is inside the spinlock region.  If so
    then we find the callers PC.  If this is not true we play it safe and leave
    the tick inside the lock region.
    
    Also, now that we execute the SLB handler in real mode we have to adjust
    the address range that we consider as valid real mode addresses.  Otherwise
    the SLB miss handler will end up as unknown kernel profile hits.

    [PATCH] ppc64: VIO iommu table property parsing wrong
    
    With current firmware, the ibm,my-dma-window property now contains two
    panes for VSCSI server nodes.  This breaks the current tests in the setup
    code.
    
    There's a bunch of references to pre-GA firmware bugs.  That's a while ago,
    so we can remove the workarounds without breaking anyone.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Fixup <asm/time.h> includes
    
    include/asm-ppc/time.h has a slightly odd include list which means that
    some files include <asm/time.h> and also hope to get others that they
    really shouldn't be.  This makes <asm/time.h> use <linux/types.h> (time_t)
    and <linux/rtc.h> (struct rtc_time) instead of <linux/mc16818rtc.h>, and
    fixes up the fallout from the change.

    [PATCH] Fix pmac_zilog as console
    
    pmac_zilog wasn't properly updating port->timeout, thus broke with serial
    console.  I'm not sure if that timeout thing was added recently or not,
    since the driver used to work fine.  This patch fixes that, and adds some
    proper SYSRQ support.  By default, BREAK is used for sysrq, though some
    Apple zilog's seem to have non-working BREAK detection logic, thus the
    driver has a #define option you can manually enable when debugging to do
    SYSRQ with ctrl-O instead (like pSeries virtual consoles).

    [PATCH] ppc32: CPM2 bug
    
    Rune has determined that:
    res6 should be 94 bytes long.
    
    However... It does work @ 92 bytes because the compiler alligns the next
    struct (pci_cpm2_t) on a int boundary anyways (no packing specified fo
    the structs)
    
    I tested it with a module that pronted out the address of the PCI struct
    that follows the sit_cpm2_t struct.
    
    Imap = 0xF0000000
    With res6[92]
    im-pci is @  0xf0010430
    
    With res6[94]
    im-pci is @  0xf0010430
    
    So we're saved by the compiler.

    [PATCH] more hardirq.h consolidation
    
    PREEMPT_BITS, SOFTIRQ_BITS, PREEMPT_SHIFT, SOFTIRQ_SHIFT and HARDIRQ_SHIFT
    are the same for all architectures (and chaning them in future ports
    doesn't make a lot of sense), so move them to <linux/hardirq.h>.
    
    Make the HARDIRQ_BITS definition guarded by #ifndef HARDIRQ_BITS instead of
    CONFIG_GENERIC_HARDIRQS so we have a saner way to override it once ports
    with lots of irq sources are changed to use the generic hardirq framework.
    
    Ingo, maybe we should change the default for it back to 8 as that's what
    most ports use?

    [PATCH] fix find_next_best_node()
    
    If NUMA is enabled, find_next_best_node is responsible for helping build
    the zonelist for each pgdat in the system.  However, if one sets
    PENALTY_FOR_NODE_WITH_CPUS to a large value in an attempt to prefer nodes
    w/o CPUs, the local node is erroneously placed after all nodes w/o CPUs in
    the pgdat's zonelist.  This small patch fixes that by just checking if the
    local node is part of the zonelist yet, and if not, returns it first.

    [PATCH] prio_tree: fix prio_tree_expand corner case
    
    Currently we use prio_tree_root->index_bits to optimize the height of both
    the initial heap-and-radix indexed levels of a prio_tree as well as the
    heap-and-size indexed overflow-sub-trees.  Please see the accompanying
    prio_tree documentation patch for further details.
    
    When index_bits is increased in prio_tree_expand we shuffle the initial
    heap-and-radix indexed levels to make sure that vmas are placed in the tree
    at appropriate places.  Similarly, since the overflow-sub-trees' heights
    also depend on prio_tree_root->index_bits we should shuffle all the
    overflow-sub-trees when index_bits changes.  However, I missed to take care
    of this in my implementation.
    
    Recently Stefan Hornburg (Racke) reported the problem and patiently tested
    the trace patches.  Hugh Dickins produced the trace patches that helped to
    detect the bug.  Moreover, Hugh reduced the crash test case to few lines of
    code.  Thanks to both of them.
    
    The easy fix is to disable prio_tree_expand code completely.  That may lead
    to skewed trees in some common cases.  Hence, this patch takes a different
    approach.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by not optimizing the height of the
    overflow-sub-trees using prio_tree_root->index_bits.  Now all
    overflow-sub-trees use full BITS_PER_LONG bits of size_index to place the
    vmas (that have the same start_vm_pgoff) in an overflow-sub-tree.
    
    This may result in skewed overflow-sub-trees because all bits in vm_pgoff
    above prio_tree_root->index_bits will be 0 (zero).  However, processes
    rarely map many vmas with the same start_vm_pgoff and different
    end_vm_pgoff.  Therefore, such skewed sub-trees should be very rare.

    [PATCH] bootmem use NODE_DATA
    
    Whilst looking at simplifying the implmentation of i386 initialisation code
    I noticed the following.  This change allows these routines to be used in
    both node based and flat memory models which allows more of the init code
    to be common in these models.
    
    Convert the default non-node based bootmem routines to use NODE_DATA(0).
    This is semantically and functionally identical in any non-node
    configuration as NODE_DATA(x) is defined as below.
    
    #define NODE_DATA(nid)          (&contig_page_data)
    
    For the node cases (CONFIG_NUMA and CONFIG_DISCONTIG_MEM) we can use these
    non-node forms where all boot memory is defined on node 0.

    pc110 touchpad driver: be more polite
    
    The PC110 touchpad driver used to just assume that the hardware
    exists, even though in fact the hw is extremely rare indeed, and
    just requesting all the resources might stomp on some _other_
    hardware.
    
    Try to minimize the damage by realizing that the touchpad hw only
    exists on old ISA-only hardware, and if we have found a PCI device,
    we should not try to load the touchpad driver.

    [PATCH] make cdu31a work on at least one system
    
    I've got a Sony CDU33A drive with COR334 controller.  The Linux cdu31a
    driver was not updated for 2.6 kernel so it does not work.
    
    Here are patches that try to make the driver working with 2.6
    kernel:
      - fix the timeout values in header file
      - Make the driver work in 2.6.X
      - Added workaround to fix hard lockups on eject
      - Fixed door locking problem after mounting empty drive
      - Set double-speed drives to double speed by default

    It does work on my system. I also know that it's still broken - it uses
    cli(), MODULE_PARM and it's also not very fast (I _never_ reached full
    300KB/s with it, but I know that it's possible in Windows) and probably
    many other things (I'm new to Linux kernel) - so I'm waiting for comments.

    [Bluetooth] Support responses with zero SCID
    
    According to the Bluetooth specification there is no need to fill in
    the SCID on a failing response. Without a SCID the L2CAP core can't
    find the corresponding request for it. In the case of the zero SCID
    the signal identifier should be used to match the response to its
    request.

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20041105 from Bob Moore
    
    Implemented support for FADT revision 2.  This was an
    interim table (between ACPI 1.0 and ACPI 2.0) that adds
    support for the FADT reset register.
    
    Implemented optional support to allow uninitialized LocalX
    and ArgX variables in a control method.  The variables
    are initialized to an Integer object with a value
    of zero.  This support is enabled by setting the
    acpi_gbl_enable_interpreter_slack flag to TRUE,
    which is default unless booted with "acpi=strict".
    
    Implemented support for Integer objects for the SizeOf
    operator.  Either 4 or 8 is returned, depending on the
    current integer size (32-bit or 64-bit, depending on the
    parent table revision).
    
    Fixed a problem in the implementation of the SizeOf and
    ObjectType operators where the operand was resolved to
    a value too early, causing incorrect return values for
    some objects.
    
    Fixed some possible memory leaks during exceptional conditions.

    NTFS: Rewrite handling of multi sector transfer errors.  We now do not set
          PageError() when such errors are detected in the async i/o handler           fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_end_buffer_async_read().  All users of mst           protected attributes now check the magic of each ntfs record as they           use it and act appropriately.  This has the effect of making errors
          granular per ntfs record rather than per page which solves the case
          where we cannot access any of the ntfs records in a page when a
          single one of them had an mst error.  (Thanks to Ken MacFerrin for
          the bug report.)

    [ide] siimage: fix the various SI3112 hangs
    
    From: Alan Cox <alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk>
    (some changes by me - bart)
    
    The current driver looks at fields before it is safe to, we move the
    mod15rm bug handler to be a fixup and this ensures the probe has been
    completed before we use the ident data.

    [ide] apply undecoded slave fixup only for ide-cs
    
    From: Alan Cox <alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk>
    (some changes by me - bart)
    
    We add probe_hwif_init_with_fixup (seperate naming as requested by
    Bartlomiej). This runs a fixup on present interfaces before attaching
    the drives. In order to be useful we need also an _with_fixup version
    of ide_register_hw function.
    
    The sometimes troublesome undecoded slave detector is moved to its own
    function and exported so that ide-cs and the upcoming delkin_cb can both
    use it (along with any arch specific cf/pcmcia drivers I don't know
    about). The non-relevant checks for this scenario are removed.

    [PATCH] PCI: add PCI ROMs to sysfs
    
    Linus has requested that the sysfs rom attribute be changed to require
    enabling before it works. echo "0" to the attribute to disable,
    echoing anything else enables the rom output. The concern is that
    something like a file browser could inadvertently read the attribute
    and change the state of the hardware without the user's knowledge.
    
    The attached patch includes the previous patch plus the enabling logic.

    [PATCH] Lock initializer unifying Batch 2 (PCI)
    
    To make spinlock/rwlock initialization consistent all over the kernel,
    this patch converts explicit lock-initializers into spin_lock_init() and
    rwlock_init() calls.
    
    Currently, spinlocks and rwlocks are initialized in two different ways:
    
      lock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED
      spin_lock_init(&lock)
    
      rwlock = RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED
      rwlock_init(&rwlock)
    
    this patch converts all explicit lock initializations to
    spin_lock_init() or rwlock_init(). (Besides consistency this also helps
    automatic lock validators and debugging code.)
    
    The conversion was done with a script, it was verified manually and it
    was reviewed, compiled and tested as far as possible on x86, ARM, PPC.
    
    There is no runtime overhead or actual code change resulting out of this
    patch, because spin_lock_init() and rwlock_init() are macros and are
    thus equivalent to the explicit initialization method.
    
    That's the second batch of the unifying patches.

    [PATCH] I2C: New PC8736x chip driver
    
    This is my port of the pc87360 driver. It supports the hardware
    monitoring functions of the National Semiconductor PC8736x Super-I/O
    family. The PC87360, PC87363 and PC87364 only do fan monitoring and
    control. The PC87365 and PC87366 additionally have voltage and
    temperature monitoring.
    
    The driver was ported upon request from Wincor-Nixdorf, and tested by
    Rolf Müller there. I wish to thank Rolf for his very efficient
    cooperation.
    
    Please apply,
    thanks.

    [PATCH] I2C: New LM63 chip driver
    
    This is a new I2C chip driver named lm63, which supports National
    Semiconductor's LM63 hardware monitoring chip. The LM63 is similar to
    the LM86 (which we do support through our lm90 driver) with additional
    monitoring and control of a single fan. It is obviously aimed at the CPU
    and high-end graphics adapters markets. This new driver is very similar
    in nature to the lm83 and lm90 driver so I don't have much to add.
    
    I developed the driver on a request from Hard Data Ltd. which are using
    Tyan S4882 boards where four LM63 chips are used (one for each CPU).
    Tyan provided remote access to a test system so that I could test my
    driver on real LM63 chips.

    There is a similar problem reported by s390 people where we see parent
    kobject (directory) going away before child kobject (sub-directory). It
    seems kobject code is able to handle this, but not the sysfs. What could
    be happening that in sysfs_remove_dir() of parent directory, we try to
    remove its contents. It works well with the regular files as it is the
    final removal for sysfs_dirent corresponding to the files. But in case
    of sub-directory we are doing an extra sysfs_put().  Once while removing
    parent and the other one being the one from when sysfs_remove_dir() is
    called for the child.
    
    The following patch worked for the s390 people, I hope same will work in
    this case also.
    
    
    o Do not remove sysfs_dirents corresponding to the sub-directory in
      sysfs_remove_dir(). They will be removed in the sysfs_remove_dir() call
      for the specific sub-directory.

    Make "unlock_buffer()" use the optimized "smp_mb__after_clear_bit()".
    
    "clear_buffer_locked()" is just a nicer name for a clear-bit, and
    on x86 (and others) we don't need any expensive memory barriers
    after that.

    [PATCH] USB: Patch for ub
    
    This is a relatively small changeset, to address small nagging problems.
    Andrew pointed me at the double registration specifically, so I had to do
    something about it. At least now Fabio's box won't collapse if he configures
    UB by mistake. Also, a few people complained that the help text was
    misleading.
    
    I have not done anything about the oops on disconnect which happens to
    Martin Schlemmer. It's next. After that I can get to Peter Jones' CD
    burning patch and doing resets.
    
    - Fix double kobject registration and eventual oops on unplug if a device
      is not cooperating.
    - Add a reference to usb-storage into the configuration help.
    - Just upping timeouts fixes my ZIP drive.
    - Max out the diag (trace) file size.
    - Set capacity to zero in case the media is absent. It works in 2.4.10-rc1.
      Either Al fixed the block layer, or the whole thing was a bug in ub.c
      (and sd.c) and a big misunderstanding.

    [PATCH] kobject_uevent: fix init ordering
    
    Looks like kobject_uevent_init is executed before netlink_proto_init and
    consequently always fails.  Not cool.
    
    Attached patch switches the initialization over from core_initcall (init
    level 1) to postcore_initcall (init level 2).  Netlink's initialization
    is done in core_initcall, so this should fix the problem.  We should be
    fine waiting until postcore_initcall.
    
    Also a couple white space changes mixed in, because I am anal.

    System calls still use the stack.

     df_02_bus_rescan_devcies_fix.patch
    
     bus_rescan_devices() eventually calls device_attach() and thus

    called bus_for_each_dev() which only read locks the bus.  This patch
    separates __bus_for_each_dev() and __bus_for_each_drv(), which don't
    do locking themselves, out from the original functions and call them
    with read lock in the original functions and with write lock in
    bus_rescan_devices().

    [PATCH] add the physical device and the bus to the hotplug environment
    
    Add the sysfs path of the physical device to the hotplug event of class
    and block devices. This should solve the userspace issue not to know if
    the device is a virtual one and the "device" symlink will never be created,
    but we sit there and wait for it to show up not knowing when we should
    give up.
    
    Also the bus name is added to the hotplug event, so we don't need to
    reverse lookup in the /sys/bus/* directory which bus our physical
    device belongs to. This is e.g. the value matched against the BUS= key,
    that may be used in an udev rule.

    Just had a case with a gdth adapter not working in a 16GB box. Seems to
    me that the SCSI bounce decision is completely screwy - it returns the
    device dma mask, if it is set only and the box doesn't have an iommu. So
    if we can't get the mask, we allow any io. Not so good. I think the
    logic should be more as follows:
    
    	if (isa)
    		return bounce_above_isa;
    	if (has_iommu)
    		return bounce_nothing;
    
    	if (we_know_device_dma_mask)
    		return mask;
    	else
    		return default_to_32bit;
    
    Patch corrects scsi_calculate_bounce_limit() to actually work partly
    sanely.

    [PATCH] avoid semi-infinite loop when mounting bad ext2
    
    The routine ext2_readdir() will, when reading a directory page
    returns an error, try the next page, without reporting the
    error to user space. That is bad, and the patch below changes that.
    
    In my case the filesystem was damaged, and ext2_readdir wanted
    to read 60000+ pages and wrote as many error messages to syslog
    ("attempt to access beyond end"), not what one wants.
    
    [no doubt a similar patch is appropriate for ext3]

    [PATCH] USB: add KC2190 support for usbnet.
    
    The patch below adds support for the KC2190 usb-to-usb networking

    Bus 001 Device 003: ID 050f:0190 KC Technology, Inc.
    
    I was under the impression that support for this had been added a long
    time ago, but searching through old kernel versions all I could find was
    a comment about the chip, with no support. Patch is against 2.6.9 but is
    pretty minimal.
    
    I don't have a Windows box around to test interoperability with that
    driver, but the patch appears to make it work perfectly between 2 Linux
    boxes.

    [PATCH] USB: usb gadget serial driver v2.0
    
    This patch updates the serial gadget driver:
    
     - The bulk is Al Borcher's version 2.0 updates:
    
         * Use the new utilities to build config descriptors from tables.
    
         * Add CDC ACM support, which brings lots of goodness including
           interop with Windows.
    
         * Work better given PXA 25x hardware automagic.
    
     - I have a few minor tweaks.
    
         * Match the recent tty API change:  from_user is gone!!
    
         * Define new product ID for the CDC ACM version, so Windows
           registry won't get confused by the non-ACM version.
    
         * Add OTG descriptor
    
         * Allocates packet buffers more efficiently on platforms like
           OMAP: use kmalloc not the dma-coherent allocator.
    
    Al has some docs on how to talk to Windows this, including an INF file.

    [PATCH] USB: ohci, hooks for big-endian registers
    
    This is the second of the patches from Dale Farnsworth to
    support OHCI implementations that use big-endian byte sex
    for registers ... all register accesses changed, that's why
    it's so large.  (It also includes part of an update from
    his third patch, so that it compiles/runs by itself.)
    
    This patch adds support to the OHCI code for big-endian controllers,
    maintaining the existing little-endian support.  This is done using
    the following transforms:
    
            ohci_readl(p)   --> ohci_readl(ohci, p)
    	writel(v, p)    --> ohci_writel(ohci, v, p)
    
    	cpu_to_le16(v)  --> cpu_to_hc16(ohci, v)
    	cpu_to_le16p(v) --> cpu_to_hc16p(ohci, v)
    	cpu_to_le32(v)  --> cpu_to_hc32(ohci, v)
    	cpu_to_le32p(v) --> cpu_to_hc32p(ohci, v)
    
    	le16_to_cpu(v) --> hc16_to_cpu(ohci, v)
    	le16_to_cpup(v) --> hc16_to_cpup(ohci, v)
    	le32_to_cpu(v) --> hc32_to_cpu(ohci, v)
    	le32_to_cpup(v) --> hc32_to_cpup(ohci, v)
    
    	OHCI_FRAME_NO(ohci->hcca) --> ohci_frame_no(ohci)
    
    There's no runtime penalty except for systems configured to handle
    both byteorders at the same time.

    [PATCH] usbcore: Make the core release hcd structures
    
    This patch contains changes to usbcore making the core responsible for
    deallocating memory for usb_hcd structures, rather than calling back into
    the host controller drivers.  This solves a long-standing oops, since the
    drivers may have been unloaded from memory by the time the release routine
    is called.  (There probably are some Bugzilla entries caused by this, but
    I don't know which ones.)
    
    To really fix this up properly will require merging the HCD "glue" layer
    into the higher core structures.  As things stand now, a usb_hcd contains
    a usb_bus member, and the usb_bus is associated with a class_device: when
    the class_device is released the usb_hcd gets deallocated.  It's awkward
    in that neither the usb_hcd nor the usb_bus has its own reference count,
    and the class_device is created when the bus is registered (not when it is
    initialized).

    the TCP-specific tcpdiag.

    XFree (and X.org) has both always been broken in their conversion of the DPMS
    blanking mode when passing to the kernel ioctl FBIOBLANK (in fbdev mode).
    
    This patch makes sure that at least the value passed by userland stays in the
    legal range, which has the side effect that an X DPMS POWERDOWN request will
    result as an fbdev VESA_POWERDOWN request at the fbdev level now, instead of
    an out-of-range value.

    [PATCH] parisc: fix security hole
    
    The default interruption handler "handle_interruption" does not properly
    check to see if the faulting space is the same as the users space.
    The problem lies in the fact that if a fault happens on the gateway we
    will not deliver signals to the process, the process will not die, and we
    may continue handling the same fault in a loop forever.  Any malicious
    user code can crash the kernel by jumping into the gateway page at an
    inopportune address.
    
    The solution is to check if the user has the right privilege and if the
    spaces match, both faulting and currently active. The best action is to
    force the process back to it's own space of execution at address zero, and
    let it take a SIGSEGV. The process can never recover from this because it
    happens immediately after the return from the interrupt via rfi or rfir.

    [ARM PATCH] 2190/1: S3C2410 - fix compile for S3C2440 CPUs
    
    Patch from Ben Dooks
    
    Fixes mis-labelled timer variables, and incldes the
    clock header to allow the code to compile. This
    was not caught on previous rounds as all the
    s3c2440 machine support is pending the finalisation
    of the new s3c2440 uart driver (arriving soon)

    [ARM PATCH] 2189/1: S3C2410 - select pclk as source for timer if none specified for machine
    
    Patch from Ben Dooks
    
    Select the PCLK based TIMER4 to provide the system timer tick
    if there is no machine specific timer setup specified. This
    should make it easier to add new machines, as well as cut down
    on the code required in time.c when they are added.

    [ARM PATCH] 2188/1: Add missing MODULE_LICENSE declaration in PXA Lubbock PCMCIA driver
    
    Patch from George G. Davis
    
    The Lubbock PCMCIA socket driver, drivers/pcmcia/pxa2xx_lubbock.c,
    lacks a MODULE_LICENSE declaration. This patch merely adds the missing
    MODULE_LICENSE declaration to eliminate tainted kernel warnings when
    this driver is built as a module. I have intentionally not used the
    Dual MPL/GPL license in this case because 1) current linux-2.6.10-rc1
    PXA PCMCIA drivers use only the GPL license, 2) the original source
    files on which the PXA PCMCIA drivers are based, i.e. the SA11xx PCMCIA
    drivers, state: "If you wish to allow the use of your version of this
    file only under the terms of the GPL and not to allow others to use your
    version of this file under the MPL, indicate your decision by deleting
    the provisions above and replace them with the notice and other
    provisions required by the GPL."

    [PATCH] therm_adt746x: gradually change fan speed and start both fans on Albooks
    
    Here's the patch that supercedes the one I asked you to drop.  It changes
    the fan speed logic so that the fans will go incrementally fast instead of
    using just two steps.  Also, it starts and stops both fans instead of just
    one on Powerbooks 15" and 17" (functionality asked by most of the Albooks
    users on Debian's ML, and justified by the fact that fan 1 and fan 2 do not
    correspond to CPU and GPU, as we previously thought).

        - time interpolator registration now done in driver add() path, so we can

    [PATCH] x86-64: fix sibling map again
    
    Recent x86-64 sibling map fix for clustered mode by James
    (http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/cset@414b34a6jkiHQ5AnhA269av76y3ZAw?nav=index.html)
    is not the recommended way of fixing it.
    
    That patch assumes BIOS for non-clustered systems accept the HW assigned
    value.  Why make this assumption when we can fix it in a better
    fashion(which is also used by x86 kernel's today)
    
    Basically use HW assigned apic_id's(returned by cpuid) for non clustered
    systems and for clustered use BIOS provided apic_id's.  Appended patch does
    this.
    
    Note: Similar issue was earlier disussed in context of x86 approx an year
    back and James then backed out his changes.

    [PATCH] ppc32: fix early request_irq
    
    Here's a patch which backs out the fix Randy Vinson came up with, and makes
    i8259_init() and openpic_hookup_cascade() use setup_irq (tested on LoPEC).
    This also converts the rest of the request_irq callers that were expecting the
    old behavior (psurge SMP, chrp xmon, 85xx, some 82xx).  This is more untested,
    but looks correct.  I've left 8xx alone in this as it needs other changes
    before it would make sense.

    patch removes one set of them and adds the proper include file to sn_sal.h.

    [TG3]: Fix fiber hw autoneg bounces
    
    We've recently noticed that the autonegotiation cleanup made a while
    back (between tg3 3.8 and 3.9) has issues which make the link bounce up
    and down.
    
    I've traced it to be caused by the tg3_timer 1 second work noticing that
    MAC_STATUS_LNKSTATE_CHANGED was set, which driver would see as the link
    going down.
    
    Upon further inspection, it appears that we don't wait long enough
    between setting SG_DIG_CTRL and reading the SG_DIG_STATUS for the result.
    
    The following patch (from a quasi recent bk tree) makes this code path
    wait up to 200ms for the link to establish.  In my testing, I'm seeing
    it take around 20ms for the negotiation to complete.
    
    I haven't had the chance to test how this patch affects the case where
    the switch doesn't have autoneg enabled, although I suspect fallback
    should work correctly.
    
    Please consider applying, thanks,

    [PATCH] Lock initializer unifying Batch 2 (USB)
    
    To make spinlock/rwlock initialization consistent all over the kernel,
    this patch converts explicit lock-initializers into spin_lock_init() and
    rwlock_init() calls.
    
    Currently, spinlocks and rwlocks are initialized in two different ways:
    
      lock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED
      spin_lock_init(&lock)
    
      rwlock = RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED
      rwlock_init(&rwlock)
    
    this patch converts all explicit lock initializations to
    spin_lock_init() or rwlock_init(). (Besides consistency this also helps
    automatic lock validators and debugging code.)
    
    The conversion was done with a script, it was verified manually and it
    was reviewed, compiled and tested as far as possible on x86, ARM, PPC.
    
    There is no runtime overhead or actual code change resulting out of this
    patch, because spin_lock_init() and rwlock_init() are macros and are
    thus equivalent to the explicit initialization method.
    
    That's the second batch of the unifying patches.

    [PATCH] USB: Dequeuing of root-hub URBs
    
    This patch fixes a tiny SMP-type hole in root-hub synchronization.
    Although the HCD glue layer properly unlinks root-hub status URBs
    synchronously, it doesn't do so for URBs sent to endpoint 0.  This patch
    copies some code from usb_kill_urb, to make such unlinks wait until the
    host controller driver has finished handling the URB.  This behavior is
    required for hcd_endpoint_disable to work correctly.
    
    The patch also renames usb_rh_status_dequeue to usb_rh_urb_dequeue (to
    better describe its updated function) and declares the routine static.

    [PATCH] EHCI suspend/resume updates
    
    This patch much improves suspend/resume behavior of EHCI, as tested with
    "echo suspend > /sys/power/state" and "echo disk > /sys/power/state".
    
     - Quiescing the controller has to handle a case where the software has
       finished shutting down periodic and async schedules, but the hardware
       hasn't yet finished its part.
    
     - When suspending the root hub, be more by-the-book so that resumes
       behave better.
    
     - When resuming after suspend-to-disk, or in general when no port is
       suspended, the driver re-uses the initialization logic.  That logic
       needed to understand that resources don't need re-allocation, and
       that a few things need to be reset to the default state.
    
     - More code paths needed to notice a suspended controller, and stop
       right away.
    
     - To shut down the controller, start with the root hub ports and
       work up from there.
    
    Tested by writing "suspend" or "disk" to /sys/power/state; several
    systems resumed OK, at least given the associated usbcore patches.

    [PATCH] PCI: make pci_save_state() only happen when no suspend()
    
    Recent PCI changes are killing USB Power Management, and maybe more.
    
    The root cause is a change to the PCI suspend code from back in May,
    saving a copy of pci config space after the PCI driver did.  That
    was OK until a recent change made it overwrite the copy that the
    PCI device driver would later restore ... net result for USB is
    that DMA would always be disabled after resume.
    
    This patch restores the long-documented behavior of PCI driver
    suspend/resume calls (drivers are responsible for saving and
    restoring config space state), and also removes a superfluous line
    from the USB suspend logic.

    [PATCH] usbcore and system sleep states
    
    This patch makes usbcore behave better with system sleep states, fixing
    some PM/PCI integration problems as well as some PM/USB ones.
    
     - PCI HCDs should behave better, even if they don't support PCI PM;
       tested with both ACPI and APM suspend cycles, and swsusp.
    
     - Systems that advertise ACPI S1 support don't necessarily support the
       PCI D1 or D2 states for their USB controllers.  (Examples include
       Centrino laptops.)  This patch makes them suspend into D3hot, which
       always works (and won't take much longer to resume, either).
    
     - Handle the "go into deeper suspend" transition the way PCI drivers
       are supposed to.
    
     - Understand that USB only has one suspend state:  if the device is
       suspended, it can't do any better.
    
     - Export some symbols to HCDs, so they can reuse more of the existing
       usbcore framework.
    
    Plus minor related cleanups.
    
    The PCI D1/D2 state issue is a variant of an earlier problem, with the
    same root cause:  the PM core thinking there's a one-to-one mapping
    between system states (roughly:  ACPI S0/S1/S3/S4) and PCI states that
    a given device can support (only D0 is required, D3hot is common).
    That same issue comes up again with USB.

    This patch adds a workaround for host controllers that don't properly

    In the not-too-distant future I will have to revamp most of the root-hub
    suspend/resume code in the UHCI driver.  For now, please apply the patch.

    [PATCH] PCI: Updated patch to fix adapter speed mismatch for 2.6 kernel
    
    After doing more testing, I found that I couldn't use quirk to set the flag
    to identify the chipset, for there are platforms that have other bridge
    chip with PCI-X hotpluggable slots in the same system.  Therefore, I use
    the vendor id and device id to identify the bridge chip that needs the
    workaround. The code doing the workaround remains unchanged.

    [PATCH] Fix deadlocks on dpm_sem
    
    From: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>
    
    Currently the device_pm_foo() functions are rather prone to deadlocks
    during suspend/resume.  This is because the dpm_sem is held for the
    duration of device_suspend() and device_resume() as well as device_pm_add()
    and device_pm_remove().  If for any reason you get a device addition or
    removal triggered by a device's suspend or resume code, you get a deadlock.
     (The classic example is a USB host adaptor resuming and discovering that
    the mouse you used to have plugged in has gone away.)
    
    This patch fixes the problem by using a separate semaphore, called
    dpm_list_sem, to cover the places where we need the device pm lists to be
    stable, and by being careful about how we traverse the lists on suspend and
    resume.  I have analysed the various cases that can occur and I am
    confident that I have handled them all correctly.  I posted this patch
    together with a detailed analysis 10 days ago.

    [PATCH] sysfs backing store: stop pinning dentries/inodes for leaf entries
    
    From: Maneesh Soni <maneesh@in.ibm.com>
    
    o This patch stops the pinning of non-directory or leaf dentries and inodes.
      The leaf dentries and inodes are created during lookup based on the
      entries on sysfs_dirent tree. These leaves are removed from the dcache
      through the VFS dentry ageing process during shrink dcache operations. Thus
      reducing about 80% of sysfs lowmem needs.
    
    o This implments the ->lookup() for sysfs directory inodes and allocates
      dentry and inode if the lookup is successful and avoids the need of
      allocating and pinning of dentry and inodes during the creation of
      corresponding sysfs leaf entry. As of now the implementation has not
      required negative dentry creation on failed lookup. As sysfs is still a
      RAM based filesystem, negative dentries are not of any use IMO.
    
    o The leaf dentry allocated after successful lookup is connected to the
      existing corresponding sysfs_dirent through the d_fsdata field.

    [PATCH] sysfs backing store - add sysfs_direct structure
    
    From: Maneesh Soni <maneesh@in.ibm.com>
    
    o This patch introduces the new sysfs_dirent data structure. The sysfs_dirent
      is added to the dentry corresponding to each of the element which can be
      represented in sysfs like, kobject (directory), text or binary attributes
      (files), attribute groups (directory) and symlinks.
    
    o It uses dentry's d_fsdata field to attach the corresponding sysfs_dirent.
    
    o The sysfs_dirents are maintained in a tree of all the sysfs entries using the
      s_children and s_sibling list pointers.
    
    o This patch also changes how we access attributes and kobjects in
      file_operations from a given dentry, basically introducing one more level of
      indirection.
    
    o The sysfs_dirents are freed and the sysfs_dirent tree is updated accordingly
      upon the deletion of corresponding dentry. The sysfs dirents are kept alive
      as long as there is corresponding dentry around. The are freed when the
      dentry is finally out of dcache using the ->d_iput() method.
    
    o This also fixes the dentry leaks in case of error paths after sysfs has
      got a newly alocated (and hashed) dentry from sysfs_get_dentry() by
      d_drop()'ing the dentry.

    [PATCH] parisc: Fix N-class SMP
    
    Fix N class SMP
    
    The main fixes are:
    
     - memory barriers to our space and control register moves
     - fix for the N class merced bus problem which can't have more than
       one PxTLB broadcast outstanding at once
     - make smp_call_function() wait until the function completes
    
    This now boots and runs on a 32MB N4000 in Fort Collins with 2 cpus
    and discontig mem support.

    JFS: use alloc_metapage for consistency
    
    We defind alloc_metapage, but instead of using it, the potential callers
    are calling mempool_alloc directly.  Since we have and use the function,
    free_metapage, we should be consistent and use alloc_metapage.
    
    This patch also changes the argument to alloc_metapage so that the
    caller passes gfp_mask directly, rather than a less descriptive flag.

    We must unregister all serial ports before driver_unregister()

    serial8250_remove, including our legacy ISA ports.  We flag this
    special cleanup operation by setting serial8250_isa_devs to NULL
    and not handling our own platform device any differently from
    any others.

    [PATCH] parisc: spinlock fixes
    
     - Fix SMP f_list corruption problem.
    
       This was rather subtle.  It turns out that gcc was doing a small
       amount of reordering around the file_lock because it doesn't see our
       spinlock implementation as being a barrier.  To fix this I
    
       - Added the appropriate barriers to all the spinlocks.
       - Removed the atomic opencoded spinlock and redid it as a proper one.
    
       SMP now seems stable on a 2xA500 and has survived a 10 hour 35 loop
       make -j 4 kernel compile without showing any problems (previously, it
       usually fell over in the first loop).
    
     - Since we have one or two users who don't want SMP, make the
       code base compile for UP again ...
    
     - missing parenthesis for pointer dereferencing

    [ARM PATCH] 2178/1: mnfd (move negated) emulation is busted on big-
     endian
    
    Patch from Lennert Buytenhek
    
    When you issue the mnfd opcode to negate a double, nwfpe is supposed
    to flip the most significant bit of your double, which is the sign
    bit.  However, on big endian systems, it ended up flipping the most
    significant bit of the least significant sub-u32, which is one of the
    mantissa bits.
    
    On my system this was manifesting itself as sed regression tests
    failing, and ntpd/ntpdate consistently adjusting the system clock
    into the wrong direction.
    
    In pretty much all of NWFPE, doubles are stored in u64s and
    manipulations on those doubles are done by using u64 bitops.  But
    for negation and fabs() it was poking into one of the sub-u32s
    directly instead of XORing the u64 with 0x8000000000000000 resp.
    ANDing with 0x7fffffffffffffff.
    
    Since on big-endian, 'native u64 order' means that the most
    significant byte (containing bits 63-56) is kept at the lowest
    byte address, the sign bit is the MSB of the first sub-u32,
    instead of the MSB of the second one as is the case on little
    endian.

    kbuild: allow architectures to specify defconfig file with KBUILD_DEFCONFIG
    
    For some architectures is does not make sense to maintain a single default
    configuration - arm is a good example here.
    KBUILD_DEFCONFIG is introduced allowing relevant architectures to point out
    a configuration kept in arch/$(ARCH)/configs as the configuration
    to be used when executing 'make defconfig'.
    This patch selects versatile_defconfig as the default configuration for arm.
    
    The reason to keep defconfig is that is has proved valuable in many testing
    scenarios when one are doing a cross architecture build of the kernel to
    do a simple compile-time check of some changes.

    scroll(x) doesn't get expanded to wscrl(x, 1).  I did some quick
    grepping on Cygwin and Linux (debian/unstable) and didn't see
    CURS_MACROS show up anywhere else, but to be safe I put it inside of
    __sun__.  Next this uses libcurses instead of libncurses otherwise we
    get a bunch of undefined refs to w32attrset, w32addch, acs32map and few
    more.

    Annotate UP spinlock stubs with lock annotations.
    
    This way you can do a checking run on UP too - even if the
    locks don't actually _matter_, they should still be right,
    I'd hope.

    Lock-annotate some kernel functions as an example of how it works.
    
    In particular, a function that is called with a lock held, and
    releases it only to re-acquire it needs to be annotated as such,
    since otherwise sparse will complain about an unexpected unlock,
    even though "globally" the lock is constant over the call.

    This change allows platform devices named "serial8250" to provide
    lists of serial ports to the 8250 driver at runtime, in addition to
    the hard coded table in include/asm-*/serial.h.
    
    The next step is to deprecate the tables in serial.h.

    [ARM] Use cpu_vm_mask to determine whether to flush TLB/caches.
    
    Since bit 0 is only set when the MM is mapped onto the CPU, we can use
    this rather than comparing the MM pointer with current->active_mm.
    This simplifies the inline cache flushing and tlb code.

    [PATCH] uninline __sigqueue_alloc
    
    Christoph suggests letting the compiler choose.  No real compelling reason
    to inline anyhow.  I had some vmlinux size numbers suggesting inline was
    better, but re-running them on newer kernel is giving different results,
    favoring uninline.  Best let compiler choose.  Un-inline __sigqueue_alloc.

    Make x86 semaphore routines use register calling convention.
    
    This avoids a bug where the compiler would overwrite the
    stackframe that the caller also considered to be a register
    save area.
    
    It also shrinks the code segment by a tiny amount by moving
    the failure case argument setup into the slow path. This not
    only makes the fast path smaller, but it makes it easier on
    gcc (gcc is not very good at generating code that uses fixed
    register names).

    [PATCH] ext3: online resizing
    
    The patch below adds online resize capability to ext3 based on Andreas
    patch for 2.4 and fixed up by Stephen.
    
    The patch also removes s_debts:
    
    s_debts is currently not used by ext3 (it is created, destroyed and checked
    but never set).  Remove it for now.
    
    Resurrecting this will require adding it back in changed form.  In existing
    form it's already unsafe wrt.  byte-tearing as it performs unlocked byte
    increment/decrement on words which may be being accessed simultaneously on
    other CPUs.  It is also the only in-memory dynamic table which needs to be
    extended by online-resize, so locking it will require care.

    [PATCH] ext3 block reservations
    
    rbtree implementation and other changes From: Stephen Tweedie <sct@redhat.com>
    contributions From: Badari Pulavarty <pbadari@us.ibm.com> and probably me.
    
    This is the ext3 block reservation patch.  It improves the layout of ext3
    files by establishing, for each inode, reserved areas of the disk in which
    only that file can allocate blocks.  Those reserved areas are managed in an
    rbtree, via the in-core inode.
    
    It's a bit like ext2 preallocation only stronger in that it can span
    already-allocated blocks, including the per-blockgroup inode tables and
    bitmaps.
    
    The patch fixes ext3's worst performance problem: disastrous layout when
    multiple files are being concurrently grown.
    
    It increases the size of the inode by rather a lot.  A todo item is to
    dynamically allocate the `struct reserve_window_node', so we don't need to
    carry this storage for inodes which aren't opened for writing.
    
    The feature is enabled by mounting with the "reservation" mount option.
    Reservations default to "off".

    [PATCH] m32r: fix a typo of delay.c
    
    This patch fixes a typo of arch/m32r/lib/delay.c.  It is required to fix a
    compile error for non-CONFIG_ISA_DUAL_ISSUE configuration.
    
    NOTE:
    
      The m32r has a kind of ISA (instruction set architecture) like a 2-way
      VLIW.  Originally the m32r has two types of 16-bit/32-bit instructions.
      Only 16-bit instruction pair can be executed in parallel on a m32r chip
      with dual issuing support (e.g.  M32700).
    
      According to the insturction dual issuing of the m32r, a
      programmer/compiler can explicitly put two 16-bit instructions into an
      instruction word, which are to be executed in parallel.
    
      ex. Assembly coding style of two 16-bit instruncions; insn A and B:
    
        1) insn A
           insn B              ; sequential execution (implicit)
    
        2) insn A -> insn B	   ; sequential execution (explicit)
    
        3) insn A || insn B	   ; parallel execution

    This patch adds a hook 'pcibios_disable_device()' into pci_disable_device()
    to call architecture specific PCI resource deallocation code.  It's a
    opposite part of pcibios_enable_device().  We need this hook to deallocate
    architecture specific PCI resource such as IRQ resource, etc..  This patch
    is just for adding the hook, so 'pcibios_disable_device()' is defined as a
    null function on all architecture so far.
    
    I tested this patch on i386, x86_64 and ia64.  But it has not been tested
    on other architectures because I don't have these machines.

    Now that PCI interrupts are routed in pci_enable_device(), remove the
    unconditional routing previously done in pci_acpi_init().
    
    This has the potential to break drivers that don't use pci_enable_device()

    previous behavior.  I intend to remove that option, along with all the code

    [NETFILTER]: Avoid warning on CONNTRACK_STAT_INC in destroy_conntrack()
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    ip_conntrack_put can be called in any context in theory: in particular,
    MASQUERADE will can call it (via ip_ct_selective_cleanup) when an interface
    comes up with a different address.
    
    Move the CONNTRACK_STAT_INC inside the lock: it needs preemption disabled.

    Returning from tg3_poll() without flushing the PIO write which reenables

    use a memory barrier, mmiowb(), instead of flushing the write with a PIO
    read.

    [TG3]: Use mmiowb in tg3.c
    
    From: Jesse Barnes <jbarnes@engr.sgi.com>
    
    This patch originally from Greg Banks.  Some parts of the tg3 driver depend
    on PIO writes arriving in order.  This patch ensures that in two key places
    using the new mmiowb macro.  This not only prevents bugs (the queues can be
    corrupted), but is much faster than ensuring ordering using PIO reads
    (which involve a few round trips to the target bus on some platforms).
    
    Arthur has another patch that uses mmiowb in tg3 that he posted earlier as
    well.

    The "Synchronize Arbitration IDs with APIC IDs" IPI does not make sense

    The Intel Developers manual (Vol.  3, Ch.  8.6.1) says this IPI is
    unsupported on P4/Xeon.  Using it may, according to Intel, lead to

    [PATCH] issues with online scheduler switching
    
    There are two issues with online io scheduler switching that this patch
    addresses.  The first is pretty simple - it concerns racing with scheduler
    removal on switch.  elevator_find() does not grab a reference to the io
    scheduler, so before elevator_attach() is run it could go away.  Add
    elevator_get() to solve that.
    
    Second issue is the flushing out of requests that is needed before
    switching can be problematic with requests that aren't allocated in the
    block layer (such as requests on the stack of a process).  The problem is
    that we don't know when they will have finished, and most io schedulers
    need to access the elevator structures on io completion.  This can be fixed
    by adding an intermedia step that switches to noop, since it doesn't need
    to touch anything but the request_queue.  The queue drain can then safely
    be split into two operations - one that waits for file system requests, and
    one that waits for the queue to completely empty.  Requests arriving after
    the first drain will get stuck in a seperate queue list.

    [PATCH] handle posix message queues with /proc/sys disabled
    
    register_sysctl_table() fails if sysctl support is not compiled into the
    kernel.  The POSIX message queue subsystem aborted it's initialization if
    register_sysctl_table() fails, and that causes an oops in sys_mq_open().
    The patch fixes that by ignoring failures from register_sysctl_table().

    [PATCH] Lock initializer unifying (Network drivers)
    
    To make spinlock/rwlock initialization consistent all over the kernel,
    this patch converts explicit lock-initializers into spin_lock_init() and
    rwlock_init() calls.
    
    Currently, spinlocks and rwlocks are initialized in two different ways:
    
      lock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED
      spin_lock_init(&lock)
    
      rwlock = RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED
      rwlock_init(&rwlock)
    
    this patch converts all explicit lock initializations to
    spin_lock_init() or rwlock_init(). (Besides consistency this also helps
    automatic lock validators and debugging code.)
    
    The conversion was done with a script, it was verified manually and it
    was reviewed, compiled and tested as far as possible on x86, ARM, PPC.
    
    There is no runtime overhead or actual code change resulting out of this
    patch, because spin_lock_init() and rwlock_init() are macros and are
    thus equivalent to the explicit initialization method.

    [PATCH] Fix incorrect Mt Rainier detection
    
    cdrom_is_mrw() can incorrectly think that a drive is Mt Rainier capable,
    because if forgets to check if the "GET CONFIGURATION" command returns the
    MRW feature number.  According to the MMC spec, the drive shall return all
    feature numbers >= the starting feature number, so even if the drive
    doesn't support Mt Rainier, it can return some data that makes
    cdrom_is_mrw() incorrectly think the drive is MRW capable.
    
    This problem stops me from mounting DVD+RW discs in R/W mode on my laptop,
    because it makes cdrom_open_write() call cdrom_mrw_open_write() which fails
    because the drive isn't really MRW capable.
    
    The fix is to make sure the returned feature number is the correct one for
    Mt Rainier.

    [PATCH] RCU: eliminating explicit memory barriers from SysV IPC
    
    This patch uses the rcu_assign_pointer() API to eliminate a number of explicit
    memory barriers from the SysV IPC code that uses RCU.  It also restructures
    the ipc_ids structure so that the array size is stored in the same memory
    block as the array itself (see the new struct ipc_id_ary).  This prevents the
    race that the earlier code was subject to, where a reader could see a mismatch
    between the size and the actual array.  With the size stored with the array,
    the possibility of mismatch is eliminated -- with out the need for careful
    ordering and explicit memory barriers.  This has been tested successfully on
    i386 and ppc64.

    doesn't run the option ROM.  If we try to continue, radeonfb just gets

    [PATCH] vmscan: pages_scanned fix
    
    kswapd is still sometimes going into loops.  The problem seemed to be
    happening on systems with zero inactive pages in ZONE_DMA, so pages_scanned
    could never be increased, all_unreclaimable would never be set, and kswapd
    would never break.
    
    So change pages_scanned to be a count of the number of _active_ list pages
    scanned rather than inactive.  This has been reported to solve the problems.
    
    This is not subject to the reverse problem where one might have zero active
    list pages, because inactive pages are either be reclaimed, or put onto the
    active list.
    
    I think it is reasonable to have all_unreclaimed trigger based on the amount
    of active list scanning rather than inactive.

    vt.c.  That actually looks like last user in the tree; it should be
    possible to kill pm_access completely after 2.6.10.  Ouch and add warning
    to obsolete pm.txt file.

    [PATCH] ia64 iomap implementation
    
    This preserves the ioreadX() == inX() semantics (same as i386), since it's
    not clear that the speedup of omitting the mf.a for port operations is
    worth the risk of breaking drivers.

    [PATCH] x86-64 clustered APIC support
    
    Forthcoming IBM boxes will be using Nocona and/or Opteron chips in
    clustered mode to get beyond 8 CPUs.  In fact, there are plans to try for
    128 CPUs when the Tulsa chip comes out.  Thus, there are a fair number of
    signed vs.  unsigned changes in the patch.
    
    Thanks to the HPET timer and some HW changes, I've been able to remove the
    MPS/ACPI string comparisons from the detection code.  Instead, it scans
    bios_cpu_apicid and uses simple heuristics to select the correct IRQ
    delivery mode.  No need for a config option.  Hurrah!
    
    Likewise, I've been able to avoid the preprocessor tricks that the i386
    sub-arch needed to build with one or more sub-arches.

    hpet hardware seems to need a little prodding during resume for it to start

    [PATCH] ppc64: rework hugepage code
    
    Rework the ppc64 hugepage code.  Instead of using specially marked pmd
    entries in the normal pagetables to represent hugepages, use normal pte_t
    entries, in a special set of pagetables used for hugepages only.
    
    Using pte_t instead of a special hugepte_t makes the code more similar to
    that for other architecturess, allowing more possibilities for
    consolidating the hugepage code.
    
    Using independent pagetables for the hugepages is also a prerequisite for
    moving the hugepages into their own region well outside the normal user
    address space.  The restrictions imposed by the powerpc mmu's segment
    design mean we probably want to do that in the fairly near future.

    [PATCH] ppc64: cpu hotplug notifier for numa
    
    This patch is from Nathan Lynch <nathanl@austin.ibm.com>.
    
    The NUMA properties of all "possible" cpus are not necessarily available at
    boot time on ppc64 LPAR.  Only the properties for present cpus are known.
    
    This patch modifies the ppc64 numa code to map a cpu to its node right before
    it is brought up -- this means that secondary cpus are now mapped to their
    nodes during smp_init().  Cpus are removed from their nodes after they have
    gone offline.
    
    Also some minor cleanups:
    
    - Stash the "minimum common depth" in a global at boot time, so we don't
      have to rediscover it every time something changes.
    
    - Remove unnecessary variable from of_get_associativity() which is accessed
      while possibly uninitialized.
    
    - Remove the cpu portion from dump_numa_topology() since it will show only
      the boot cpu now.  We could display this information from smp_cpus_done() if
      necessary.

    [PATCH] SELinux: fix sidtab locking bug
    
    This patch by Kaigai Kohei fixes a bug in the SELinux sidtab code, where we
    do a spin_unlock_irq() while nested under another irq lock, which enables
    interrupts and allows a deadlock to happen:
    
      sidtab_set() is called between POLICY_WRLOCK and POLICY_WRUNLOCK in
      services.c:1092.  sidtab_set() uses SIDTAB_LOCK()/SIDTAB_UNLOCK(), but
      SIDTAB_UNLOCK() enables any interruptions because it's defined as
      spin_unlock_irq().  If an interruption occurs between SIDTAB_UNLOCK() and
      POLICY_WRUNLOCK, and interruption context try to hold the POLICY_RDLOCK,
      then a deadlock happen in the result.
    
    The solution is to save & restore flags on the inner lock, per the patch
    below.

    [PATCH] SELinux: fix netif bugs and simplify.
    
    This patch fixes and simplifies locking in the SELiunux netif cache.
    
    An old problem (which I forgot about) is fixed where a netif lookup can be
    followed by a preemption, causing a race against sel_netif_put().  Kaigai
    Kohei discovered a problem where netif lookups were also not protected
    against races with sel_netif_flush().
    
    The code has now been reworked to fix these problems, eliminate the
    refcounting and remove atomic operations entirely from the read path
    (generally making better use of RCU).  The avc entry ref has been removed
    as part of this simplification in anticipation of an RCU scalability patch
    which removes them in general.

    [PATCH] statm: shared = rss - anon_rss
    
    The third "shared" field of /proc/$pid/statm in 2.4 was a count of pages in
    the mm whose page_count is more than 1 (oddly, including pages shared just
    with swapcache).  That's too costly to calculate each time, so 2.6 changed
    it to the total file-backed extent.  But Andrea knows apps and users
    surprised when (rss - shared) goes negative: we need to provide an rss-like
    statistic, close to the 2.4 interpretation.
    
    Something that's quick and easy to maintain accurately is mm->anon_rss, the
    count of anonymous pages in the mm.  Then shared = rss - anon_rss gives a
    pretty good and meaningful approximation to 2.4's intention: wli confirms
    that this will be useful to Oracle too.
    
    Where to show it?  I think it's best to treat this as a bugfix and show it
    in the third field of /proc/$pid/statm, after resident, as before - there's
    no evidence that the total file-backed extent was found useful.
    
    Albert would like other fields to revert to page counts, but that's a lot
    harder: if mprotect can change the category of a page, then it can't be
    accounted as simply as this.  Only go that route if real need shown.

    procfs accounting, but could affect vma_merge - though at present all

    [CPUFREQ] Add a unified cpufreq debug infrastructure.
    
    cpufreq_debug_printk will print messages if
    
    a) debugging for the specified part is activated (add
            1 for core,
            2 for drivers,
            4 for governors
       and pass value as
            cpufreq.debug=<value>
       on the kernel command line).
    
    b) and either
            b1) printk_ratelimit() allows it to be printed,
            b2) the user disables ratelimit'ing by passing
                    cpufreq.debug_ratelimit=0
                on the kernel command line, _or_
            b3) during driver initialization [unless a different
                driver has been initialized successfully] and
                unloading, and whenever a new policy is set.
    
                The last point may cause for numerous messages
                if an userspace-based dynamic governor is used
                which mis-uses the policy interface to set specific
                frequencies. Oh, the ACPI processor.c interface
                to the file "performance" uses the same trick,
                but that interface is marked deprecated as well,
                so I don't care. And debugging isn't activated
                normally, you know...

    [PATCH] update total_vm on non-MMU configurations
    
    This patch fixes 3 problems with the nommu.c support code:
    
    1. export mem_map and vmtruncate (to make them the same as MMU version)
    
    2. update the total_vm usage in mmap routines
       Without this the OOM killer has no "badness" points to rate
       processes on...
    
       This patch was originally submitted by Giovanni Casoli
       <giovanni.casoli@atengineering.it> for a 2.4.26 kernel.
       I applied it to the 2.6.9 code.

    support all relocation types of the m68k and Coldfire families.
    This code is straight out of the m68k support for this.

    [PATCH] clean up HZ definition
    
    Clean up the definition of HZ on m68knommu systems.
    There is really only a couple of cases to handle, most
    boards use the traditional 100Hz still. Only special
    case out those that don't. The current code is just
    spaghetti.

    Some BIOSes export invalid _PSS entries where all bits are set to one. While
    this is totally contrary to the ACPI specification, BIOS vendors try to
    tell userspace that these entries should not be considered or used. In order
    to not fail on such entries, the speedstep-centrino already contains a
    method to ignore these things. However, due to a wrong ordering of checks
    the driver aborts nonetheless. So move some checks around.

    Sometimes, a user or userspace daemon wants a specific frequency is set,
    but that frequency is (temporarily) unavailable or becomes unavailable
    due to e.g. thermal considerations. As soon as this situation changes,
    the user wish should be re-evaluated. The attached patch saves the user
    wish in "cpu_set_freq", and re-uses that whenever appropriate.

    [MMC] Deprecate "req" member of mmc_data structure.
    
    Host drivers should now use the scatterlist rather than accessing
    the request directly.  This marks the request pointer as being
    deprecated so that host driver authors get a chance to fix their
    drivers up before we remove this member.

    [IA64-SGI] Update asm-ia64/sn/sn_cpuid.h macros
    
    (I missed a file in the cleanup code that I sent yesterday.)
    
    SGI SN code currently makes assumptions about the bits in the LID
    register. These assumptions do not conform to the bit specifications
    from Intel. For example, SN currently assumes that bits [28:16] of
    the LID contain the physical node ID of a node.
    
    This patch eliminates these assumptions. A SAL call is now used to translate
    LID values to the NASID/subnode/slice values that are needed for SN
    platforms. The results of the SAL call are saved in the SN nodepda.

    arm: Fix ARM kernel build with permitted binutils versions
    
    All ARM binutils versions post 2.11.90 contains an extra "feature" which
    interferes with the kernel in various ways - extra "mapping symbols"
    in the ELF symbol table '$a', '$t' and '$d'.  This causes two problems:
    
    1. Since '$a' symbols have the same value as function names, this
       causes anything which uses the kallsyms infrastructure to report
       wrong values.
    2. programs which parse System.map do not expect symbols to start with
       '$'.

    kbuild: warning fixes on Solaris 9
    
    The following set of patches is based loosely on the patches that
    Jean-Christophe Dubois came up with for 2.6.7.  Where as the original
    patches added a number of casts to unsigned char, I went the route of
    making the chars be explicitly signed.  I honestly don't know which
    route is better to go down.  Doing this is the bulk of the patch.  Out
    of the rest of the odds 'n ends is that on Solaris, Elf32_Word is a
    ulong, which means all of the printf's are unhappy (uint format, ulong
    arg) for most of the typedefs.

    This patch adds pci_get_legacy_ide_irq() to the PCI layer for dealing
    with PCI IDE chipsets that use the "legacy mode" IRQ routing, thus
    violating the normal PCI routing.  The generic implementation provides
    IRQ numbers 14 and 15, and it adds a ppc64 specific one with platform
    callbacks so that a plaform can provide different IRQ numbers for "legacy"
    IDE.  I only fixed the amd7xxx.c driver for now, I expect people using
    this interface will slowly fix their drivers (I will fix via soon as I'll
    need it too, and maybe a few others).

    [ide] remove unused internal exports from ide core
    
    From: Arjan van de Ven <arjan@fenrus.demon.nl>
    
    ide-iops.c exports a few functions that either have no users or have no
    users AND shouldn't be used by drivers; the patch below unexports them.
    
    -EXPORT_SYMBOL(SELECT_INTERRUPT);
    -EXPORT_SYMBOL(SELECT_MASK);
    -EXPORT_SYMBOL(QUIRK_LIST);
    -EXPORT_SYMBOL(ata_vlb_sync);
    
    only used in the core ide code
    
    -EXPORT_SYMBOL(ata_input_data);
    -EXPORT_SYMBOL(ata_output_data);
    
    drivers should (and do) use the hwif-> function pointer variant of these,
    these functions are internal and used for setting the default hwif->
    function pointers only. No need to export, in fact exporting is only asking
    for accidents

    [NETLINK]: Remove netlink_sock_nr
    
    This patch removes netlink_sock_nr which is only used by a printk
    statement in af_netlink.c.  Even that's only there if
    NETLINK_REFCNT_DEBUG is defined.
    
    If we were really looking for netlink refcnt bugs there are probably
    better places to do that anyway.

    [PATCH] faster signal handling on x86
    
    Optimize away the unconditional write to debug registers on signal delivery
    path.  This is already done on x86_64.
    
    We only need to write to dr7 if there is a breakpoint to re-enable, and
    MOVDR is a serializing instruction, which is expensive.  Getting rid of
    it gets a 33% faster signal delivery path (at least on Xeon - I didn't
    test other CPUs, so your gain may vary).
    
    [ Editors note: it's likely only that slow on Netburst.  Serializing is
      not that expensive, but it is likely that writing to %db7 invalidates
      the trace cache, which explains why it's so slow on Xeon - it's not
      just the op itself, it has to re-populate the cache all the time.
    					--- Linus ]
    
    
    Measured delta TSC for three paths on a 2.4GHz Xeon.
    
    1) With unconditional write to dr7 :  800-1000 cycles
    2) With conditional write to dr7   :  84-112 cycles
    3) With unlikely write to dr7      :  84 cycles
    
    Performance test using divzero microbenchmark (3 million divide by zeros):
    
    With unconditional write:
       7.445 real / 6.136 system
       7.529 real / 6.482 system
       7.541 real / 5.974 system
       7.546 real / 6.217 system
       7.445 real / 6.167 system
    
    With unlikely write:
       5.779 real / 4.518 system
       5.783 real / 4.591 system
       5.552 real / 4.569 system
       5.790 real / 4.528 system
       5.554 real / 4.382 system
    
    That's about a 33% speedup - more than I expected; apparently getting rid
    of the serializing instruction makes the do_signal path much faster.

    [PKT_SCHED]: Add net/sch_generic.h with generic sched definitions.
    
    Adds net/sch_generic.h containing all bits directly referenced by
    schedulers and classifiers. Map of users:
    
    Group 1)
     struct qdisc_rate_table         sch_*, tcf_police -> cls_*
    
       Could theoretically be moved to pkt_sched.h with Patch 4
       but the long term goal it so make net/act_api.h to being
       dependent on net/pkt_sched.h
    
    Group 2)
     struct Qdisc                    sch_*, tcf_proto -> cls_*
     struct Qdisc_ops                sch_*, tcf_proto -> cls_*
     struct Qdisc_class_ops          sch_*, tcf_proto -> cls_*
     struct tcf_proto_ops            sch_*, cls_*
     struct tcf_proto                sch_*, cls_*
    
       Obviously used by schedulers but also by classifiers to
       bind classes (tcf_proto -> Qdisc -> Qdisc_ops ->
       Qdisc_class_ops). tcf_proto OTOH is used by schedulers,
       (neat cross usage).
    
    Group 3)
     struct tcf_result               sch_*, cls_*
    
       Used to communicate between scheduler and classifer
       to report classify result.
    
    Group 4)
     sch_tree_(un)lock               sch_*, cls_*
     tcf_tree_(un)lock               sch_*, cls_*
     qdisc(un)lock_tree              sch_*, cls_*
    
       Randomly used in schedulers and classifiers.
    
    Group 5)
     tcf_destroy                     sch_*, cls_api.c
    
       Coud theoretically be moved to pkt_sched.h if we include
       pkt_sched.h in cls_api.c but this is really generic and
       it seemd cleaner to have it here. This would be the only
       classifier related action in pkt_sched.h
    
    The following types are referenced in sch_generic.h but defined in
    either pkt_cls.h or pkt_sched.h because they will never be used
    by the other side:
    
      - qdisc_walker (pkt_sched.h)
      - tcf_walker (pkt_cls.h)

    the site of the other caller, tcp.c.

    [PATCH] Wake up signalled tasks when exiting ptrace
    
    In general it is not safe to do any non-ptrace wakeup of a thread in
    TASK_TRACED, because the waking thread could race with a ptrace call
    that could be doing things like mucking directly with its kernel stack.
    
    AFAIK noone has established that whatever clobberation ptrace can do to
    a running thread is safe even if it will never return to user mode, so
    we can't allow this even for SIGKILL.
    
    What we _can_ safely do is make a thread switching out of TASK_TRACED
    resume rather than sitting in TASK_STOPPED if it has a pending SIGKILL
    or SIGCONT.  The following patch does this.
    
    This should be sufficient for the shutdown case.  When killing all
    processes, if the tracer gets killed first, the tracee goes into
    TASK_STOPPED and will be woken and killed by the SIGKILL (same as
    before).  If the tracee gets killed first, it gets a pending SIGKILL and
    doesn't wake up immediately--but, now, when the tracer gets killed, the
    tracee will then wake up to die.
    
    This will also fix the (same) situations that can arise now where you
    have used gdb (or whatever ptrace caller), killed -9 the gdb and the
    process being debugged, but still have to kill -CONT the process before
    it goes away (now it should just go away either the first time or when
    you kill gdb).

    [PATCH] 8250: Fix empty port registration
    
    My latest 8250 patch prevented registration of "empty" ports (ports that
    have a 0 iobase in the static table). Unfortunately, some archs seem to rely
    on this, and so broke. This patch reverts that part of the patch.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Add new "Maple" platform support
    
    This adds support for the Maple 970FX Eval Board.  It adds the basic
    arch support.  For the Maple to be fully functional, it needs a couple
    more patches to be applied for IDE and Ethernet that are currently
    pending with the respective maintainers of those subsystems.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix g5-only build
    
    The iommu_free_table() patch broke g5 only build by adding back some
    incestuous relationship between generic code and pSeries code.
    
    This wraps this in #ifdef as a quick fix until the original author of
    the patch comes up with a better solution.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix new mpic driver on some POWER3
    
    On machines using the "ISU" mecanism for the MPIC, the new driver didn't properly
    calculate the new interrupt count when an ISU was added. That would cause later on
    failure to request interrupts in the offending range.

    [PATCH] ppc64: PCI ignores empty phb regions
    
    The ppc64 PCI code, when parsing the OF tree, may end up getting empty
    regions in addition to the "normal" ones for the PHB (some pSeries OF
    device-tree contains weird "ranges" properties). These are harmless but
    do trigger some annoying warnings during boot, so let's ignore them.

    [TCP]: Handle real partial-ACKs of TSO frames correctly.
    
    Actually, I think we've caught your crash now.  If that code path
    is triggering at all, then it'll trigger with TSO packets too.  If
    we get a truly partial ack on a TSO packet, then tcp_tso_acked will
    not trim it off.  So we will fall through to this last-ditch trim
    call, which doesn't update packets_out.
    
    There are two solutions to this problem.  I've taken the simpler
    approach for now.  We simply trim off the partial bits in tcp_tso_acked
    and live with the fact that the packet counters may differ from
    what's on the netwrok by one.
    
    Later on we can 'fix' this by remembering where the original TSO
    packet started from, perhaps in skb->h or somewhere.  Dave, is this
    worth it?

    [CRYPTO]: reduce sha512_transform() stack usage, speedup
    
    Patch moves large temporary u64 W[80] from stack to ctx struct:
    
    * reduces stack usage by 640 bytes
    * saves one 640-byte memset() per sha512_transform()
      (we still do it after *all* iterations are done)
    * quite unexpectedly saves 1.6k of code on i386
      because stack offsets now fit into 8bits
      and many stack addressing insns got 3 bytes smaller:
    
    # size sha512.o.org sha512.o

    [DECNET]: Connect hang bugfix
    
    This patch fixes a bug in the DECnet connect that seems to have been in 2.6 for
    a while now.
    
    If a connection is rejected by a remote host (eg invalid access control, no
    such object etc) the Linux end hangs in connect() because it is only waiting for
    the socket to go into RUN state.
    
    This patch sets the ECONNREFUSED error state on the socket when the connection
    is rejected to that the connect() exits it's wait loop and returns the error to
    the user.

    [PATCH] I/O space write barrier
    
    On some platforms (e.g.  SGI Challenge, Origin, and Altix machines), writes
    to I/O space aren't ordered coming from different CPUs.  For the most part,
    this isn't a problem since drivers generally spinlock around code that does
    writeX calls, but if the last operation a driver does before it releases a
    lock is a write and some other CPU takes the lock and immediately does a
    write, it's possible the second CPU's write could arrive before the
    first's.
    
    This patch adds a mmiowb() call to deal with this sort of situation, and
    adds some documentation describing I/O ordering issues to
    deviceiobook.tmpl.  The idea is to mirror the regular, cacheable memory
    barrier operation, wmb.  Example of the problem this new macro solves:
    
    CPU A:  spin_lock_irqsave(&dev_lock, flags)
    CPU A:  ...
    CPU A:  writel(newval, ring_ptr);
    CPU A:  spin_unlock_irqrestore(&dev_lock, flags)
            ...
    CPU B:  spin_lock_irqsave(&dev_lock, flags)
    CPU B:  writel(newval2, ring_ptr);
    CPU B:  ...
    CPU B:  spin_unlock_irqrestore(&dev_lock, flags)
    
    In this case, newval2 could be written to ring_ptr before newval.  Fixing
    it is easy though:
    
    CPU A:  spin_lock_irqsave(&dev_lock, flags)
    CPU A:  ...
    CPU A:  writel(newval, ring_ptr);
    CPU A:  mmiowb(); /* ensure no other writes beat us to the device */
    CPU A:  spin_unlock_irqrestore(&dev_lock, flags)
            ...
    CPU B:  spin_lock_irqsave(&dev_lock, flags)
    CPU B:  writel(newval2, ring_ptr);
    CPU B:  ...
    CPU B:  mmiowb();
    CPU B:  spin_unlock_irqrestore(&dev_lock, flags)
    
    Note that this doesn't address a related case where the driver may want to
    actually make a given write get to the device before proceeding.  This
    should be dealt with by immediately reading a register from the card that
    has no side effects.  According to the PCI spec, that will guarantee that
    all writes have arrived before being sent to the target bus.  If no such
    register is available (in the case of card resets perhaps), reading from
    config space is sufficient (though it may return all ones if the card isn't
    responding to read cycles).  I've tried to describe how mmiowb() differs
    from PCI posted write flushing in the patch to deviceiobook.tmpl.

    [PATCH] Posix layer <-> clock driver API fix
    
    This is needed for an mmtimer driver update that we are currently working
    on.  The mmtimer driver provides CLOCK_SGI_CYCLE via clock_gettime and
    clock_settime.
    
    With this api fix one will be able to use timer_create, timer_settime and
    friends from userspace to schedule and receive signals via timer interrupts
    of mmtimer.
    
    Changelog
    	* Clean up timer api for drivers that use register_posix_clock. Drivers
    	  will then be able to use posix timers to schedule interrupts.
    	* Change API for posix_clocks[].timer_create to only pass one pointer
    	  to a k_itimer structure that is now allocated and managed by the
    	  posix layer in the same way as for the other posix timer
    	  functions.
    	* Isolate a posix_timer_event(timr) function in posix-timers.c that may
    	  be called by the interrupt routine of a timer to signal that the
    	  scheduled event has taken place.

    [PATCH] Add DAC check for setxattr(security.selinux)
    
    This patch against 2.6.9 adds a DAC ownership check to the existing MAC
    permission checks when setting the security.selinux attribute via setxattr.
    In the past, the MAC permission checks were viewed as sufficient for
    controlling relabeling operations, but experience in the Fedora SELinux
    integration has shown that a DAC check is also appropriate here,
    particularly under targeted policy.

    [PATCH] boot parameters: quoting of environment variables revisited
    
    As noticed by Joey Hess (and thanks for Christoph for forwarding it).  Also
    requirements from Werner Almesberger.
    
    If someone passes 'foo="some value"' the param engine removes the quotes
    and hands 'foo' and 'some value'.  The __setup() parameters expect a single
    string, and so we try to regenerate it from the two parts.  Finally, we try
    to place it as an environment variable.
    
    Werner wants quotes stripped out of the environment variable.  It makes
    sense to do that for __setup, too (so it sees 'foo=some value'), since
    __setup functions don't usually handle quotes.

    [PATCH] Builtin Module Parameters in sysfs too
    
    Currently, only module parameters in loaded modules are exported in
    /sys/modules/, while those of "modules" built into the kernel can be set by
    the kernel command line, but not read or set via sysfs.
    
    - move module parameters from /sys/modules/$(module_name)/$(parameter_name) to
      /sys/modules/$(module_name)/parameters/$(parameter_name)
    
    - remove dummy kernel_param for exporting refcnt, add "struct module *"-based
      attribute instead
    
    - also export module paramters for "modules" which are built into the kernel,
      so parameters are always accessible at
      /sys/modules/$(KBUILD_MODNAME)/$(parameter_name)

    [PATCH] acct: report single record for multithreaded process
    
    This patch changes process accounting to write just one record for a
    process with many NPTL threads, rather than one record for each thread.  No
    record is written until the last thread exits.  The process's record shows
    the cumulative time of all the threads that ever lived in that process
    (thread group).  This seems like the clearly right thing and I assume it is
    what anyone using process accounting really would like to see.
    
    There is a race condition between multiple threads exiting at the same time
    to decide which one should write the accounting record.  I couldn't think
    of anything clever using existing bookkeeping that would get this right, so
    I added another counter for this.  (There may be some potential to clean up
    existing places that figure out how many non-zombie threads are in the
    group, now that this count is available.)

    [PATCH] fbdev: Clean up of fbcon/fbdev cursor interface
    
    The current cursor interface is confusing.  Some fields are taken from the
    cursor structure in struct fb_info (enable, mask, rop fields) and the rest are
    taken from the passed cursor structure.  These lead to a lot of confusion,
    making it hard for developers to write their own implementation.
    
    Also, the cursor code has several 'short-circuits', occassionally leading to
    undefined cursor behavior.
    
    These are the changes brought about by the patch:
    
    - Removed struct fb_cursor and related fields from struct fb_info, and
      instead, placed them in a struct not visible to fbdev.
    
    - The struct fb_cursor passed to fb_cursor() will _always_ contain valid
      data with various bitflags indicating which fields have changed
    
    - The struct fb_pixmap sprite in struct fb_info is used only by drivers with
      hardware cursor implementation.  Initializing and allocating memory for this
      structure is not needed.  Remove initialization and memory allocation.
    
    - The FBIO_CURSOR ioctl is broken (because fb_cursor() is broken).  For now,
      remove fb_cursor code and make the FBIO_CURSOR ioctl always return -ENODEV.
    
    - The flag FB_CUR_SETCUR is changed to FB_CUR_SETIMAGE, indicating that the
      cursor sprite has changed.  The image change is now checked by fbcon so
      drivers will not unnecessarily load the sprite image everytime.  This causes
      hardware cursors to flicker, especially in rivafb.
    
    - Remove fb_load_cursor_image().  This is unused, and should not be
      implemented generically.
    
    - Documented the usage of the cursor interface in skeletonfb.c

    [PATCH] device-mapper: dm-crypt: new IV mode ESSIV
    
    This patch adds a new IV mode ''encrypted sector|salt IV'' described in
      http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.device-mapper.dm-crypt/472
    
    To use ESSIV, set the ivmode (using the new syntax) to "essiv:<hash>".
    "hash" should be a valid cryptoapi hash.
    
    This, for example, is a valid dm-target line:
    
    0 200 crypt aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 00000000000000000000000000000000 0 /dev/loop/5 0

    Create crypt_iv_operations structure with generator method and move the
    plain iv generator into this structure.  Optionally accept an extended
    <sector format> syntax: <cipher>-<chaining mode>-<iv mode>
    
    This also makes it ready to support chaining modes other than CBC
    mode, such as CMC (not implemented in cryptoapi yet),
    The problems outlined by Adam J. Richter in
      http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.device-mapper.dm-crypt/454
    would be fixed by switching to CMC chaining mode.

    [PATCH] Change pagevec counters back to unsigned long and cacheline align
    
    Change pagevec "nr" and "cold" back to "unsigned long", because <4 byte
    accesses can be slow on architectures < Pentium III (additional "data16"

    This still honours the cacheline alignment, making the size of "pagevec"

    [PATCH] cpia.c rmmod deadlock fix
    
    Newer versions of module-init-tools do some locking now which leads to a
    dead-lock if cpia.c does a request_module("cpia_usb/pp").  The attached
    patch against 2.6.8 removes the request_module.  The problem is actually
    the same as is documented in debian bug #259056 which was caused by alsa
    autoloading some oss-modules.  So I guess there might be more places in the
    kernel where this new locking in the module-init-tools might lead to
    dead-locks.

    [PATCH] Weak symbols in modules and versioned symbols
    
    Weak symbol may be unavailable in kernel, but if it is available, its
    signature should be same as was at the build time.  If we do not attach
    signatures to weak symbols, kernel is tainted when such module is loaded.
    
    vmmon: no version for "sys_ioctl" found: kernel tainted.
    
    I also believe that it is safer to add & check signatures here - module
    wants either sys_ioctl with right signature, or no sys_ioctl at all, not
    sys_ioctl with different signature (which signals that there is some
    misbuild occuring).

    [PATCH] md: modify locking when accessing subdevices in md
    
    Each md personality keeps a list of devices that are currently active in the
    array (mdk_rdev_t).  As these can potentially be removed at any time, some
    locking is needed when accessing entries in the list.  Currently this involves
    a spinlock, but all the spinlocking this imposed in unplug_slaves bothered me.
    
    So, I have changed it to use rcu locking.  This is more appropriate as objects
    are removed only very rarely, and there is no cost in waiting a little while
    for a remove to succeed.
    
    Also, all changes to the list of devices are performed by the per-array thread
    (calling md_check_recovery) and so are completely single threaded, so no
    locking between writers is needed at all.
    
    Finally, devices are never added or removed while resync is happening, so
    resync doesn't need to worry about locking at all.
    
    So with this patch, the spinlocking is replaced with rcu read locking and
    synchronize_kernel.  The rcu_read_lock is held while dereferencing a possible
    device, and the nr_pending count is atomically incremented if the device is to
    be held outside of the rcu_read_lock.
    
    When removing a device, if the nr_pending count appears to be zero, we set the
    list entry to NULL and call synchronize_kernel().  If the count is still zero
    after this, we have a safe removal.  If it is non-zero, then someone has just
    started using it so we put the pointer back and fail the removal.  When the
    new user finally drops it's reference, that will cause the per-array thread to
    wake up again and retry the removal.

    [PATCH] md: remove md_flush_all
    
    Following are 7 patches for md
    
    They all grew out of a desire to redo the locking in unplug_slave.  Getting
    and dropping a spinlock so often for very little gain (it would be nearly
    impossible to lose the relevant race) really bothered me.
    
    I finally figured that I could reply it with rcu locking which is very light
    wait, and quite up to the task.
    
    One the way I found an number of inconsistencies that needed cleaning up and
    even a few bugs to fix.  The first 6 patches deal with these inconsistencies
    and bugs.  The last redoes the locking for adding/removing/accessing devices
    within md personalities.
    
    
    This patch:
    
    md_flush_all() isn't needed as each personality defines its own
    issue_flush_fn.

    [PATCH] sched: active_load_balance fixes
    
    The following patch against the latest mm fixes several problems with
    active_load_balance().
    
    Rather than starting with the highest allowable domain (SD_LOAD_BALANCE is
    still set) and depending on the order of the cpu groups, we start at the
    lowest domain and work up until we find a suitable CPU or run out of
    options (SD_LOAD_BALANCE is no longer set).  This is a more robust approach
    as it is more explicit and not subject to the construction order of the cpu
    groups.
    
    We move the test for busiest_rq->nr_running <=1 into the domain loop so we
    don't continue to try and move tasks when there are none left to move.
    This new logic (testing for nr_running in the domain loop) should make the
    busiest_rq==target_rq condition really impossible, so we have replaced the
    graceful continue on fail with a BUG_ON.  (Bjorn Helgaas, please confirm)
    
    We eliminate the exclusion of the busiest_cpu's group from the pool of
    available groups to push to as it is the ideal group to push to, even if
    not very likely to be available.  Note that by removing the test for
    group==busy_group and allowing it to also be tested for suitability, the
    running time is nearly the same.
    
    We no longer force the destination CPU to be in a group of completely idle
    CPUs, nor to be the last in that group.

    [PATCH] schedstat: fix schedule() statistics
    
    The number of times schedule() left the processor idle in the
    /proc/schedstat (runqueue.sched_goidle) seems to be wrong.
    
    The schedule() statistics should satisfy the equation:
    	sched_cnt == sched_noswitch + sched_switch + sched_goidle
    
    (http://eaglet.rain.com/rick/linux/schedstat/v10/format-10.html)

    [PATCH] sched: improved load_balance() tolerance for pinned tasks
    
    A large number of processes that are pinned to a single CPU results in
    every other CPU's load_balance() seeing this overloaded CPU as "busiest",
    yet move_tasks() never finds a task to pull-migrate.  This condition occurs
    during module unload, but can also occur as a denial-of-service using
    sys_sched_setaffinity().  Several hundred CPUs performing this fruitless
    load_balance() will livelock on the busiest CPU's runqueue lock.  A smaller
    number of CPUs will livelock if the pinned task count gets high.  This
    simple patch remedies the more common first problem: after a move_tasks()
    failure to migrate anything, the balance_interval increments.  Using a
    simple increment, vs.  the more dramatic doubling of the balance_interval,
    is conservative and yet also effective.

    [PATCH] ppc64: __ioremap_explicit() criterion change
    
    This patch is from John Rose <johnrose@austin.ibm.com>.
    
    The function __ioremap_explicit() misses a possible (obscure) case when
    reserving the imalloc area for the new region.  This can result in the
    unexpected DLPAR-add failure for an I/O slot.  The failure will be
    characterized by a kernel message resembling "could not obtain imalloc area
    for ea 0x..." Here's an explanation:
    
    At boot time, imalloc regions are created for the ranges of all PHBs.  Upon
    removal of a child slot for one of these PHBs, the imalloc region is split
    so that the region for the child slot can be removed.
    
    A GFW testcase revealed the following scenario.  A PHB is remapped at boot
    for virtual address range A through C.  At boot, the partition owns a slot
    that spans from A to B.  This slot is DLPAR-removed, leaving an imalloc
    region from B to C.  At this point, the user DLPAR adds an EADS slot that
    was not present at boot, but is a child of the PHB.  The new slot happens
    to have a range that directly matches the leftover PHB range, from B to C.
    The existing code does not expect this, so the operation fails.

    This patch is from John Rose <johnrose@austin.ibm.com>.
    
    The patch below creates iommu_free_table().  Iommu tables are not currently
    freed in PPC64.  This could cause a memory leak for DLPAR of an EADS slot.
    The function verifies that there are no outstanding TCE entries for the
    range of the table before freeing it.  I added a call to iommu_free_table()
    to the code that dynamically removes a device node.  This should be fairly
    symmetrical with the table allocation, which happens during dynamic
    addition of a device node.

    [PATCH] ppc64: provide notifier list for EEH slot isolations
    
    When the EEH (enhanced i/o error handling) hardware on pSeries detects
    various kinds of PCI errors, it immediately freezes and isolates the slot
    of the offending PCI card.  We get to know about that by noticing that
    reads from the device return all-1s, and then we have to do a firmware call
    to find out whether the all-1s value was due to a slot isolation.
    
    This patch adds a notifier so that other parts of the system (e.g.  the RPA
    PCI hotplug driver) can know that a slot isolation event has occurred and
    take whatever recovery action is appropriate.  The notifier is called in a
    workqueue function, although the read from the device that noticed the
    all-1s value may have been at interrupt level.  As a precaution, if we keep
    trying to read from the device at interrupt level, and do 1000 reads
    without the workqueue getting a chance to run, we panic, on the grounds
    that we presumably have a badly-written driver which will spin forever in
    its interrupt routine, e.g.  waiting for a bit in a device register to go
    to 0.

    [PATCH] lsm: fix send_sigurg mediation
    
    Stephen Smalley notes that send_sigurg isn't mediated by LSM in the same
    manner as send_sigio.  Patch below is a slight modification of Stephen's
    original patch.  It moves the security_file_send_sigiotask() hook into the
    sigio_perm().  The hook's fd and reason arguments are replaced with the
    signum.  sigio_perm() and it's callers are updated to pass the signum
    through to the hook.  In send_sigio case, the signum is simply fown->signum
    or SIGIO when signum is 0, however in send_sigurg the kernel doesn't use
    fown->signum, it always sends SIGURG.

    This is what the following patch does.  The only 'rider' bit is the
    removal of an unnecessary BUG_ON in ip6_pkt_discard_out.  The preceding

    This allows for low-latency BKL contention even with

    resuming a process would be non-preemtible.

    [PATCH] Avoid small irq preemption recursion window
    
    This will get rid of the stack recursion possibility that can occur if
    an IRQ happens to hit the IRQ return path right after we've reset
    preempt_count() to 0 and are about to disable interrupts again.
    Trivially fixed by just moving the preempt count update to inside the
    interrupt disable.
    
    This makes the current PREEMPT_ACTIVE method fully work for IRQ
    recursions.

    [PNPBIOS] disable if ACPI is active
    
    As further ACPI pnp functionaility is implemented it is no longer
    safe to run ACPI and PNPBIOS concurrently.
    
    We therefore take the following approach:
    - attempt to enable ACPI support
    - if ACPI fails (blacklist etc.) enable pnpbios support
    - if ACPI support is not compiled in the kernel enable pnpbios support

    This patch reworks the code that deals with matching PCI devices

    difference now is that PHBs are no longer special cased, but that
    shouldn't cause any specific problem.
    
    It also fixes a problem where u3_iommu.c wouldn't work for PCI

    This patch adds a ppc64 implementation of the routine providing

    by default unless the platform code fills it, and it provides
    a generic function for user by Open Firmware based machines which
    fills the list based on serial ports found in the OF device-tree.

    this to the 8250 driver.

    This finally allows to fix the problem of platforms like ppc and ppc64
    for which the same kernel can boot machines with and without a 8250, and
    is necessary to properly deal with a new platform coming to ppc64 which
    has a 8250 but with different irq numbers.

    It is smaller, hopefully more readable, supports the various variants
    of the cell in a single driver (open_pic_u3.c is gone), and adds
    optional support for the workaround of U3 mpic beeing used along with
    IO-APICs on HyperTransport (the eval board will uses that, among

    [PATCH] SCSI core: Fix refcounting error
    
    This bug was present as of 2.6.9-bk7, apparently introduced along with the
    addition of SCSI targets into sysfs.  The code takes a reference to the
    host for each initialized sdev but only drops a reference when each
    target is released.  As you might expect, this causes a refcount leak
    whenever a target has more than 0 LUNs.
    
    The patch changes things so that the reference is acquired when the target
    is initialized, not when the sdev is initialized.

    Annotate the trivial unconditional lock/unlock functions on SMP.
    
    This does _not_ handle the conditional ones (lock_kernel and the
    trylock variants), so there will be a fair number of context
    error warnings with this. However, the warnings are disabled by
    default in sparse - you have to use "-Wcontext" to see them.

    This just sets up the portability defines.

    [PATCH] fix core-dump return code
    
    While looking at the signal.c coredumping BUG_ON race, I noticed a bug
    (not directly related) in do_coredump.  It was setting the "core dumped"
    flag even when the format dumping hook failed (e.g.  for memory
    allocation failures).

    [PATCH] Fix ptrace problem
    
    This is indeed a new bug, and it is not architecture-specific.  In my
    recent changes to close some race conditions, I overlooked the case of a
    process using PTRACE_ATTACH on its own children.  The new PT_ATTACHED flag
    does not really mean "PTRACE_ATTACH was used", it means "PTRACE_ATTACH is
    changing the ->parent link".
    
    This fixes the problem that Stephane Eranian program demonstrates.

    [PATCH] Invalid BUG_ONs in signal.c
    
    Oh, duh.  The race is obvious.  Sorry for the confusion there.
    
    The BUG_ON's were useful for debugging, since they trigger on a lot of
    errors, but they _also_ trigger on some unlikely (but valid) races.
    
    So just remove them - just fall through to the regular exit code after
    core-dumping (which does everything right).

    [PATCH] delay rq_lock acquisition in setscheduler
    
    Doing access control checks with rq_lock held can cause deadlock when
    audit messages are created (via printk or audit infrastructure) which
    trigger a wakeup and deadlock, as noted by both SELinux and SubDomain
    folks.  This patch will let the security checks happen w/out lock held,
    then re-sample the p->policy in case it was raced.
    
    Originally from John Johansen <johansen@immunix.com>, reworked by me.
    AFAIK, this version drew no objections from Ingo or Andrea.

    [PCMCIA] Fix PCMCIA behaviour on resume with different card.
    
    PCMCIA checks the card CIS against its cached copy.  If it finds
    that the card does not match, it destroys the bindings with existing
    drivers, issues an remove event followed by an insert event.  However,
    ds.c delays the remove event by 100ms, so cardmgr sees the insert
    before remove.  It thereby ignores the new card.
    
    Also, we ended up leaving the fake CIS intact, so the new card appears
    to be described by the fake CIS.  Destroy the fake CIS in addition to
    the CIS cache.

    Note: ACPI CA is currently undergoing an in-depth and
    complete formal evaluation to test/verify the following
    areas. Other suggestions are welcome. This will result in
    an increase in the frequency of releases and the number
    of bug fixes in the next few months.
    
    - Functional tests for all ASL/AML operators
    - All implicit/explicit type conversions
    - Bit fields and operation regions
    - 64-bit math support and 32-bit-only "truncated" math support
    - Exceptional conditions, both compiler and interpreter
    - Dynamic object deletion and memory leaks
    - ACPI 3.0 support when implemented
    - External interfaces to the ACPI subsystem
    
    Fixed two alignment issues on 64-bit platforms -
    within debug statements in acpi_ev_gpe_detect and
    acpi_ev_create_gpe_block. Removed references to the
    Address field within the non-aligned ACPI generic address
    structure.
    
    Fixed a problem in the Increment and Decrement operators
    where incorrect operand resolution could result in the
    inadvertent modification of the original integer when the
    integer is passed into another method as an argument and
    the arg is then incremented/decremented.
    
    Fixed a problem in the FromBCD operator where the upper
    32-bits of a 64-bit BCD number were truncated during
    conversion.
    
    Fixed a problem in the ToDecimal operator where the length
    of the resulting string could be set incorrectly too long
    if the input operand was a Buffer object.
    
    Fixed a problem in the Logical operators (LLess,
    etc.) where a NULL byte (0) within a buffer would
    prematurely terminate a compare between buffer objects.
    
    Added a check for string overflow (>200 characters as per
    the ACPI specification) during the Concatenate operator
    with two string operands.

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20041006 from Bob Moore
    
    Signed-off-by: Len Brown <len.brown@intel.com>
    
    Implemented support for the ACPI 3.0 Timer operator. This
    ASL function implements a 64-bit timer with 100 nanosecond
    granularity.
    
    Defined a new OSL interface, acpi_os_get_timer. This
    interface is used to implement the ACPI 3.0 Timer
    operator. This allows the host OS to implement the timer
    with the best clock available.  Also, it keeps the core
    subsystem out of the clock handling business, since the
    host OS (usually) performs this function.
    
    Fixed an alignment issue on 64-bit platforms. The
    hw_low_level_read/write() functions use a 64-bit address
    which is part of the packed ACPI Generic Address
    Structure. Since the structure is non-aligned, the
    alignment macros are now used to extract the address to
    a local variable before use.
    
    Fixed a problem where the ToInteger operator assumed all
    input strings were hexadecimal. The operator now handles
    both decimal strings and hex strings (prefixed with "0x").
    
    Fixed a problem where the string length in the string
    object created as a result of the internal ConvertToString
    procedure could be incorrect.  This potentially affected
    all implicit conversions and also the ToDecimalString and
    ToHexString operators.
    
    Fixed two problems in the ToString operator. If the
    length parameter was zero, an incorrect string object was
    created and the value of the input length parameter was
    inadvertently changed from zero to Ones.
    
    Fixed a problem where the optional ResourceSource string
    in the ExtendedIRQ resource macro was ignored.
    
    Simplified the interfaces to the internal division
    functions, reducing code size and complexity.

    Added a new OSL interface, acpi_os_get_timer.  This
    interface implements a 64-bit monotonic timer in 100
    nanosecond units.
    
    Implemented support for the ACPI 3.0 Timer operator.
    This 64-bit timer utilizes the timer provided by the
    acpi_os_get_timer interface.

    Fixed a problem with the implementation of the LNot()
    operator where "Ones" was not returned for the TRUE
    case. Changed the code to return Ones instead of (!Arg)
    which was usually 1. This change affects iASL constant
    folding for this operator also.
    
    Fixed a problem in acpi_ut_initialize_buffer where an
    existing buffer was not initialized properly -- Now zero
    the entire buffer in this case where the buffer already
    exists.
    
    Changed the interface to acpi_os_sleep from (UINT32
    Seconds, UINT32 Milliseconds) to simply (ACPI_INTEGER
    Milliseconds). This simplifies all related code
    considerably. This requires changes/updates to all OS
    interface layers (OSLs.)
    
    Implemented a new external interface,
    acpi_install_exception_handler, to allow a system exception
    handler to be installed. This handler is invoked upon
    any run-time exception that occurs during control method
    execution.
    
    Added support for the DSDT in acpi_tb_find_table. This
    allows the DataTableRegion() operator to access the local
    copy of the DSDT.

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20040827 update from Bob Moore
    
    Signed-off-by: Len Brown <len.brown@intel.com>
    
    Implemented support for implicit object conversion in
    the non-numeric logical operators (LEqual, LGreater,
    LGreaterEqual, LLess, LLessEqual, and LNotEqual.) Any
    combination of Integers/Strings/Buffers may now be used;
    the second operand is implicitly converted on the fly to
    match the type of the first operand.  For example:
    
    LEqual (Source1, Source2)
    
    Source1 and Source2 must each evaluate to an integer, a
    string, or a buffer. The data type of Source1 dictates the
    required type of Source2.  Source2 is implicitly converted
    if necessary to match the type of Source1.
    
    Updated and corrected the behavior of the string
    conversion support.  The rules concerning conversion of
    buffers to strings (according to the ACPI specification)
    are as follows:
    
    ToDecimalString - explicit byte-wise conversion of buffer
    to string of decimal values (0-255) separated by commas.
    
    ToHexString - explicit byte-wise conversion of buffer to
    string of hex values (0-FF) separated by commas.
    
    ToString - explicit byte-wise conversion of buffer to
    string.  Byte-by-byte copy with no transform except NULL
    terminated.  Any other implicit buffer-to-string conversion
    
    byte-wise conversion of buffer to string of hex values
    (0-FF) separated by spaces.
    
    Fixed a problem in acpi_ns_get_pathname_length where the
    returned length was one byte too short in the case of a
    node in the root scope.  This could cause a fault during
    debug output.

    [PATCH] USB ehci: handle earlier endpoint_disable()
    
    The recent patch to scrub out ep0 state earlier (to get rid of some of
    the enumeration problems that started with about 2.6.6) requires EHCI
    to handle endpoint_disable() calls in a slightly different context.
    
    This makes those calls work when an endpoint's QH may still be on the
    async schedule, rather than already unlinked.  (The QH stays on the async
    schedule for a few milliseconds after it's empty, since it's routine to
    issue another request almost immediately.)

    Change the behaviour of netem's delayed packets queue to make it work better

    Now, packets are put in the delayed queue and held there until the next timer interval,
    then moved to the underlying qdisc. qlen is set to match the available packets in
    the underlying discipline (and not count those waiting). Previously, netem would perturb
    the rate control disciplines because of rescheduling and moving packets in
    the dequeue handler.

    [PATCH] USB device init: implement the Windows scheme
    
    This patch implements the Windows scheme for USB device initialization.
    It also incorporates the change recently posted by David to scrub the
    endpoint state following a SET-ADDRESS.  Other noteworthy changes:
    
    	There are two new module parameters to control whether the
    	old scheme or the new one is used first and whether the other
    	scheme is tried if the first one fails.  Default settings are
    	to use the new scheme only.
    
    	hub_set_address() returns 0 immediately if the device is already
    	in the USB_STATE_ADDRESS state.
    
    	On the first attempt to read the device descriptor the code
    	uses a short 1-second timeout.  This ought to help prevent
    	full-speed devices with an 8- or 16-byte maxpacket from
    	slowing the procedure down by NAKing the unexpectedly early
    	status stage of the transfer.
    
    	For debugging, the ep0 maxpacket value is printed.  It might
    	be a good idea to validate it rather than just believing the
    	device -- although I haven't heard of any device providing
    	an incorrect value other than 0.

    [PATCH] Fix PREEMPT_ACTIVE definition
    
    When the generic IRQ stuff went in, it seems that HARDIRQ_BITS got bumped
    from 9 (for ppc64) up to 12.  Consequently, the PREEMPT_ACTIVE bit is now
    within HARDIRQ_MASK, and I get in_interrupt() falsely returning true when
    PREEMPT_ACTIVE is set, and thus a BUG_ON tripping in arch/ppc64/mm/tlb.c.
    
    The patch below fixes this by changing PREEMPT_ACTIVE to 0x10000000.  I
    have changed the PREEMPT_ACTIVE definitions for each of the architectures
    that define CONFIG_GENERIC_HARDIRQS (i386, ppc, ppc64, x86_64) and fixed
    the comment in include/linux/hardirq.h.  We could perhaps move the
    PREEMPT_ACTIVE definition to include/linux/hardirq.h - I don't know why it
    is still per-arch.

    [PATCH] PPC64 remove __ioremap_explicit() error message
    
    This patch, from John Rose, is the counterpart of one recently
    forwarded by Greg KH.  It has the same description, but isn't the same
    patch - this is the arch/ppc64 part of the change.
    
    As an unfortunate side effect of runtime addition/removal of PCI Host Bridges,
    the RPA DLPAR driver can no longer depend on the success of ioremap_explicit()
    (and therefore remap_page_range()) for the case of DLPAR adding an I/O Slot.
    
    Without addressing this, an attempt to add the first child slot of a newly
    added PHB will fail when __ioremap_explicit() determines the mappings for that
    range to already exist.
    
    For a little context, __ioremap_explicit() creates mappings for the range of a
    newly added slot.  Here's why these calls will be expected to fail in some
    cases.  Keep in mind that at boot-time, the PPC64 kernel calls ioremap() for
    the entire range spanned by each PHB.  Consider the following scenarios of
    DLPAR-adding an I/O slot.
    
    1) Just after boot, one removes an I/O slot.  At this point the range
       associated with the parent PHB is fragmented, and the child range for the
       slot in question is iounmap()'ed.  One then re-adds the slot, at which point
       remap_page_range()/ioremap_explicit() restores the mappings that were
       previously removed.
    
    2) One adds a new PHB, at which point the ppc64-specific addition ioremaps the
       entire PHB range.  One then performs a DLPAR-add of a child slot of that
       PHB.  At this point, mappings already exist for the range of the slot to
       be added.  So remap_page_range()/ioremap_explicit() will fail at this point.
    
    The problem is, there's not a good way to distinguish between cases 1 and 2
    from the perspective of the DLPAR driver.  Because of that, I believe the
    correct solution to be:
    
    - Removal of relevant error prints from iounmap_explicit(), which is only used
      for DLPAR.
    - Removal of error code checks from the RPA driver
    
    Here's the first of these.

    [NET]: Add new sysfs attribute 'carrier' for net devices.
    
    From: Jesper Juhl <juhl-lkml@dif.dk>
    
    The patch adds a new sysfs attribute called carrier for net devices that
    exposes the result of netif_carrier_ok().  This allows a user to quickly
    and easily determine if a given netdevice has carrier or not.  Reading
    /sys/class/net/<interface>/carrier yields a '1' when there is a carrier and
    a '0' when there is not.

          * fix some races that showed up on OMAP-1510
    
          * tracking down annoying PIO-OUT lossage and making double buffering
            start to behave (needed as fallback if all DMA channels are in use).

    [PATCH] USB: usb/hcd kconfig updates
    
    This updates the dependencies of the HCDs and host-side USB so that:
    
     - Options for PCI-only HCDs (UHCI and, for now, EHCI) only appear
       systems that actually have PCI.
    
     - Adding non-PCI bus glue support for another OHCI adapter doesn't
       need involve changing the main USB Kconfig anymore.
    
     - Minor tweaks to the OMAP support, so OMAP 17xx and 24xx don't need
       additional Kconfig changes and so the H3/17xx gets the ISP1301 too.
    
    This still tries to hide host-side USB config options on systems that
    don't offer USB.  While currently convenient, that's a losing proposition
    in the long term:  host controllers on chips like SL811 and TD243 can be
    put onto any custom board.

    This is a bunch of "sparse" fixes for goku_udc.  One of these might be
    an issue on some systems for code that explicitly halts IN endpoints
    (like file_storage) if normal memory access doesn't work for PCI.

    [PATCH] ppp: terminate connection on hangup
    
    I reviewed, patched, and tested ppp_async.c to implement
    ldisc->hangup().  This correctly terminates the PPP connection on
    hangup.
    
    Paul Mackerras already did an excellent job of ensuring safe shutdown
    and I/O completion in ldisc->close so the change is trivial: just add
    the ldisc->hangup and call the existing close routine.

    [PATCH] smbfs protocol fixes
    
    From: <Urban.Widmark@enlight.net>
    
    The memset is because it was previously possible to send always the same CIFS
    fragment and use this to increase the data counters.  When the data counter
    "exceeds" the amount of bytes expected this will return the buffer only
    partially initialised...  With findfirst etc requests this should allow
    leaking kernel memory content.
    
    The other thing is that the data is only returned when data_tot and parm_tot
    both "exceed" the expected values.  Previously it was possible to create a
    sequence of CIFS fragments that allowed exceeding the counters.  The calling
    functions then would believe they received a number of bytes that does not fit
    into the allocated buffer.

    [PATCH] x86_64: no TIOCSBRK/TIOCCBRK in ia32 emulation
    
    In ia32 emulation, the amd64 kernel refuses the ioctls TIOCSBRK and
    TIOCCBRK with EINVAL.  I've attached a patch that adds them to the
    compatibility list.
    
    Since all architectures have these ioctls ("m68knommu" inherits them from
    "m68k", "um" from its host) and use the same code, I think adding them to
    compat_ioctl.h is the correct choice (as opposed to adding them to
    arch/x86_64/ia32/ia32_ioctl.c).

    When the generic IRQ patch went in, it changed the behaviour of setup_irq

    controller has a startup function, and so we weren't getting any interrupts
    through the XICS because they never got enabled.  This patch adds a call to
    xics_enable_irq to xics_startup and fixes the problem.

    Update tty layer to not mix kernel and user pointers.
    
    Instead, tty_io.c will always copy user space data to
    kernel space, leaving the drivers to worry only about
    normal kernel buffers.
    
    No more "from_user" flag, and having the user copy in
    each driver.
    
    This cleans up the code and also fixes a number of
    locking bugs.

    MTD: NOR flash chip driver updates
    
    Mostly from Eric Biederman for supporting BIOS flash.
    
        - Move support firmware hub style lock and unlock into fhw_lock.h (from cfi_cmdset_0002)
        - Move cfi_varsize_frob into cfi_util from cfi_cmdset_0001.c and cfi_cmdset_0002.c
        - reduce gen_probe probe failuers to a debug level message
        - Modify cfi_fixup to take a struct mtd_info instead of a struct map_info
          So that the fixup routines can modify the mtd functions.
        - Modify cfi_cmdset_0001() to allocate and initialize the mtd structure
          before calling cfi_fixup.
        - Modify cfi_cmdset_0002() to allocate and initialize the mtd structure
          before calling cfi_fixup.
        - Refactor the hard coded fixups in cfi_cmdset_0001 and cfi_cmdset_0002
          so the improved cfi_fixup infrastructure.
        - Rewrote amd76xrom and ichxrom.
          They now report their starting physical address in their name.
          They now both handle multiple bankwidth configurations
          They both can create multipe mtd devices.
          They both now assume the rom windows are properly opened by the BIOS
           or whatever runs previous to them.
          Their code is now synchromized so it is almost identical,
             and could be a starting point for a x86_rom_probe.

    MTD char device access -- return data when ECC errors happen.
    
    This is sane, as the driver returns the real data and the return
    value is for information of NAND aware filesystems. Userspace
    access to raw NAND is usually restricted to debugging tools which
    are aware of the NAND specific problems.

    Shared Reed-Solomon ECC library
    
    The attached patch contains a shared Reed-Solomon Library analogous to
    the shared zlib.
    
    (N)AND FLASH is gaining popularity and there are a lot of ASIC/SoC/FPGA
    controllers around which implement hardware support for Reed-Solomon
    error correction. As usual they use different implementations
    (polynomials etc.). So it's obvious to use a shared library for the
    common tasks of error correction.
    
    A short scan through the kernel revealed that at least the ftape driver
    uses Reed-Solomon error correction. It could be easily converted to use
    the shared library code.
    
    The encoder/decoder code is lifted from the GPL'd userspace RS-library
    written by Phil Karn. I modified/wrapped it to provide the different
    functions which we need in the MTD/NAND code.
    
    The library is tested in extenso under various MTD/NAND configurations.
    
    The lib should be usable for other purposes right out of the box.
    Adjustment for currently not implemented functionality is an easy task.
    
    I'm willing to take the maintainership of the library.

    [IA64-SGI] sparse cleanups & misc fixes for sn2
    
    This is a big patch mostly because I trimmed shub_mmr.h down from 17M to 11k
    or so.  It fixes a number of things sparse discovered and removes some dead
    code, fixes up some prototypes, etc.  Of note:
    
    o sn_proc_fs.c was directly dereferencing user pointers, fixed
    o sn_hwperf.c was missing an include and was using asm-ia64 directly
    o the I/O routines were all missing proper sparse annotations
    o dead code in prominfo_proc.c has been removed
    o fix generic build by putting numionodes into asm/sn/io.h
    
    With this patch applied, the check build is pretty clean.  The sn_console bit
    depends on some of the other changes, so it's included here.

    [IA64] top level scheduler domain for ia64
    
    Some have noticed that the overlapping sched domains code doesn't quite work
    as intended (it results in disjoint domains on some machines), and that a top
    level, machine spanning domain is needed.  This patch from John Hawkes adds
    it to the ia64 code.  This allows processes to run on all CPUs in large
    systems, though balancing is limited.  It should go to Linus soon now
    otherwise large systems will only have ~16p (depending on topology) usable by
    the scheduler.  I sanity checked it on a small system after rediffing John's
    original, and he's done some testing on very large systems.
    
     Nick, can you buy off on the sched.c change?  Alternatively, do you want to
     send that fix separately John? Nick did indeed ACK this change, but it isn't
     dependent on this ia64 specific part ... so it's going to be submitted
     separately.

    [NETFILTER]: Avoid warning on CONNTRACK_STAT_INC in death_by_timeout()
    
    Module removal can call death_by_timeout() manually, which isn't in softirq
    context, so the CONNTRACK_STAT_INC() call there (which assumes preempt
    disabled) can give a warning.  Of course, the warning here is spurious, but
    the simplest workaround is to call CONNTRACK_STAT_INC() inside the lock.

    [ARM] Add seqlocking to timers.
    
    Sometimes, it's useful to have locking.  Especially when we're
    talking about time keeping.
    
    It would appear that shemminger's patch of 5th February 2003
    completely missed updating _ANY_ ARM timer implementations and,
    because linux-arch didn't exist at the time, there appears to
    have been no notification to any architecture developer that
    maybe, just maybe, some work was required.
    
    One wonders how many other changes are in the kernel which
    architecture maintainers have missed.

    [PATCH] UHCI: No bandwidth reclamation during enumeration
    
    A few devices prefer not to have full-speed bandwidth reclamation turned
    on while they are being enumerated.  In particular this seems to be true
    for the USB Bluetooth adapters built in to some laptop models (used for
    remote keyboards).  This patch alters the UHCI driver so that control URBs
    for devices still in the USB_STATE_DEFAULT state will be placed on the
    low-speed queue rather than the full-speed queue.  Since the low-speed
    queue isn't subject to bandwidth reclamation the devices will work
    properly.  The negative impact on other devices is minimal; the process of
    device initialization will be slowed down by a few milliseconds.

    [PATCH] USB: usb suspend support for hid-core
    
    Basic HID driver support for USB suspend/resume.  At least one keyboard
    works OK as a remote wakeup source ... unless you write the sysfs
    power/state attribute using that USB keyboard, in which case the input
    subsystem reports an endless stream of newlines!  :)
    
    Someone still needs to implement some configurable timer to support the
    "suspend idle mice/keyboards/..." policy for devices that can issue
    wakeup events.  In conjunction with autosuspend policies in hub and
    HCD (UHCI) code, that could allegedly save 2W of power by enabling the
    C3 state on Centrino laptops that use USB mice.

    [PATCH] USB Storage: Fix queuecommand() for disconnected devices
    
    Following the recommendation of James Bottomley (of SCSI fame), this patch
    changes the queuecommand() routine so that when a command is received for a
    disconnected device, instead of accepting the command and then ignoring it,
    we fail the command immediately with DID_NO_CONNECT.
    
    This fixes a timeout-abort-oops sequence that would occur when the
    higher-level drivers (mostly the CD driver) try to queue a SYNCHRONIZE
    CACHE command during scsi_remove_host().

    [IA64] Avoid a rare deadlock during unwind
    
    There is a rare deadlock condition during unwind script creation.  If
    build_script() is interrupted in the middle of creating the script, it
    holds the script write lock.  If the interrupt handler needs to call
    unwind for some failure condition, unwind will try to read the
    incomplete script and will deadlock on the script lock.
    
    The fix is to disable interrupts while building the script, so
    interrupt handlers never see partial scripts.
    
    Promoting spin_lock_irqsave() from script_new() to find_save_locs()
    changes the indentation, so the patch looks bigger than it really is.

    [PATCH] ext3 directio block leak fix
    
    The orphan list holds inodes that need to be truncated on recovery.  In the
    O_DIRECT case, it's used if we extend the inode --- the truncate on recovery
    means we'll recover the newly-allocated disk blocks if we crash after the IO
    starts but before i_size is updated on disk.
    
    Now, the orphan list is *also* used to delete inodes that are unlinked but
    still-open.  Those get truncated but also deleted on recovery.
    
    The orphan list is held both in memory and on disk.  So the rules are that the
    inode can't be reclaimed while on the orphan list.  There are only two cases
    --- either the inode is actively being written(O_DIRECT) or truncated (in
    which case the inode is by definition not going to be reused), or it's
    unlinked but still open (again, non-reclaimable).
    
    But in the case where you're truncating or write(O_DIRECT)ing a file that is
    *ALSO* unlinked, there's a problem --- the final unlink would put the inode on
    the orphan list, but the write/truncate would try to add/remove it.  End
    result is that the inode disappears from the orphan list while it's still
    unlinked-but-in-use.
    
    That's just a leak-on-crash, it's not going to be detectable in normal use.
    But it's still a bug, and the way we fix it is for direct-IO and truncate not
    to do the ext3_orphan_del if the file is unlinked (ie.  i_nlink==0).

    [PATCH] nfs4 lease: add a lock manager copy lock callback
    
    The following patches provide an interface to the lease subsystem in the
    current VFS locking code.  NFSv4 delegations and Samba op-locks share most
    architecture features.  The version 4 NFS server delegation implementation
    should use leases to co-ordinate behavior between local, Samba, and NFS
    access.
    
    
    The main design points are
    
    - Seperate the fcntl interface from the file_lock FL_LEASE processing in
      fcntl_setlease, creating __setlease() called by fcntl_setlease()
    
    - Add new lock_manager callbacks to enable lease properties to be set,
      leases to be broken, and leases to be cleaned up: with default callbacks
      preserving the current fcntl_setlease properties.
    
    - Add a new interface, setlease() which also calls __setlease(), and
      remove_lease() for kernel lease managers (e.g.  the v4 NFS server)
    
    
    This patch:
    
    Add a lock manager copy lock callback to locks_copy_lock() so that nfsd can
    set lease properties.

    [PATCH] transmeta efficeon support and cpuid update
    
    This patch adds efficeon as a cpu option, and makes a small update to the
    transmeta cpuid code.  (i wasn't sure if the various doc files are UTF-8...
    if they are, then the e should be a U-275 ;)
    
    The compile options may not be ideal, but they're probably close.  i used
    -march=pentium3, but -march=pentium4 would have been good enough too.
    
    The cpuid update teaches transmeta.c about the extended processor revision
    present in cpuid level 0x80860002...  the external documentation does not
    indicate how to break apart this field, and instructs only that the 32-bit
    value should be printed in hex (alas).

    [PATCH] "console=" parameter ignored
    
    I've noticed that under specific circumstances the "console=" kernel
    parameter is ignored.  This happens when EARLY_PRINTK is enabled and the
    serial console is the only available.  In this case unregister_console()
    when called for the early console sets preferred_console back to -1
    replacing the value that was recorded by console_setup() -- the order of
    calls is as follows:
    
    1. register_console() -- for the early console,
    
    2. console_setup() -- recording the console index for the real console,
    
    3. unregister_console() -- for the early console, erasing the console
       index recorded above,
    
    4. register_console() -- for the real console, picking up the first device
       available, instead of the selected one.
    
    I've observed this problem with a DECstation system using ttyS3 -- its
    default console device from the firmware's point of view.
    
    The solution is to restore the setting of "console=" upon
    unregister_console().  This made a snapshot of 2.4.26 work for me.  I
    wasn't able to test the changes with 2.6 because DECstation drivers don't
    support it yet, but the code responsible for console selection appears
    functionally the same.  So I've concluded it needs the same change.  Here's
    a patch.

    [PATCH] lockd: remove hardcoded maximum NLM cookie length
    
    At the moment, the NLM cookie length is fixed to 8 bytes, while 1024 is the
    theoretical maximum.  FreeBSD uses 16 bytes, Mac OS X uses 20 bytes.
    Therefore we need to make the length dynamic (which I set to 32 bytes).
    
    This patch is based on an old patch for Linux 2.4.23-pre9, which I changed
    to patch properly (also added some stylish NIPQUAD fixes).
    
    From: Neil Brown <neilb@cse.unsw.edu.au>
    
    Further lockd tidyups.
      - NIPQUAD everywhere that is appropriate
      - use XDR_QUADLEN in more places as appropriate
      - discard QUADLEN which is a lockd-specific version of XDR_QUADLEN

    [PATCH] slab: reduce fragmentation due to kmem_cache_alloc_node
    
    Attached is a patch that fixes the fragmentation that Badri noticed with
    kmem_cache_alloc_node.
    
    kmem_cache_alloc_node tries to allocate memory from a given node. The
    current implementation contains two bugs:
    
    - the node aware code was used even for !CONFIG_NUMA systems.  Fix:
      inline function that redefines kmem_cache_alloc_node as kmem_cache_alloc
      for !CONFIG_NUMA.
    
    - the code always allocated a new slab for each new allocation.  This
      caused severe fragmentation.  Fix: walk the slabp lists and search for a
      matching page instead of allocating a new page.
    
    - the patch also adds a new statistics field for node-local allocs.  They
      should be rare - the codepath is quite slow, especially compared to the
      normal kmem_cache_alloc.

    [PATCH] idefloppy: suppress media not present errors
    
    Below is a patch to suppress printing uninformative errors from
    ide-floppy.c in response to commands to floppy drives in which no media is
    present.
    
    Without this patch, commands sent to ide-floppy devices without media
    inserted cause error messages on the console (KERN_ERR level) such as:
    
    ide-floppy: ide: I/O error, pc = 0 key = 2, asc = 3a asq = 0
    ide-floppy: ide: I/O error, pc = 1b key = 2, asc = 3a asq = 0
    ide-floppy: ide: I/O error, pc = 23 key = 2, asc = 3a asq = 0
    ide-floppy: ide: I/O error, pc = 1e key = 2, asc = 3a asq = 0
    ide-floppy: ide: I/O error, pc = 1e key = 2, asc = 3a asq = 0
    
    Dell's Virtual Floppy (system management presents to the local system an
    IDE floppy device, which is actually a floppy device in a remote system
    connected over an IP link) exhibits this also, when connecting to a remote
    floppy drive with no media present.

    [PATCH] EDD: use EXTENDED READ command, add CONFIG_EDD_SKIP_MBR
    
    Some controller BIOSes have problems with the legacy int13 fn02 READ
    SECTORS command.  int13 fn42 EXTENDED READ is used in preference by most
    boot loaders today, so lets use that.  If EXTENDED READ fails or isn't
    supported, fall back to READ SECTORS.
    
    This hopefully resolves the three reports of BIOSes which would either
    long-pause (30+ seconds) or hang completely on the legacy READ SECTORS
    command.
    
    This also adds CONFIG_EDD_SKIP_MBR to eliminate reading the MBR on each
    BIOS-presented disk, in case there are further problems in this area.

    [PATCH] hvc_console fix to prevent oops and late hangup and write operations
    
    This patch prevents execution of hvc_write() and hvc_hangup() after the tty
    layer has executed a final hvc_close() against a device.  This patch
    provides a better method than was previously used.  tty->driver_data is no
    longer invalidated so we'll no longer get oopses when the tty layer allows
    late hangup() and write() operations.
    
    - Removed silly tty->driver_data = NULL; from hvc_close which prevents
      possible oops in hvc_write() and hvc_hangup() due to improperly acting
      ldisc close ordering.
    
    - Added hp->count <= 0 check to hvc_write() and hvc_hangup() to prevent
      execution of these function after hvc_close() has been invoked by the tty
      layer.  Same tty ldisc issues as above are the reason.
    
    - Added some comments to clarify the situation.
    
    - Awaiting a forth coming patch from Alan Cox which should clean up the
      close ordering and prevent the late hangup and write ops from happening.

    [PATCH] firmware_class: avoid double free

    risk is that the caller will pass this to release_firmware, a double free.
    This is exactly what will happen if the caller copied the example code
    
             if(request_firmware(&fw_entry, $FIRMWARE, device) == 0)

    [PATCH] Amifb: use new amifb:off logic to enhance audio experience
    
    Amiga frame buffer: We used to have a local hack in fbmem.c to always call the
    fbdev setup() routines, even when an fbdev was explicitly disabled on the
    kernel command line (video=xxx:off).  This allowed amifb to suspend the
    monitor, but program the sync generator of the video controller in Denise/Lisa
    to a 31 kHz/70 Hz mode, increasing the maximum audio playback frequency.
    Thanks to the recently introduced fb_get_options() routine, we can kill the
    local hack and just use the return value of fb_get_options().

    [PATCH] M68k: don't emit empty stack program header in vmlinux
    
    Recent versions of ld add an empty stack program header to the kernel image,
    which makes it incompatible with current m68k bootstrap loaders.  Modify the
    linker script to make sure we see only the program headers that are really
    needed.  (from Roman Zippel)

    Kirill's kernel/pid.c rework broke optimization logic in detach_pid().  Non
    zero return from __detach_pid() was used to indicate, that this pid can
    probably be freed.  Current version always (modulo idle threads) return non
    zero value, thus resulting in unneccesary pid_hash scanning.
    
    Also, uninlining __detach_pid() reduces pid.o text size from 2492 to 1600

    [PATCH] Posix compliant cpu clocks
    
    POSIX clocks are to be implemented in the following way according
    to V3 of the Single Unix Specification:
    
    1. CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID
    
      Implementations shall also support the special clockid_t value
      CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID, which represents the CPU-time clock of the
      calling process when invoking one of the clock_*() or timer_*()
      functions. For these clock IDs, the values returned by clock_gettime() and
      specified by clock_settime() represent the amount of execution time of the
      process associated with the clock.
    
    2. CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID
    
      Implementations shall also support the special clockid_t value
      CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID, which represents the CPU-time clock of the
      calling thread when invoking one of the clock_*() or timer_*()
      functions. For these clock IDs, the values returned by clock_gettime()
      and specified by clock_settime() shall represent the amount of
      execution time of the thread associated with the clock.
    
    These times mentioned are CPU processing times and not the time that has
    passed since the startup of a process. Glibc currently provides its own
    implementation of these two clocks which is designed to return the time
    that passed since the startup of a process or a thread.
    
    Moreover Glibc's clocks are bound to CPU timers which is problematic when the
    frequency of the clock changes or the process is moved to a different
    processor whose cpu timer may not be fully synchronized to the cpu timer
    of the current CPU. This patchset results in a both clocks working reliably.
    
    The patch also implements the access to other the thread and process clocks
    of linux processes by using negative clockid's:
    
    1. For CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID: -pid
    2. For CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID: -(pid + PID_MAX_LIMIT)
    
    This allows
    
    clock_getcpuclockid(pid) to return -pid
    
    and
    
    pthread_getcpuiclock(pid) to return -(pid + PID_MAX_LIMIT)
    
    to allow access to the corresponding clocks.
    
    Todo:
    - The timer API to generate events by a non tick based timer is not
      usable in its current state. The posix timer API seems to be only
      useful at this point to define clock_get/set. Need to revise this.
    - Implement timed interrupts in mmtimer after API is revised.
    
    The mmtimer patch is unchanged from V6 and stays as is in 2.6.9-rc3-mm2.
    But I expect to update the driver as soon as the interface to setup hardware
    timer interrupts is usable.

    The following patch will have the committed memory limit (per the current
    overcommit ratio) and the amount of memory remaining under this limit
    displayed in meminfo.
    
    It's presently somewhat difficult to use the strict memory overcommit
    settings as it's somewhat difficult to determine the amount of memory
    remaining under the cap.  This patch would make using strict overcommit a
    good bit simpler.

    [PATCH] nfsd4: move code to truncate on open to separate function
    
    for OPEN with O_TRUNC, if the truncate fails, the open fails.  for
    nfs4_open_upgrade, this means undo the get_write_access.  for new OPENs, this
    means release the newly created stateid.

    Attached is a patch that adds CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE, enabling you to

    It depreciate the INITRAMFS_LIST environment variable introduced not long

    There are some issues (suggestions/patches welcome) that I am not
    sure about:
    1) I put the menu entry under block devices, but I am not sure if
       this is the correct location?
    2) There might be a better (or more correct) way to do this with

    [PATCH] DVB/V4L dependency fix
    
    The problem is that dvb is way to much work-in-progress right now, it's
    almost impossible to build something which works on both mainline kernel +
    latest dvb cvs.  Hope at least the interfaces are settled soon, for now I
    gave up on getting it work in mainline in short-term.
    
    The patch below compiles the DVB card configuration code only when
    VIDEO_CX88_DVB is enabled (which is commented right now in Kconfig due to
    being broken).

    [PATCH] v4l: cx88 driver update
    
    This is a major update of the cx88 driver.  Main new feature is support
    for the MPEG PCI function of the cx2388x chips.  The changes in detail:
    
      * A bunch of code restructions, to allow multiple modules (one per PCI
        function) work on top of the core module.
      * Add a new module with common code for the mpeg PCI function.
      * Add a new module to support mpeg encoder cards (connexant
        "blackbird" reference design).  That one is not much tested yet and
        may have bugs.  They can be easily workarounded by not loading the
        module through, it isn't needed to capture uncompressed video.
      * Add a new module to support DVB cards.  That one is better tested
        than the blackbird one, but it needs additional cutting-edge stuff
        from the dvb project, thats why it is disabled in Kconfig for now.
      * Several cleanups along the way: use kthread, use msleep(), drop some
        2.4.x compatibility code, move insmod options to 2.6 style, ...
      * adapt code to the video-buf changes.
      * suspend fixes.
      * as usual some new tv cards.

    [PATCH] v4l: avoid using struct file ptrs in video-buf
    
    This patch makes the video-buf helper module pass through a void pointer
    instead of a struct file pointer, that makes the code also usable when no
    file pointer is available.  This is needed for when using the video-buf
    infrastructure to manage DMA buffers for DVB cards.
    
    The file pointer was used by the videobuf_queue_ops callbacks to get the
    drivers private data via file->private_data, now a pointer to the drivers's
    private data can be passed directly.
    
    Adaptions of the drivers follow with separate patches.

    [PATCH] lighten mmlist_lock
    
    Let's lighten the global spinlock mmlist_lock.
    
    What's it for?
    1. Its original role is to guard mmlist.
    2. It later got a second role, to prevent get_task_mm from raising
       mm_users from the dead, just after it went down to 0.
    
    Firstly consider the second: __exit_mm sets tsk->mm NULL while holding
    task_lock before calling mmput; so mmlist_lock only guards against the
    exceptional case, of get_task_mm on a kernel workthread which did AIO's
    use_mm (which transiently sets its tsk->mm without raising mm_users) on an
    mm now exiting.
    
    Well, I don't think get_task_mm should succeed at all on use_mm tasks.
    It's mainly used by /proc/pid and ptrace, seems at best confusing for those
    to present the kernel thread as having a user mm, which it won't have a
    moment later.  Define PF_BORROWED_MM, set in use_mm, clear in unuse_mm
    (though we could just leave it), get_task_mm give NULL if set.
    
    Secondly consider the first: and what's mmlist for?
    1. Its original role was for swap_out to scan: rmap ended that in 2.5.27.
    2. In 2.4.10 it got a second role, for try_to_unuse to scan for swapoff.
    
    So, make mmlist a list of mms which maybe have pages on swap: add mm to
    mmlist when first swap entry is assigned in try_to_unmap_one (pageout), or
    in copy_page_range (fork); and mmput remove it from mmlist as before,
    except usually list_empty and there's no need to lock.  drain_mmlist added
    to swapoff, to empty out the mmlist if no swap is then in use.
    
    mmput leave mm on mmlist until after its exit_mmap, so try_to_unmap_one can
    still add mm to mmlist without worrying about the mm_users 0 case; but
    try_to_unuse must avoid the mm_users 0 case (when an mm might be removed
    from mmlist, and freed, while it's down in unuse_process): use
    atomic_inc_return now all architectures support that.
    
    Some of the detailed comments in try_to_unuse have grown out of date:
    updated and trimmed some, but leave SWAP_MAP_MAX for another occasion.

    [PATCH] FAT: rewrite the cache for file allocation table lookup
    
    This rewrites the cache stuff for file allocation table (FAT).
    
    This cache stocks the more pieces of FAT-chain by counting the number
    of contiguous data blocks. And if cache hit, since a block number can
    calculate without looking FAT-chain up, fat_get_block() become more
    fast.

    Ignore all ACPI timer overrides on all Nvidia boards.  The fallback doesn't

    it anyways.

    [PATCH] module_param_array() should take a pointer
    
    module_param_array() takes a variable to put the number of elements in.
    Looking through the uses, many people don't care, so they declare a dummy
    or share one variable between several parameters.  The latter is
    problematic because sysfs uses that number to decide how many to display.
    
    The solution is to change the variable arg to a pointer, and if the pointer
    is NULL, use the "max" value.  This change is fairly small, but fixing up
    the callers is a lot of (trivial) churn.

    Hardware Environment: AMD64, sil3512 controller on m/b.  Harddrive: Seagate
    120GB ST3120026AS
    
    Problem Description: Drive would lock when writing large files, eg video
    from firewire, audio editing.  Checked dmesg, was obviously the sata drive.
    
    Have added the drive to the blacklist in sata_sil.c and the problem seems
    to have disappeared.
    
    Is there a good test to verify that the mod15 bug is really the problem?

    [IA64-SGI] Distribute useage of BTE interfaces.
    
    During peak utilization periods, the first interface on a node has
    an inordinately large amount of contention.  This is due to all

    that based upon the slice the requesting cpu is attached to.

    [IA64-SGI] Double spin_unlock in bte.c
    
    If all bte interfaces are in use, the current code will leave the
    bte pointer set when exiting from the loop trying to locate an
    interface to use.  This results in two processes using the same
    interface and both trying to free the same one.  With a
    premptible kernel, this results in the preempt count getting
    off.

    Please note that I've left the CONFIG_IPV6 defines in as to support
    ipv6 modules we'll need to modularise tcpdiag itself.  I'll probably
    do that after this is all fixed.

    [PKT_SCHED]: CBQ; Destroy filters before destroying classes.
    
    CBQ destroys its classes by traversing the hashtable and thus classes
    are not destroyed from root to leafs which means that class Y being
    a subclass of class X may be destroyed before X. This is a problem
    if a filter is attached to class X (parent) classifying into class Y
    (result). In case Y gets deleted before X the filter references an
    already deleted class while trying to unbind (cbq_unbind_filter).
    Therefore all filters must be destroyed before destroying classes. An
    additional BUG_TRAP has been added to document this not so obvious case.
    
    The BUG can be triggered with the following commands:
     qdisc add dev  root handle 10:0 cbq bandwidth 100Mbit avpkt 1400 mpu 64
     class add dev  parent 10:0  classid 10:12 cbq bandwidth 100mbit        rate 100mbit allot 1514 prio 3 maxburst 1 avpkt  500 bounded
     class add dev  parent 10:12  classid 10:13 cbq bandwidth 100mbit        rate 100mbit allot 1514 prio 3 maxburst 1 avpkt  500 bounded
     filter add dev  parent 10:12 protocol ip prio 10 u32 match ip protocol 6 0xff flowid 10:13
     qdisc del dev  root
    
    The deletion ordering in the above case is: 10:0 -> 10:13 -> 10:12

    Some serial drivers receive their serial port device information via
    the device model.  This unfortunately means that the selected port
    may not be available when the console subsystem initialises, so we
    must keep trying to register the console after each port is added.

    [PATCH] I2C: Fourth auto-fan control interface proposal
    
    Here comes my fourth (and hopefully last) sysfs interface proposal for
    implementing auto-fan control in 2.6. Previous proposals have been
    discussed here:
    
    [1] http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg07517.html
    [2] http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg08049.html
    [3] http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg18008.html
    
    The interface is still made up of two parts: per fan temp channels
    selection, and trip points selection. Changes from the third proposal:
    
    pwm[1-*]_enable value 2 is now used to explicitely state the auto pwm
    mode. This was proposed by Mark D. Studebaker [4].
    
    [4] http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg18011.html
    
    Temp channels selection
    =======================
    
    Renamed files from fan[1-*]_auto_channels to
    pwm[1-*]_auto_channels_temp. The change from fan tp pwm is to match the
    recent renaming suggested by Mark M. Hoffman [5]. The "_temp" suffix is
    to leave some room for a "_fan" suffix at a later time if new chips
    drive auto pwm according to fan speeds instead of temperature.
    
    [5] http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg18797.html
    
    Trip points
    ===========
    
    Trip points are now numbered (point1, point2, etc...) instead of named
    (_off, _min, _max, _full...). This solves the problem of various chips
    having a different number of trip points. The interface is still chip
    independent in that it doesn't require chip-specific knowledge to be
    used by user-space apps.
    
    The reason for this change is that newer chips tend to have more trip
    points. the LM63 has 8, the LM93 has no less than 12. Also, I read in
    the LM63 datasheet that ideal pwm vs temperature curve were parabolic in
    shape. Seems hard to achieve this if we arbitrarily lock the number of
    trip points to 3 ;)
    
    I also introduced an optional hysteresis temperature for trip points.
    The LM63 has this. Since it makes full sense I'd expect other chips to
    propose this as well.
    
    As before, there are two sets of files, each chip driver picks the one
    matching its internal model: trip points are either temperature
    channel-dependent (ADM1031...) or pwm channel-dependent (IT87xx...). If
    we ever come accross fan speed-driven pwm outputs where trip points are
    fan channel-dependent we may have to offer a third set of files. We'll
    see when/if this happens.
    
    I hope I have taken everyone's comments and advice into account and we
    can make this interface proposal part of the sysfs interface standard
    now. I'm sorry it took so long. Comments welcome.

    [PATCH] I2C: Spare 1 byte in lm90 driver
    
    I just noticed the other day that the lm90 driver uses an u16 to store
    the value of the 8-bit alarms register. This is most probably due to the
    fact that I originally copied the lm90 driver from the lm83 driver,
    which actually has two 8-bit registers for alarms, and obviously forgot
    to change the variable type.

    [ide] add ide_hwif_t->dma_setup()
    
    * tag REQ_DRIVE_TASKFILE write requests with REQ_RW
    * split off ->dma_setup() from ->ide_dma_[read,write] functions
    * use ->dma_setup() directly in ATAPI drivers and remove media
      checks from ->ide_dma_[read,write]
    * ->ide_dma_[read,write,begin] cannot fail now
    * in Etrax ide.c setup DMA for ATAPI devices before sending
      command to drive (so setup order is the same as for disks)

    [ARM] Sanitise Footbridge machine class.
    
    Footbridge was suffering from a little lack of care and attention;
    it still had the nasty arch.c file with all the associated #ifdef

    Re-jig footbridge support so that each machine type contains all
    the necessary support code, with a separate common implementation
    which they all share.

    [ARM] Rehash iwmmxt signal handling.
    
    In the near future, VFP will want to save state onto the user stack.
    Therefore, separate out the iwmmxt specific parts, and implement
    a generic "safe copy to user space using random CPU instructions".
    This is necessary because iwmmxt and VFP both use special CPU
    instructions to load and/or save their state.

    [NETFILTER]: Enable ip6t_LOG.c to work without skb_linearize()
    
    This patch enables ip6t_LOG.c to work without skb_linearize().
    
    I changed a large part of this file. At first, ip6_nexthdr() is deleted
    to prevent multiple call of skb_header_pointer() at dump_packet() and
    ip6_nexthdr().
    
    And the following bugs are fixed. The first bug is fixed by introducing
    skb_header_pointer(), then I didn't separate patches.
    
        - No check with skb->len. Then invalid memory access may occur.
    
        - If packet is fragmented and it's not first fragment, nonexistent
          extension headers is tried to parse.
    
        - All headers which aren't TCP/UDP/ICMPv6 are treated as IPv6
          extension header.
    
        - The encrypted data after ESP is tried to parse.
    
        - ntohl() for ID in Fragment header is missing.
    
        - If doff*4 of TCP header is less than sizeof(struct tcphdr),
          TCP options are tried to parse.

    [NETFILTER]: prearation of removing skb_linearize()
    
    This patch uses skb_header_pointer() so that packets can be parsed even though
    skb_linearize() doesn't exist. But this patch doesn't remove skb_linearize()
    yet. We can remove it after changing all match/target modules.
    
    Moreover ...
        - I deleted the optimization not to parse IPv6 extension header
          many time from previous patch. I'll send the patch to do this
          separately.
        - fixed the bug that "offset" argument of match functions are always 0.
        - deleted "hdr" and "datalen" argument and added "protoff" argument
          to match functions. "protoff" means the offset to Layer 4 protocol
          header.
        - the argument order of target function is changed likely IPv4 modules.
          This prevents user from meeting kernel panic when they use old
          match modules.
        - changed {tcp,udp,icmp6}_match(). These functions became very similar
          to codes in ip_tables.c again.

    [PATCH] profile: 512x Altix timer interrupt livelock fix
    
    I've been informed that /proc/profile livelocks some systems in the timer
    interrupt, usually at boot.  The following patch attempts to amortize the
    atomic operations done on the profile buffer to address this stability
    concern.  This patch has nothing to do with performance; kernels using
    periodic timer interrupts are under realtime constraints to complete
    whatever work they perform within timer interrupts before the next timer
    interrupt arrives lest they livelock, performing no work whatsoever apart
    from servicing timer interrupts.  The latency of the cacheline bounce for
    prof_buffer contributes to the time spent in the timer interrupt, hence it
    must be amortized when remote access latencies or deviations from fair
    exclusive cacheline acquisition may cause cacheline bounces to take longer
    than the interval between timer ticks.
    
    What this patch does is to create a pair of per-cpu open-addressed
    hashtables indexed by profile buffer slot holding values representing the
    number of pending profile buffer hits for the profile buffer slot.  When
    this hashtable overflows, one iterates over the hashtable accounting each
    of the pairs of profile buffer slots and hit counts to the global profile
    buffer.  Zero is a legitimate profile buffer slot, so zero hit counts
    represent unused hashtable entries.  The hashtable is furthermore protected
    from flush IPI's by interrupt disablement.
    
    In order to flush the pending profile hits for read_profile(), this patch
    flips betweeen the pairs of per-cpu profile buffer by signalling all cpus
    to flip via IPI at the time of read_profile(), followed by doing all the
    work to flush the profile hits from the older per-cpu buffers in the
    context of the caller of read_profile(), with exclusion provided by a
    semaphore ensuring that only one caller of profile_flip_buffers() may
    execute at a time, and using interrupt disablement to prevent buffer flip
    IPI's from altering the hashtables or flip state while an update is in
    progress.  The flip state is per-cpu so that remote cpus need only disable
    interrupts locally for synchronization, which is both simple and
    busywait-free for remote cpus.  The flip states all change in tandem when
    some cpu requests the hashtables be flipped, and the requester waits for
    the completion of smp_call_function() for notification that all cpus have
    finished flipping between their hashtables.  The IPI handler merely toggles
    the flip state (which is an array index) between 0 and 1.
    
    This is expected to be a much stronger amortization than merely reducing
    the frequency of profile buffer access by a factor of the size of the
    hashtable because numerous hits may be held for each of its entries.  This
    reduces what was before the patch a number of atomic increments equal to
    what after the patch becomes the sum of the hits held for each entry in the
    hashtable, to a number of atomic_add()'s equal to the number of entries in
    the per_cpu hashtable.  This is nondeterministic, but as the profile hits
    tend to be concentrated in a very small number of profile buffer slots
    during any given timing interval, is likely to represent a very large
    number of atomic increments.  This amortization of atomic increments does
    not depend on the hash function, only the sharp peakedness of the
    distribution of profile buffer hits.
    
    This algorithm has two advantages over full-size per-cpu profile buffers.
    The first is that the space footprint is much smaller.  Per-cpu profile
    buffers would increase the space requirements by a factor of
    num_online_cpus(), where this algorithm only requires one page per cpu.
    The second is that reading the profile state is much faster, because the
    state that must be traversed is exactly the above space consumers, and the
    relative reduction in size concomitantly reduces the time required for a
    read operation.
    
    I also took the liberty of adding some commentary to the comments at the
    beginning of the file reflecting the major work done on profile.c in recent
    months and describing what the file implements.
    
    The reporters of this issue have verified that this resolves their timer
    interrupt livelock on 512x Altixen.  In my own testing on 4x logical
    x86-64, this patch saw a rate of about 18 flushes per minute under load, or
    about one flush every 3 seconds, for about 38.4 atomic accesses to the
    profile buffer per second per cpu in one of the algorithm's worst cases,
    about 3.84% of the number of atomic profile buffer accesses per second per
    cpu as a normal kernel would commit.  This represents a twenty-six-fold
    increase in the scalability on SMP systems with 4KB PAGE_SIZE, i.e.  with a
    4KB PAGE_SIZE, the number of atomic profile buffer accesses per second per
    cpu is reduced by a factor of 26, thereby increasing the number of cpus a
    system must have before it would experience a timer interrupt livelock by a
    factor of 26, with the proviso that cacheline bounces must take the same
    amount of time to service.  This increase in the scalability of the kernel
    is expected to be much larger for ia64, which has a large PAGE_SIZE,
    because the distribution of profile buffer hits is so sharply peaked that
    doubling the hashtable size will much more than double the amortization
    factor.  In fact, only 19 flushes were observed on a 64x Altix over an
    approximately 10 minute AIM7 run, and 1 flush on a 512x Altix over the
    course of an entire AIM7 run, for truly vast effective amortization
    factors.
    
    A prior version of this patch, which did not include the node-local
    hashtable allocation and bounded collision chains has been successfully
    tested on 64x and 512x ia64 vs 2.6.9-rc2, 8x ia64 vs.  2.6.9-rc2-mm1, 4x
    x86-64 vs.  2.6.9-rc2-mm1, and 6x sparc64 vs.  2.6.9-rc2-mm1.  This patch
    minus the hashtable initialization fix has been successfully tested on 2x
    ppc64, 2x alpha, 8x ia64, 6x sparc64, and 4x x86-64, all vs.
    2.6.9-rc2-mm1.  This precise version of the patch has been successfully
    tested on 8x ia32 against 2.6.9-rc2-mm1 and 6x sparc64 vs.  both
    2.6.9-rc2-mm1 and 2.6.9-rc2-mm2.

    [PATCH] SELinux: allow all filesystems to specify fscreate mount  option
    
    The patch below allows all types of filesystems to specify the fscreate
    mount option (which is used to specify the security context of the
    filesystem itself).  This was previously only available for filesystems
    with full xattr security labeling, but is also potentially required for
    filesystems with e.g.  psuedo xattr labeling such as devpts and tmpfs.
    
    An example of use is to specify at mount time the fs security context of a
    tmpfs filesystem, overriding the default specified in policy for that
    filesystem.
    
    This patch has been in the Fedora kernel for some weeks with no problems.

    [PATCH] Remove d_bucket
    
    Tested using dcachebench and hevy rename test.
    http://lse.sourceforge.net/locking/dcache/rename_test/
    
    While going over dcache code, I realized that d_bucket which was introduced
    to prevent hash chain traversals from going into an infinite loop earlier,
    is no longer necessary.  Originally, when RCU based lock-free lookup was
    first introduced, dcache hash chains used list_head.  Hash chain traversal
    was terminated when dentry->next reaches the list_head in the hash bucket.
    However, if renames happen during a lock-free lookup, a dentry may move to
    different bucket and subsequent hash chain traversal from there onwards may
    not see the list_head in the original bucket at all.  In fact, this would
    result in the list_head in the bucket interpreted as a list_head in dentry
    and bad things will happen after that.  Once hlist based hash chains were
    introduced in dcache, the termination condition changed and lock-free
    traversal would be safe with NULL pointer based termination of hlists.
    This means that d_bucket check is no longer required.
    
    There still exist some theoritical livelocks like a dentry getting
    continuously moving and lock-free look-up never terminating.  But that
    isn't really any worse that what we have.  In return for these changes, we
    reduce the dentry size by the size of a pointer.  That should make akpm and
    mpm happy.

    [PATCH] Fix dcache lookup
    
    __d_lookup() has leftover stuff from earlier code to protect it against
    rename.  The smp_rmb() there was needed for the sequence counter logic.
    
    Original dcache_rcu had :
    
    +               move_count = dentry->d_move_count;
    +               smp_rmb();
    +
                    if (dentry->d_name.hash != hash)
                            continue;
                    if (dentry->d_parent != parent)
                            continue;
    
    This was to make sure that comparisons didn't happen before before the
    sequence counter was snapshotted.  This logic is now gone and memory
    barrier is not needed.  Removing this should also improve performance.
    
    The other change is the leftover smp_read_barrier_depends(), later
    converted to rcu_dereference().  Originally, the name comparison was not
    protected against d_move() and there could have been a mismatch of
    allocation size of the name string and dentry->d_name.len.  This was
    avoided by making the qstr update in dentry atomic using a d_qstr pointer.
    Now, we do ->d_compare() or memcmp() with the d_lock held and it is safe
    against d_move().  So, there is no need to rcu_dereference() anything.  In
    fact, the current code is meaningless.

    [PATCH] make console_conditional_schedule() __sched and use cond_resched()
    
    Relatively minor add-on (not necessarily tied to it or required to be taken
    or a fix for any bug).  Since cond_resched() is using PREEMPT_ACTIVE now,
    it may be useful to update the open-coded instance of cond_resched() to use
    the generic call.  Also, it should probably be __sched so the caller shows
    up in wchan.

    [PATCH] Incorrect PCI interrupt assignment on ES7000 for platform GSI
    
    In arch/i386/kernel/acpi/boot.c, platform GSI does not propagate back from
    mp_register_gsi() to a calling routine which results in IRQ to be set for
    wrong GSI.  This causes most of the PCI slots on the first PCI module to
    fail.  This patch fixes the problem by returning new GSI back to
    acpi_register_gsi().

    [PATCH] Add VIDIOC_S_CTRL_OLD to matroxfb
    
    For several months I'm receiving complaints from matroxfb users that v4lctl
    suddenly stops working for them on kernel upgrade.
    
    Problem is that VIDIOC_S_CTRL was renumbered, but all distros still use old
    VIDIOC_S_CTRL value (f.e.  even xawtv-3.94 in Debian unstable still uses
    old VIDIOC_S_CTRL definition).
    
    So let's add this old VIDIOC_S_CTRL value (now named VIDIOC_S_CTRL_OLD) to
    matroxfb's v4l handling.

    [PATCH] Remove big-endian mode from matroxfb
    
    One of the PowerPC developers, Kostas Georgiou, pointed out to me
    discussion back from 2001 that they would prefer little endian mode as
    majority of users runs XF4.x and not Xpmac.  And apparently nobody runs
    Xpmac now, so we can safely remove big-endian mode from matroxfb
    completely.
    
      So let's simplify matroxfb a bit:
    
    Accelerator and ILOAD fifo is now always in little endian mode.  This is
    what XFree does.  Due to this change all #ifdefs based on endianness was
    removed from driver - except one which selects framebuffer endinaness (but
    there is no code in matroxfb which writes to framebuffer directly).
    
    It seems that while I was not looking m68k got ioremap, and all
    architectures now offer ioremap and ioremap_nocache.  Let's kill code which
    mapped ioremap_nocache to ioremap, and ioremap to bus_to_virt for
    architectures which did not provide them.
    
    And this also fixes small typo - M_C2CTL should be 0x3C10 and not 0x3E10.
    Apparently Matrox notes about need to program this register during
    initialization are not so important...

    [PATCH] fbcon unimap fix
    
    fbcon doesn't set a unimap at boot time, so special characters come out
    wrongly.
    
    This is the code sequence in take_over_console().
    
    newcon->startup()
    oldcon->deinit()
    newcon->init()
    
    The previous console driver (ie, vgacon), via its deinit method, may release
    the unimap allocated by fbcon in fbcon_startup. This is the reason why
    calling con_set_default_unimap() in fbcon_init() works, but not in
    fbcon_startup().
    
    
    Check if the default display has an allocated unimap, and if it has none,
    call con_set_default_unimap().  And if the target display has no allocated
    unimap, then call con_copy_unimap(), where the source unimap is from the
    default display.

    [PATCH] VGA console font problems on 2.6 kernel
    
    From: Egbert Eich <eich@suse.de>
    
    I would like to utilize kernel ioctls to save/restore console fonts
    in VGA text mode when running X. So far the Xserver takes care of this
    however there more and more problems with this:
            1. On some platforms (IA64) we need to POST the BIOS before
    	   we even have a chance to access the hardware ourselves.
    	   This POSTing will usually undo any changes to the graphics
    	   hardware that the kernel may have done.
    	2. More and more drivers fully rely on BIOS support however
    	   the BIOS functions which could be used to save/restore
    	   register settings may be broken so the only way of mode
    	   save/restore is getting/setting the BIOS mode ID.
    
    I've hacked up some code for X however I ran into two problems:
    
    1. con_font_get() in linux/drivers/char/vt.c seems to be broken as
       the font parameters (height, width, charcount) are never reported
       back. Therefore this function seems to be pretty useless.
       The fix is simple (please see below).
    
    2. fb consoles seem to allow to install fonts per vt so that the user
       can have a different font on every console. The text console driver
       doesn't support this: the font is downloaded to the video card
       and will be used for all systems. Still the vga_con driver stores
       the font parameters per console with the effect that setting a
       font with different parameters on one console will result in the
       wron values when this font information is read back from another
       console.
       Appearantly this broken feature has been introduced in 2.6 as
       in the 2.4 kernel the vga_con font information is stored in one
       single global variable.
    
    The IA64 platform at least still heavily relies on the VGA text console.
    To be able to fix some VT switching issues with X on this platform I
    need these two issues resolved.

      was introduced by the tile blitting patch.
    
    - flashing cursor even when console is blanked

    [PATCH] fbdev: Add Tile Blitting support
    
    Hopefully, this patch fixes one last major regression for one particular
    driver, namely matroxfb.  This drier has 2 versions, one for the kernel and
    another as a '2.4 backport' patch.
    
    This patch adds a tileblitting extension to fbcon.  This extension, in
    summary, is basically a forward-port of the 2.4 fbdev/fbcon framework to 2.6
    but without the fbcon dependency.  Tile blitting is similar to bitblit, except
    that the basic unit is a tile (a bitmap of x-by-y dimensions).  The display,
    instead of being described in terms of pixels and scanlines, are described as
    a region further subdivided into rectangular sections.  In fbcon parlance, a
    tile is a character.
    
    Besides a possible fix for matroxfb, tileblitting can be advantageous for
    hardware that supports some kind of fontcaching mechanism.  Also, in the
    unlikely chance that the console begins supporting multicolored fonts,
    tileblitting is probably more optimal than bitblitting because bitblitting
    will need to push more data through the bus.
    
    To enable support for this extension, a driver needs to:
    
    - enable CONFIG_FB_TILEBLITTING
    - set FBINFO_MISC_TILEBLITTING in info->flags
    - set the required function pointers in struct fb_tileops.  The required
      operations are:
    
      - void (*fb_settile)(struct fb_info *info, struct fb_tilemap *map);
    
        tells driver about the tile characteristics (dimensions, bitdepth) and
        about the tilemap which is an array of bitmaps: display->fontdata
    
      - void (*fb_tilecopy)(struct fb_info *info, struct fb_tilearea *area);
    
        move a rectangular section of tiles (bmove)
    
      - void (*fb_tilefill)(struct fb_info *info, struct fb_tilerect *rect);
    
        fill a rectangular section with a tile (clear)
    
      - void (*fb_tileblit)(struct fb_info *info, struct fb_tileblit *blit);
    
        copy an array of tiles to a rectangular section (putcs)
    
      - void (*fb_tilecursor)(struct fb_info *info, struct fb_tilecursor *cursor);
    
        cursor function
    
    Changes:
    
    Addition of this extension necessitates cleanup of fbcon.c.  The basic drawing
    functions in fbcon are bmove, clear, putcs and cursor (the fbcon_* set).  The
    fbcon_* set are just wrappers to accel_* set.  However, usage is not
    consistent, some functions call the fbcon_* set, others call the accel_* set.
    
    With this patch, a new fbcon-specific structure (struct fbcon_ops) is created.
     Depending on the setting of the hardware, this struct contains pointers to
    either the tileblitting set or the bitblitting set (formerly the accel_* set).
     The tileblitting set is new in this patch.
    
    The vast majority of functions in fbcon will need to only call the fbcon_*
    set.  In turn, it calls functions in struct fbcon_ops.  Knowledge of the
    blitting type is not required.
    
    The accel_* set is renamed to bit_* and is moved into a separate file,
    bitblit.c.  The tile blitting set is in tileblit.c.
    
    In my case at least, the cleanup did produce an unexpected but beneficial
    side effect, a little more speedup.  Not much, < 5%.
    
    Petr, if you have comments, suggestions, or you think this is a bad idea,
    let me know.

    [PATCH] fbdev: Pass struct device to class_simple_device_add
    
    Swsusp turns off the display when a power-management-enabled framebuffer
    driver is used.  According to Nigel Cunningham <ncunningham@linuxmail.org>,
    the fix may involve the following:
    
    "...I thought the best approach would be to use device classes to find the
    struct dev for the frame buffer driver, and then use the same code I use for
    storage devices to avoid suspending the frame buffer until later..."
    
    Changes:
    
    - pass info->device to class_simple_device_add()
    - add struct device *device to struct fb_info
    - store struct device in framebuffer_alloc()
    - for drivers not using framebuffer_alloc(), store the struct during
      initalization
    - port i810fb and rivafb to use framebuffer_alloc()

    [PATCH] fbcon: Fix setup boot options of fbcon
    
    This patch fixes the 'fbcon=map:<option>" of fbcon.  (This option has been
    present since 2.4, but got broken in 2.6). This particular option tells
    fbcon what framebuffer device gets mapped to what console. Syntax is:
    
    	fbcon=map:abcd...
    
    	where a, b, c, d,... are framebuffer numbers as it would
    	appear in /proc/fb.
    
    Given only 2 valid fbdevs, 0 and 1, if fbcon=map:0110, then:
    
    tty1 = fb0
    tty2 = fb1
    tty3 = fb1
    tty4 = fb0
    (sequence repeats for the rest of the consoles)
    
    If an invalid framebuffer is used, then the console will be mapped to the
    first user-chosen framebuffer.  Ie: fbcon=map:102
    
    tty1 = fb1
    tty2 = fb0
    tty3 = fb1 <

    [PATCH] Adjust alignment of pagevec structure
    
    We can shrink the pagevec structure to cacheline align it.  It is used all
    over VM reclaiming and mpage pagecache read code.
    
    Right now it is 140 bytes on 64-bit and 72 bytes on 32-bit.  Thats just a
    little bit more than a power of 2 (which will cacheline align), so shrink
    it to be aligned: 64 bytes on 32bit and 124bytes on 64-bit.
    
    It now occupies two cachelines most of the time instead of three.
    
    I changed nr and cold to "unsigned short" because they'll never reach 2 ^ 16.
    
    Did some reaim benchmarking on 4way PIII (32byte cacheline), with 512MB RAM:

    [PATCH] generic acl support for ->permission
    
    Currently we every filesystem with Posix ACLs has it's own reimplemtation
    of the generic permission checking code with additonal ACL support.  This
    patch
    
    - adds an optional callback to vfs_permission that filesystems can use
      for ACL support (and renames it to generic_permission because the old
      name was wrong - it wasn't like the other vfs_* functions at all)
    
    - uses it in ext2, ext3 and jfs.  XFS will follow a little later as it's
      permission checking is burried under several layers of abstraction.
    
    From: Dave Kleikamp <shaggy@austin.ibm.com>
    
      jfs doesn't currently set MS_POSIXACL (it doesn't require the acl mount
      option), so this test would fail here.  The patch below will set it.

    [PATCH] cfq-v2 I/O scheduler update
    
    Here is the next incarnation of the CFQ io scheduler, so far known as
    CFQ v2 locally. It attempts to address some of the limitations of the
    original CFQ io scheduler (hence forth known as CFQ v1). Some of the
    problems with CFQ v1 are:
    
    - It does accounting for the lifetime of the cfq_queue, which is setup
      and torn down for the time when a process has io in flight. For a fork
      heavy work load (such as a kernel compile, for instance), new
      processes can effectively starve io of running processes. This is in
      part due to the fact that CFQ v1 gives preference to a new processes
      to get better latency numbers. Removing that heuristic is not an
      option exactly because of that.
    
    - It makes no attempts to address inter-cfq_queue fairness.
    
    - It makes no attempt to limit upper latency bound of a single request.
    
    - It only provides per-tgid grouping. You need to change the source to
      group on a different criteria.
    
    - It uses a mempool for the cfq_queues. Theoretically this could
      deadlock if io bound processes never exit.
    
    - The may_queue() logic can be unfair since it fluctuates quickly, thus
      leaving processes sleeping while new processes are allowed to allocate
      a request.
    
    CFQ v2 attempts to fix these issues. It uses the process io_context
    logic to maintain a cfq_queue lifetime of the duration of the process
    (and its io). This means we can now be a lot more clever in deciding
    which process is allowed to queue or dispatch io to the device. The
    cfq_io_context is per-process per-queue, this is an extension to what AS
    currently does in that we truly do have a unique per-process identifier
    for io grouping. Busy queues are sorted by service time used, sub sorted
    by in_flight requests. Queues that have no io in flight are also
    preferred at dispatch time.
    
    Accounting is done on completion time of a request, or with a fixed cost
    for tagged command queueing. Requests are fifo'ed like with deadline, to
    make sure that a single request doesn't stay in the io scheduler for
    ages.
    
    Process grouping is selectable at runtime. I provide 4 grouping
    criterias: process group, thread group id, user id, and group id.
    
    As usual, settings are sysfs tweakable in /sys/block/<dev>/queue/iosched
    
    axboe@apu:[.]s/block/hda/queue/iosched $ ls
    back_seek_max      fifo_batch_expire  find_best_crq  queued
    back_seek_penalty  fifo_expire_async  key_type       show_status
    clear_elapsed      fifo_expire_sync   quantum        tagged
    
    In order, each of these settings control:
    
    back_seek_max
    back_seek_penalty:
    	Useful logic stolen from AS that allow small backwards seeks in
    	the io stream if we deem them useful. CFQ uses a strict
    	ascending elevator otherwise. _max controls the maximum allowed
    	backwards seek, defaulting to 16MiB. _penalty denotes how
    	expensive we account a backwards seek compared to a forward
    	seek. Default is 2, meaning it's twice as expensive.
    
    clear_elapsed:
    	Really a debug switch, will go away in the future. It clears the
    	maximum values for completion and dispatch time, shown in
    	show_status.
    
    fifo_batch_expire
    fifo_batch_async
    fifo_batch_sync:
    	The settings for the expiry fifo. batch_expire is how often we
    	allow the fifo expire to control which request to select.
    	Default is 125ms. _async is the deadline for async requests
    	(typically writes), _sync is the deadline for sync requests
    	(reads and sync writes). Defaults are, respectively, 5 seconds
    	and 0.5 seconds.
    
    key_type:
    	The grouping key. Can be set to pgid, tgid, uid, or gid. The
    	current value is shown bracketed:
    
    	axboe@apu:[.]s/block/hda/queue/iosched $ cat key_type
    	[pgid] tgid uid gid
    
    	Default is tgid. To set, simply echo any of the 4 words into the
    	file.
    
    quantum:
    	The amount of requests we select for dispatch when the driver
    	asks for work to do and the current pending list is empty.
    	Default is 4.
    
    queued:
    	The minimum amount of requests a group is allowed to queue.
    	Default is 8.
    
    show_status:
    	Debug output showing the current state of the queues.
    
    tagged:
    	Set this to 1 if the device is using tagged command queueing.
    	This cannot be reliably detected by CFQ yet, since most drivers
    	don't use the block layer (well it could, by looking at number
    	of requests being between dispatch and completion. but not
    	completely reliably). Default is 0.
    
    The patch is a little big, but works reliably here on my laptop. There
    are a number of other changes and fixes in there (like converting to
    hlist for hashes). The code is commented a lot better, CFQ v1 has
    basically no comments (reflecting that it was writting in one go, no
    touched or tuned much since then). This is of course only done to
    increase the AAF, akpm acceptance factor. Since I'm on the road, I
    cannot provide any really good numbers of CFQ v1 compared to v2, maybe
    someone will help me out there.

    [PATCH] switchable and modular io schedulers
    
    This patch modularizes the io schedulers completely, allowing them to be
    modular.  Additionally it enables online switching of io schedulers.  See
    also http://lwn.net/Articles/102593/ .
    
    
    There's a scheduler file in the sysfs directory for the block device
    queue:
    
    axboe@router:/sys/block/hda/queue> ls
    iosched            max_sectors_kb  read_ahead_kb
    max_hw_sectors_kb  nr_requests     scheduler
    
    If you list the contents of the file, it will show available schedulers
    and the active one:
    
    axboe@router:/sys/block/hda/queue> cat scheduler
    [cfq]
    
    Lets load a few more.
    
    router:/sys/block/hda/queue # modprobe deadline-iosched
    router:/sys/block/hda/queue # modprobe as-iosched
    router:/sys/block/hda/queue # cat scheduler
    [cfq] deadline anticipatory
    
    Changing is done with
    
    router:/sys/block/hda/queue # echo deadline > scheduler
    router:/sys/block/hda/queue # cat scheduler
    cfq [deadline] anticipatory
    
    deadline is now the new active io scheduler for hda.

    [PATCH] jbd wakeup fix
    
    Processes can sleep in do_get_write_access(), waiting for buffers to be
    removed from the BJ_Shadow state.  We did this by doing a wake_up_buffer() in
    the commit path and sleeping on the buffer in do_get_write_access().
    
    With the filtered bit-level wakeup code this doesn't work properly any more -
    the wake_up_buffer() accidentally wakes up tasks which are sleeping in
    lock_buffer() as well.  Those tasks now implicitly assume that the buffer came
    unlocked.  Net effect: Bogus I/O errors when reading journal blocks, because
    the buffer isn't up to date yet.  Hence the recently spate of journal_bmap()
    failure reports.
    
    The patch creates a new jbd-private BH flag purely for this wakeup function.
    So a wake_up_bit(..., BH_Unshadow) doesn't wake up someone who is waiting for
    a wake_up_bit(BH_Lock).
    
    JBD was the only user of wake_up_buffer(), so remove it altogether.

    [PATCH] move waitqueue functions to kernel/wait.c
    
    The following patch series consolidates the various instances of waitqueue
    hashing to use a uniform structure and share the per-zone hashtable among all
    waitqueue hashers.  This is expected to increase the number of hashtable
    buckets available for waiting on bh's and inodes and eliminate statically
    allocated kernel data structures for greater node locality and reduced kernel
    image size.  Some attempt was made to look similar to Oleg Nesterov's
    suggested API in order to provide some kind of credit for independent
    invention of something very similar (the original versions of these patches
    predated my public postings on the subject of filtered waitqueues).
    
    These patches have the further benefit and intention of enabling aio to use
    filtered wakeups by standardizing the data structure passed to wake functions
    so that embedded waitqueue elements in aio structures may be succesfully
    passed to the filtered wakeup wake functions, though this patch series doesn't
    implement that particular functionality.
    
    Successfully stress-tested on x86-64, and ia64 in recent prior versions.

    [PATCH] TIOCCONS security
    
    The ioctl TIOCCONS allows any user to redirect console output to another
    tty.  This allows anyone to suppress messages to the console at will.
    
    AFAIK nowadays not many programs write to /dev/console, except for start
    scripts and the kernel (printk() above console log level).
    
    Still, I believe that administrators and operators would not like any user
    to be able to hijack messages that were written to the console.
    
    The only user of TIOCCONS that I am aware of is bootlogd/blogd, which runs
    as root.  Please comment if there are other users.
    
    Is there any reason why normal users should be able to use TIOCCONS?
    
    Otherwise I would suggest to restrict access to root (CAP_SYS_ADMIN), e.g.
    with this patch.

    [PATCH] kallsyms data size reduction / lookup speedup
    
    This patch is an improvement over my first kallsyms speedup patch posted about
    2 weeks ago.
    
    It changes scripts/kallsyms as to produce a different format for
    kallsyms_names and extra data to speedup lookups.  The compression algorithm
    is quite simple: it uses all the char codes not actually used in symbols to
    build a lookup table that translates these codes into small strings.  For
    instance, in my test runs the code 0xFE was being translated into "acpi_"
    giving a 4 byte save on every translation.
    
    The advantage of this algorithm is that to translate a symbol we only require
    information that is stored on that symbol position, and never need to go back
    on the compressed stream to get information from other symbols.
    
    To give an idea about the benefits of this algorithm here are some benchmark
    results on a P4 2.8GHz with a symbol table with 10000 entries:
    
    kallsyms_lookup average time:
      vanilla           1346.0 us
      speedup             14.4 us
      with this patch      0.5 us
    
    total data produced by scripts/kallsyms:
      uncompressed         169 Kb
      vanilla              134 Kb
      with this patch       91 Kb
    
    (speedup was my latest patch, that only changed the way kallsyms_lookup worked
    and not the data format)
    
    I removed a cond_resched() from the proc/kallsyms handling code path, because
    using stem compression, if the current position went backwards, the hole
    stream would be uncompressed up to the current position.  It seemed that by
    removing this loop it would be safe to remove the conditional reschedule
    altogether.
    
    There is just one catch with this patch: the time it takes to compile the
    kernel goes up just a bit (about 0.8s on a P4 2.8GHz with defconfig).  If this
    delay is not acceptable I can change the compression algorithm so that it can
    use the previous table (calculating a new table is what consumes most of the
    time, and not doing the actual compression) and check to see if it obtains a
    similar compression ratio.  If it does, then this is a sign that the symbol
    patterns haven't changed that much and this table is still good to use.  This
    would not only cut the time down to half on any compilation (because of the 2
    pass symbol build method), but in frequent cases where a developer is
    compiling a single file and linking everything over and over again, the table
    optimization process would never run.
    
    I'm CC'ing Brent Casavant on this email, because last june he sent a patch
    trying a different approach that used a 32 entry symbol cache, because there
    was a problem with the time "top" took to read "proc/<pid>/wchan".  I was
    hopping he would be willing to test this patch and comment on the results.

    [PATCH] Create nodemask_t
    
    The idea behind this patch is to create a nodemask_t as a node analog of
    cpumask_t.  As NUMA machines become more common, the need for a standard,
    cross-platform bitmap of both online & possible nodes becomes more
    apparent.  We believe we've worked out most of the kinks of the variable
    length bitmap types with the recent cpumask_t patches.  Nodemasks are also
    currently far less widespread than cpumasks.  Further, inclusion at this
    point in the kernel would mean consistency in node handling between 2.6 and
    2.7.
    
    Future goals would be to get rid of the 'numnodes' variable used to count
    the number of online nodes, and replace with node_online_map.  This would
    allow arbitrary node numbering and facilitate node hotplugging.
    
    (Nothing actually uses this yet, but several projects need it, and it does
    model a well-defined physical grouping).

      Nov 5 2001, Aug 8 2002. Modified by Andy Polyakov
      <appro@fy.chalmers.se> to support MMC-3 complaint DVD+RW units.
    
    and Nigel changed it to this in his 2.6 patch:
    
      Modified by Nigel Kukard <nkukard@lbsd.net> - support DVD+RW
      2.4.x patch by Andy Polyakov <appro@fy.chalmers.se>
    
    The patch I sent you deleted most of the earlier work and moved the
    rest to cdrom.c, but the comments were not moved over, since the
    earlier authors didn't modify cdrom.c.

    [PATCH] DVD+RW support
    
    This patch adds support for using DVD+RW drives as writable block devices.
    
    The patch is based on work from:
    
            Andy Polyakov <appro@fy.chalmers.se> - Wrote the 2.4 patch
            Nigel Kukard <nkukard@lbsd.net> - Initial porting to 2.6.x
    
    It works for me using an Iomega Super DVD 8x USB drive.
    
    
      Nov 5 2001, Aug 8 2002. Modified by Andy Polyakov
      <appro@fy.chalmers.se> to support MMC-3 complaint DVD+RW units.
    
      Modified by Nigel Kukard <nkukard@lbsd.net> - support DVD+RW
      2.4.x patch by Andy Polyakov <appro@fy.chalmers.se>
    
    This patch implements CDRW packet writing as a kernel block device.  Usage
    instructions are in the packet-writing.txt file.
    
    A hint: If you don't want to wait for a complete disc format, you can
    format just a part of the disc.  For example:
    
            cdrwtool -d /dev/hdc -m 10240
    
    This will format 10240 blocks, ie 20MB.

    [PCMCIA] 15-get_firstnext_region.diff
    
    pcmcia_get_{first,next}_region are tricky: they're used
    only by ds.c, but to keep backwards compatibility proper
    wrappers are needed (for the moment). However, match_region()
    doesn't work without knowing about ds.c's handle, it seems...
    but wait:
    
        while (list != NULL) {
            if (!(handle->Attributes & INFO_MTD_CLIENT) ||
                (strcmp(handle->dev_info, list->dev_info) == 0)) {
                *match = list->info;
                return CS_SUCCESS;
            }
            list = list->info.next;
        }
    
    as ds.c's handle doesn't have INFO_MTD_CLIENT, the if always
    succeeds -- allowing is to simplify it for ds.c. However, this
    means we need special functions for ds.c. It's not too large,
    fortunately.

    After noting three things, namely
    1.) CardBus cards work without ds a.k.a. pcmcia loaded,
    2.) ds a.k.a pcmcia cannot be built as module if pcmcia_core is
        built in, and
    3.) some commenting in drivers/pcmcia/Kconfig was obsolete
        [to use 32-bit cards, you don't need pcmcia-cs],
    I wrote this patch which introduces more config options for fine-
    grained tuning of what to built as what and what not to built. In
    future, 16-bit-specific code in pcmcia_core may be surrounded by
    CONFIG_PCMCIA. Also, I'll try to remove the dependency of
    yenta_socket on cardbus.

    [PATCH] fix & clean up zombie/dead task handling & preemption
    
    This patch fixes all the preempt-after-task->state-is-TASK_DEAD problems we
    had.  Right now, the moment procfs does a down() that sleeps in
    proc_pid_flush() [it could] our TASK_DEAD state is zapped and we might be
    back to TASK_RUNNING to and we trigger this assert:
    
            schedule();
            BUG();
            /* Avoid "noreturn function does return".  */
            for (;;) ;
    
    I have split out TASK_ZOMBIE and TASK_DEAD into a separate p->exit_state
    field, to allow the detaching of exit-signal/parent/wait-handling from
    descheduling a dead task.  Dead-task freeing is done via PF_DEAD.
    
    Tested the patch on x86 SMP and UP, but all architectures should work

    [PATCH] sched: fix SCHED_SMT & numa=fake=2 lockup
    
    This patch fixes an interaction between the numa=fake=<domains> feature,
    the domain setup code and cpu_siblings_map[].  The bug leads to a bootup
    crash when using numa=fake=2 on a 2-way/4-way SMP+HT box.
    
    When SCHED_SMT is turned on the domains-setup code relies on siblings not
    spanning multiple domains (which makes perfect sense).  But numa=fake=2
    creates an assymetric 1101/0010 splitup between CPUs, which results in two
    siblings being on different nodes.
    
    The patch adds a check_siblings_map() function that checks the sibling maps
    and fixes them up if they violate this rule.  (it also prints a warning in
    that case.)
    
    The patch also turns SCHED_DOMAIN_DEBUG back on - had this been enabled
    we'd have noticed this bug much earlier.

    [PATCH] sched_domains: Make SD_NODE_INIT per-arch #2
    
    Here's yet another version of a patch to implement per-arch SD_*_INITs.
    This follows the same basic idea of my last patch, but
    
    1) defines an arch-specific SD_NODE_INIT for the 4 NUMA arches (i386,
       x86_64, IA64 & PPC64),
    
    2) defines *default* SD_CPU_INIT & SD_SIBLING_INIT for *all* arches,
       with the possibility of them being overridden by simply defining an
       arch-specific version in include/asm/topology.h.
    
    The motivation behind the third version of this patch is that Martin feels
    that there should be no "default" NUMA initializer because NUMA
    characteristics are *very* arch/platform specific, and hence a "default"
    NUMA initializer can only lead to confusion.  I agree with most of that,
    but don't quite see as much harm in having a default as he does.
    Nevertheless, to keep him quiet, I've run up this version of the patch.
    Martin, please run this through your magic test suite and make sure I
    didn't break anything trivial.

    [PATCH] CPU Scheduler: fix potential error in runqueue nr_uninterruptible count
    
    Problem:
    
    In the function try_to_wake_up(), when the runqueue's nr_uninterruptible
    field is decremented it's possible (on SMP systems) that the pointer no
    longer points to the runqueue that the task being woken was on when it went
    to sleep.  This would cause the wrong runqueue's field to be decremented
    and the correct one tp remain unchanged.
    
    Fix:
    
    Save a pointer to the old runqueue at the beginning of the function and use
    it when decrementing nr_uninterruptible.

    [PATCH] sched: fixes for ia64 domain setup
    
    Still having some trouble with ia64 domain setup on the Altixes.  Jesse
    hasn't had much time to look into it, and I'm lacking an Altix, so I'm not
    sure if this is right or not...
    
    Anyway, it again does the right thing on the NUMAQ, and fixes some real
    bugs, so can you include it please?
    
    * Increase SD_NODES_PER_DOMAIN to 6 from 4 to better match Altix's
       topology. A setting of 4 will include this node, the other one
       in the brick, and the 2 nodes in the next closest brick, while 6
       will catch 2 other bricks. Probably it could be increased even
       more.
    
    * Work correctly with sparse and not completely full node maps.
    
    * Nasty typo fixed in find_next_best_node:
    	-               val = node_distance(node, i);
    	+               val = node_distance(node, n);
    
    * Ensure all nodes are themselves a member of their numa balancing
       domain. This is more a precaution against creative implementations
       of node_distance.. but it makes the setup easier to verify without
       having to look at a table of node_distance's, which is possibly
       generated at runtime.
    
    So again, I'm not too sure if this will fix the Altix setup or not.  But if
    you do a release, it will surely be less broken than it was before.

    From: Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>
    
      Builds of 2.6.9-rc1-mm5 ia64 NUMA configs fail, with many complaints that
      SD_NODE_INIT is defined twice, in asm/processor.h and linux/sched.h.
    
      I guess that the preprocessor conditionals were wrong when Nick added the
      per-arch override ability again of SD_NODE_INIT were wrong.  At least this
      change lets me rebuild ia64 again.

    [PATCH] sched: integrate cpu hotplug and sched domains
    
    Register a cpu hotplug notifier which reinitializes the scheduler domains
    hierarchy.  The notifier temporarily attaches all running cpus to a "dummy"
    domain (like we currently do during boot) to avoid balancing.  It then calls
    arch_init_sched_domains which rebuilds the "real" domains and reattaches the
    cpus to them.
    
    Also change __init attributes to __devinit where necessary.
    
    Signed-off-by: Nathan Lynch <nathanl@austin.ibm.com>
    
    Alterations from Nick Piggin:
    
    * Detach all domains in CPU_UP|DOWN_PREPARE notifiers. Reinitialise and
      reattach in CPU_ONLINE|DEAD|UP_CANCELED. This ensures the domains as
      seen from the scheduler won't become out of synch with the cpu_online_map.
    
    * This allows us to remove runtime cpu_online verifications. Do that.
    
    * Dummy domains are __devinitdata.
    
    * Remove the hackery in arch_init_sched_domains to work around the fact that
      the domains used to work with cpu_possible maps, but node_to_cpumask returned
      a cpu_online map.

    [PATCH] sched: trivial sched changes
    
    The following patches properly intergrate sched domains and cpu hotplug (using
    Nathan's code), by having sched-domains *always* only represent online CPUs,
    and having hotplug notifier to keep them up to date.
    
    Then tackle Jesse's domain setup problem: the disjoint top-level domains were
    completely broken.  The group-list builder thingy simply can't handle distinct
    sets of groups containing the same CPUs.  The code is ugly and specific enough
    that I'm re-introducing the arch overridable domains.
    
    I doubt we'll get a proliferation of implementations, because the current
    generic code can do the job for everyone but SGI.  I'd rather take a look at
    it again down the track if we need to rather than try to shoehorn this into
    the generic code.
    
    Nathan and I have tested the hotplug work. He's happy with it.
    
    I've tested the disjoint domain stuff (copied it to i386 for the test), and it
    does the right thing on the NUMAQ.  I've asked Jesse to test it as well, but
    it should be fine - maybe just help me out and run a test compile on ia64 ;)
    
    This really gets sched domains into much better shape.  Without further ado,
    the patches.

    This patch allows ReiserFS to handle I/O errors in the journal (or journal
    flush) where it would have previously panicked.  The new behavior is to
    mark the filesystem read-only, disallow new transactions to be started, and
    to allow existing transactions to complete (though not to commit).  The
    resultant filesystem can be safely umounted, and checked via normal
    mechanisms.  As it is a journaling filesystem, the filesystem itself will
    be in a similar state to the power being cut to the machine, once umounted.

    [PATCH] m32r: fix sys_tas system call for m32r
    
    This patch fixes a sys_tas system call for m32r.
    
    - This patch fixes an Oops at sys_tas() in case CONFIG_SMP && CONFIG_PREEMPT.
      > Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address XXXXXXXX
    
      It is because a page fault happens at the spin_locked region in sys_tas()
      and in_atomic() checks preempt_count, but spin_lock() already counts up
      the preemt_count.

    - sys_tas() is used for user-level mutual exclusion for the m32r,

      The above problem may be happened in a program, which uses
      pthread_mutex_lock(), calls sys_tas().
    
      The current m32r instruction set has no user-level locking
      functions for mutual exclusion.
      # I hope it will be fixed in the future...
    
    - This patch fixes the problem by using _raw_spin_lock() instead of
      spin_lock().  spin_lock() increments up preemt_count, on the contrary,
      _raw_sping_lock() does not.
    
      # I think this fix is just a temporary work around, and
      # it is preferable to be rewrite to make it simpler by using

    [PATCH] m32r: SIO driver
    
    Here is a patch to support the M32R SIO (serial IO) driver.
    
    This driver supports the M32R serial ports.
    - Supports two types M32R serial interfaces; M32R_SIO and M32R_PLDSIO.
    - With SMP safeness.
    
    Currently the M32R_PLDSIO serial interface, which is implemented on a PLD
    on the M3T-M32700UT evaluation board, has slightly different specification
    from the integrated peripheral SIO (M32R_SIO).  Now we can select them by
    CONFIG_ option.
    
    It is a serial-core based driver, based on drivers/serial/8250.c.  Any
    comments or suggestions will be appreciated.

    [PATCH] Fix show_trace() in irq context with CONFIG_4KSTACKS
    
    - valid_stack_ptr() erroneously assumes that stack always lives in
      task_struct->thread_info.
    
    - the main loop in show_trace() does not recalc ebp after stack
      switching.  With CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER every call to print_context_stack()
      will produce the same output.
    
    With this patch, show_trace() does not use task argument in the main loop.
    Instead, it converts stack to thread_info* context, and passes it to
    print_context_stack() and (implicitly) to valid_stack_ptr().
    
    valid_stack_ptr() now does bounds checking against proper context.

    [PATCH] sh: Broken-out CPU subtype probing
    
    Previously we could do subtype parsing and cache configuration in the same
    location..  but with the introduction of things like the SH7705 where we use
    SH-3 style probing with SH-4 style caches, this is no longer the case.  As
    such, we move the probe code to a saner place.

    [PATCH] ppc32: fix cpu voltage change delay
    
    This patch fixes a problem where my new powerbook would sometimes hang or
    crash when changing CPU speed.  We had schedule_timeout(HZ/1000) in there,
    intended to provide a delay of one millisecond.  However, even with
    HZ=1000, it was (I believe) only waiting for the next jiffy before
    proceeding, which could be less than a millisecond.  Changing the code to
    use msleep, and specifying a time of 1 jiffy + 1ms has fixed the problem.
    (When I looked at the msleep code, it appeared to me that msleep(1) with
    HZ=1000 would sleep for between 0 and 1ms.)
    
    Ben also asked me to remove the code that changes the AACK delay enable,
    after looking in the Darwin sources and seeing that Darwin does not change
    this in its corresponding code.

    [PATCH] generic irq subsystem: core
    
    The main goal of this patch is to consolidate all the different but still
    fundamentally similar arch/*/kernel/irq.c code into the kernel/irq/ subsystem.
    
    There are 4 new files in the kernel/irq/ directory:
    
     - handle.c: core bits: __do_IRQ() and handle_IRQ_event(),
       callable from arch-specific irq.c code.
    
     - manage.c: the main driver apis
    
     - spurious.c: the handling of buggy interrupt sources.
    
     - autoprobe.c: probing of interrupts - older code but still in use.
    
     - proc.c: /proc/irq/ code.
    
     - internals.h for irq-core-internal interfaces not visible to drivers
       nor arch PIC code.
    
    An architecture enables the generic hardirq code by defining
    CONFIG_GENERIC_HARDIRQS in its arch Kconfig.  People doing this conversion
    should check out the x86/x64/ppc/ppc64 patches for details - the conversion is
    quite straightforward but every converted function (i.e.  every function
    removed from the arch irq.c) _must_ be matched to the generic version and if
    there is any detail that the generic code should do it has to be added to the
    generic code.  All of the currently converted 4 architectures were converted
    like that, and the generic code was extended/fixed along the way.
    
    Other changes related to this patchset:
    
     - clean up the irq include files (linux/irq.h, linux/interrupt.h,
       linux/hardirq.h) and consolidate asm-*/[hard]irq.h. Note, to keep all
       non-touched architectures in an untouched state this consolidation is
       done carefully and strictly under CONFIG_GENERIC_HARDIRQS.
    
       Once the consolidation is done we can do a couple of final cleanups
       to reach the following logical splitup of 3 include files:
    
         linux/interrupt.h: driver-visible APIs and details
         linux/irq.h:       core irq and arch-PIC code, internals
         asm-*/irq.h:       arch PIC and irq delivery details
    
       the following include files will likely vanish:
    
         linux/hardirq.h    merges into linux/irq.h
         asm-*/hardirq.h:   merges into asm-*/irq.h
         asm-*/hw_irq.h:    merges into asm-*/irq.h
    
       Christoph would like to do these once the current wave of
       cleanups gets in.

    [PATCH] fork() bug invalidates file descriptors
    
    Take a process P1 that spawns a thread T (aka.  a clone with CLONE_FILES).
    If P1 forks another process P2 (aka.  not a clone) while T is blocked in a
    open() that should return file descriptor FD, then FD will be unusable in
    P2.  This leads to strange behaviors in the context of P2: close(FD)
    returns EBADF, while dup2(a_valid_fd, FD) returns EBUSY and of course FD is
    never returned again by any syscall...
    
    testcase:

    [PATCH] __set_page_dirty_nobuffers mappings
    
    Marcelo noticed that the BUG_ON in __set_page_dirty_nobuffers doesn't make
    much sense: it lost its way in 2.6.7, amidst so many page_mappings!
    
    It's supposed to be checking that, although page->mapping may suddenly go NULL
    from truncation, and although tmpfs swizzles page_mapping(page) between tmpfs
    inode address_space and swapper_space, there's sufficient stabilization while
    here in __set_page_dirty_nobuffers that the mapping after we locked
    mapping->tree_lock is the same as the mapping before we locked
    mapping->tree_lock i.e.  the lock we hold is the right one.

    [PATCH] exec: fix posix-timers leak and pending signal loss
    
    I've found some problems with exec and fixed them with this patch to
    de_thread.
    
    The second problem is that a multithreaded exec loses all pending signals.
    This is violation of POSIX rules.  But a moment's thought will show it's
    also just not desireable: if you send a process a SIGTERM while it's in the
    middle of calling exec, you expect either the original program in that
    process or the new program being exec'd to handle that signal or be killed
    by it.  As it stands now, you can try to kill a process and have that
    signal just evaporate if it's multithreaded and calls exec just then.  I
    really don't know what the rationale was behind the de_thread code that
    allocates a new signal_struct.  It doesn't make any sense now.  The other
    code there ensures that the old signal_struct is no longer shared.  Except
    for posix-timers, all the state there is stuff you want to keep.  So my
    changes just keep the old structs when they are no longer shared, and all
    the right state is retained (after clearing out posix-timers).
    
    The final bug is that the cumulative statistics of dead threads and dead
    child processes are lost in the abandoned signal_struct.  This is also
    fixed by holding on to it instead of replacing it.

    Add up resource usage counters for live and dead threads to show aggregate
    per-process usage in /proc/<pid>/stat.  This mirrors the new getrusage()

    avoid nasty race conditions, it has survived stress-testing with '(while

    [PATCH] softirqs: fix latency of softirq processing
    
    The attached patch fixes a local_bh_enable() buglet: we first enabled
    softirqs then did we do local_softirq_pending() - often this is preemptible
    code.  So this task could be preempted and there's no guarantee that
    softirq processing will occur (except the periodic timer tick).
    
    The race window is small but existent.  This could result in packet
    processing latencies or timer expiration latencies - hard to detect and
    annoying bugs.
    
    The fix is to invoke softirqs with softirqs enabled but preemption still
    disabled.  Patch is against 2.6.9-rc2-mm1.

    [PATCH] fix PTRACE_ATTACH race with real parent's wait calls
    
    There is a race between PTRACE_ATTACH and the real parent calling wait.
    For a moment, the task is put in PT_PTRACED but with its parent still
    pointing to its real_parent.  In this circumstance, if the real parent
    calls wait without the WUNTRACED flag, he can see a stopped child status,
    which wait should never return without WUNTRACED when the caller is not
    using ptrace.  Here it is not the caller that is using ptrace, but some
    third party.
    
    This patch avoids this race condition by adding the PT_ATTACHED flag to
    distinguish a real parent from a ptrace_attach parent when PT_PTRACED is
    set, and then having wait use this flag to confirm that things are in order
    and not consider the child ptraced when its ->ptrace flags are set but its
    parent links have not yet been switched.  (ptrace_check_attach also uses it
    similarly to rule out a possible race with a bogus ptrace call by the real
    parent during ptrace_attach.)
    
    While looking into this, I noticed that every arch's sys_execve has:
    
    		current->ptrace &= ~PT_DTRACE;
    
    with no locking at all.  So, if an exec happens in a race with
    PTRACE_ATTACH, you could wind up with ->ptrace not having PT_PTRACED set
    because this store clobbered it.  That will cause later BUG hits because
    the parent links indicate ptracedness but the flag is not set.  The patch
    corrects all the places I found to use task_lock around diddling ->ptrace
    when it's possible to be racing with ptrace_attach.  (The ptrace operation
    code itself doesn't have this issue because it already excludes anyone else
    being in ptrace_attach.)

    [PATCH] make rlimit settings per-process instead of per-thread
    
    POSIX specifies that the limit settings provided by getrlimit/setrlimit are
    shared by the whole process, not specific to individual threads.  This
    patch changes the behavior of those calls to comply with POSIX.
    
    I've moved the struct rlimit array from task_struct to signal_struct, as it
    has the correct sharing properties.  (This reduces kernel memory usage per
    thread in multithreaded processes by around 100/200 bytes for 32/64
    machines respectively.)  I took a fairly minimal approach to the locking
    issues with the newly shared struct rlimit array.  It turns out that all
    the code that is checking limits really just needs to look at one word at a
    time (one rlim_cur field, usually).  It's only the few places like
    getrlimit itself (and fork), that require atomicity in accessing a whole
    struct rlimit, so I just used a spin lock for them and no locking for most
    of the checks.  If it turns out that readers of struct rlimit need more
    atomicity where they are now cheap, or less overhead where they are now
    atomic (e.g. fork), then seqcount is certainly the right thing to use for
    them instead of readers using the spin lock.  Though it's in signal_struct,
    I didn't use siglock since the access to rlimits never needs to disable
    irqs and doesn't overlap with other siglock uses.  Instead of adding
    something new, I overloaded task_lock(task->group_leader) for this; it is
    used for other things that are not likely to happen simultaneously with
    limit tweaking.  To me that seems preferable to adding a word, but it would
    be trivial (and arguably cleaner) to add a separate lock for these users
    (or e.g. just use seqlock, which adds two words but is optimal for readers).
    
    Most of the changes here are just the trivial s/->rlim/->signal->rlim/.
    
    I stumbled across what must be a long-standing bug, in reparent_to_init.
    It does:
    	memcpy(current->rlim, init_task.rlim, sizeof(*(current->rlim)));
    when surely it was intended to be:
    	memcpy(current->rlim, init_task.rlim, sizeof(current->rlim));
    As rlim is an array, the * in the sizeof expression gets the size of the
    first element, so this just changes the first limit (RLIMIT_CPU).  This is
    for kernel threads, where it's clear that resetting all the rlimits is what
    you want.  With that fixed, the setting of RLIMIT_FSIZE in nfsd is
    superfluous since it will now already have been reset to RLIM_INFINITY.
    
    The other subtlety is removing:
    	tsk->rlim[RLIMIT_CPU].rlim_cur = RLIM_INFINITY;
    in exit_notify, which was to avoid a race signalling during self-reaping
    exit.  As the limit is now shared, a dying thread should not change it for
    others.  Instead, I avoid that race by checking current->state before the
    RLIMIT_CPU check.  (Adding one new conditional in that path is now required
    one way or another, since if not for this check there would also be a new
    race with self-reaping exit later on clearing current->signal that would
    have to be checked for.)
    
    The one loose end left by this patch is with process accounting.
    do_acct_process temporarily resets the RLIMIT_FSIZE limit while writing the
    accounting record.  I left this as it was, but it is now changing a limit
    that might be shared by other threads still running.  I left this in a
    dubious state because it seems to me that processing accounting may already
    be more generally a dubious state when it comes to NPTL threads.  I would
    think you would want one record per process, with aggregate data about all
    threads that ever lived in it, not a separate record for each thread.
    I don't use process accounting myself, but if anyone is interested in
    testing it out I could provide a patch to change it this way.
    
    One final note, this is not 100% to POSIX compliance in regards to rlimits.
    POSIX specifies that RLIMIT_CPU refers to a whole process in aggregate, not
    to each individual thread.  I will provide patches later on to achieve that
    change, assuming this patch goes in first.

    [PATCH] parport_pc superio chip fixes
    
    This patch fixes some troubles that somebody reported me with the superio
    chips.
    
    In short rmmod parport_pc && cat /proc/iomem was good enough for crashing
    the box hard on some machine (and hwscan --printer was doing just that).
    The way the oops triggers is that iomem tries to vsprintf the p->name, but
    the p->name was a static string in the module address (now unloaded).
    
    The reason is that the superio chip scanning leaves up to two persistent
    ranges claimed.  But the second (legacy) pass has no way to notice the
    resources are already reclaimed.  Plus if the superio->io was different
    than the "io" variable (the range to scan for superio chips) the "io" range
    would generate a leak of the original "io" range too.
    
    I simply make sure to always release the requested space during the superio
    scan, and I make sure not to istantiate new ranges in the p->base that
    would cause the later parport scan to fail too (plus leaving up to leaked
    resources).
    
    The previous code that was returning values and was leaving garbage in
    there made no sense to me.  My best guess (assuming I didn't misread it ;)
    is that probably somebody added the request_region without realizing
    they're pointing to the very same address that would be requested later
    (and nobody does accesses on those ranges until later, so it was very safe
    to claim it later).
    
    Disclaimer: I don't have the specs of the winbond and smsc at hand, I just
    guessed what they do from the code (nothing checks superio->io except
    get_superio_dma get_superio_irq, which made the thing enough self
    explainatory to fix it without specs)

    It is possible to work around the issue by adding a dummy exec domain, but it
    was rejected for not being very elegant.
    
    If this feature is implemented in userspace, it adds a 16% overhead on a test

    [PATCH] cciss: fixes for clustering
    
    This patch changes our open specifically for clustering software. We must
    allow root to access any volume or device with a LUN ID. We also modified
    our revalidate function for this reason.
    If a logical is reserved, we must register it with the OS with size=0. Then
    the backup system can call BLKRRPART after breaking the reservation to
    set the device to the correct size.
    We also must register a controller with no logical volumes for the online
    utilities to function. This is the way we've done it since the 2.2 kernel.
    Which doesn't neccesarily make it right, but we have legacy apps to consider.

    [PATCH] USB Storage: Unusual_dev patch for Finepix 1300 and 1400's.
    
    There are several cameras (1300s and 1400s) with the same bcdDevice
    number (1000). Most of them are 8070 devices, but some of them are UFI
    devices (similar to 8070 devices but don't clear the sense data after
    an INQUIRY or REQUEST SENSE). Furthermore if the devices that truely
    do act like 8070 devices are overridden to be UFI, they find more than
    one LUN. Specifiying UFI and SINGLE_LUN seems to satisfy all kinds of
    devices that claim device number 1000.

    -O2 is specified thus breaking CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER option.
    Explicitly specifying -fno-omit-frame-pointer fixes it.

    kbuild: use two double-quotes for localversion
    
    Modifies LOCALVERSION definition such that it uses
    patsubst instead of subst to remove surrounding double quotes from
    CONFIG_LOCALVERSION.  This helps syntax-highlighting editors.

    Upon request from Andi Kleen the Makefile is now created for *config

    it is expected (after kernel configuration).
    Also tell user the Makefile is generated.

    kbuild: fix 'htmldocs' and friends with O=
    
    The following patch fixes up 'htmldocs' and related to work when
    trees are being built with O=.  I fixed it all up by passing the srctree
    as an env-var to docproc (and thus what it calls) and then pull that out
    when needed.

    [PATCH] Let LLD specify INQUIRY length
    
    That sounds like a good suggestion.  Even better, instead of adding a new
    field we can simply use the existing inquiry_length.
    
    This patch changes scsi_probe_lun() to use the value in
    sdev->inquiry_length for the first INQUIRY attempt, if that value is
    nonzero.  Subsequent attempts are based, as before, on the blacklist flags
    and the Additional Length field in the INQUIRY data.
    
    The patch also contains a fairly extensive reorganization of the
    subroutine.  All the code that was duplicated for sending the INQUIRY
    command twice has been consolidated.  The routine now makes up to three
    passes:
    
    	In the first pass, the transfer length is the value initially
    	found in sdev->inquiry_length if that has been set, otherwise
    	it is the current conservative 36 bytes.
    
    	If the first pass succeeds, the routine retrieves the blist flags
    	for the device and checks the Additional Length field.  The blist
    	flags take precedence over sdev->inquiry_length, which in turn
    	takes precedence over the Additional Length.  If it turns out
    	there is more data available than we transferred the first time,
    	a second pass tries to get it.
    
    	If the second pass succeeds the INQUIRY data may have changed,
    	so the blist flags are looked up again and the Additional Length
    	is checked again.  If not, a third pass tries to get the data
    	back, using the same transfer length as the first pass.
    
    Finally, the value stored in sdev->inquiry_length is set to the amount
    actually transferred or the size computed from the Additional Length,
    whichever is smaller.
    
    Although the net change in the source file size is small, the new routine
    has more comments and less code.  Overall I think it's an improvement.

    SCSI: Fix problems with non-power-of-two sector size discs
    
    We can't support them, but the system should disable them cleanly
    and continue when they're detected (at the moment it
    dumps a stack trace).
    
    The fix (hack) is to set them to zero size and 512 byte
    sectors.  This means they're still amenable to ioctls (like
    to reformat them with a useful block size) but cannot
    be read from or written to.

    NTFS: Big cleanup of mft record writing code.
    
    - Clear the page uptodate flag in fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_write_mst_block()
      to ensure noone can see the page whilst the mst fixups are applied.
    - Add the helper fs/ntfs/mft.c::ntfs_may_write_mft_record() which
      checks if an mft record may be written out safely obtaining any
      necessary locks in the process.  This is used by
      fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_write_mst_block().
    - Modify fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_write_mst_block() to also work for
      writing mft records and improve its error handling in the process.
      Now if any of the records in the page fail to be written out, all
      other records will be written out instead of aborting completely.
    - Remove ntfs_mft_aops and update all users to use ntfs_mst_aops.
    - Modify fs/ntfs/inode.c::ntfs_read_locked_inode() to set the
      ntfs_mst_aops for all inodes which are NInoMstProtected() and
      ntfs_aops for all other inodes.
    - Rename fs/ntfs/mft.c::sync_mft_mirror{,_umount}() to
      ntfs_sync_mft_mirror{,_umount}() and change their parameters so they
      no longer require an ntfs inode to be present.  Update all callers.
    - Cleanup the error handling in fs/ntfs/mft.c::ntfs_sync_mft_mirror().
    - Clear the page uptodate flag in fs/ntfs/mft.c::ntfs_sync_mft_mirror()
      to ensure noone can see the page whilst the mst fixups are applied.
    - Remove the no longer needed fs/ntfs/mft.c::ntfs_mft_writepage() and
      fs/ntfs/mft.c::try_map_mft_record().
    - Fix callers of fs/ntfs/aops.c::mark_ntfs_record_dirty() to call it
      with the ntfs inode which contains the page rather than the ntfs
      inode the mft record of which is in the page.
    
    Ooops.  Yes, I know, I should have split this up into smaller changes...

    From: Nicolas Pitre <nico@cam.org>
    
    Free the pending TX skb inside smc_reset() rather than doing it where
    smc_reset() is called.  Worse, some places just didn't care.  Also do it when
    closing the driver.

    [PATCH] smc91x: use a work queue to reconfigure the phy from  smc_timeout()

    This way we can reconfigure the phy and sleep as needed.
    
    Also removed unnecessary locking from smc_phy_powerdown() since the chip is

    [PATCH] smc91x: move TX processing out of IRQ context entirely
    
    From: Nicolas Pitre <nico@cam.org>
    
    When large amount of packets are sent, the most likely source of throttling
    (when THROTTLE_TX_PKTS is off) is the completion of on-chip buffer allocation
    that triggers an IRQ.
    
    Instead of pushing data to the chip in IRQ context, we now schedule a tasklet
    which has the big advantage of being interruptible by the RX packet IRQ giving
    the RX processing the ultimate priority over anything else.  This is really
    important especially on the SMC91C111 which has only 4 packet buffers total
    regardless of packet size and has a tendency of suffering from RX overruns.
    This change allows RX packets to be pulled immediately upon arrival instead of
    having to wait for a (possibly much larger) TX packet to be entirely pushed
    onto the chip.
    
    The THROTTLE_TX_PKTS logic is also a bit more efficient as it now looks for a
    packet already been transmitted before stopping the queue therefore decreasing
    unnecessary TX idle periods while still keeping most buffers free for RX
    packets.

    [PATCH] smc91x: simplify register bank usage
    
    From: Nicolas Pitre <nico@cam.org>
    
    Let's avoid all that crap of preserving the bank to restore it all the time if
    that's not necessary.  The rule is simple: bank 2 is the only allowed bank
    when the chip is active and unlocked.  Anything that needs to change the bank
    to something other than bank 2 must lock against any concurrent access and
    return to bank 2 before unlocking.

    the host has only just been allocated and is set to the blank transport
    template (with zero size for host attributes).
    
    On the current model, the host attribute storage must be allocated later
    in scsi_add_host() when the driver has had an opportunity to set the transport
    template.
    
    This is getting a bit cumbersome, so it might also be better simply
    to move the transport template from the host structure into the host
    template structure instead.

     - Make the warn() on debugging assertions actually conditional :)
     - Keep a reference count on the module while its thread is running.
     - Provide empty exit function for usb_atm.ko so it's unloadable.
     - Handle firmware which is in /usr so only turns up later.

    [ALSA]  Fix drain/drop of linked PCM streams
    
    PCM Midlevel
    This patch fixes the dead-locking of linked PCM streams when
    drain/drop is called.  The counter field is added to pcm group
    struct to handle link/unlink more easily.
    
    When the PCM streams are linked, start/drain/drop are operated
    to all linked streams.  The drain will wait until draining of all
    linked streams are finished.
    
    The XRUN triggers stopping of all linked streams and changes the
    state of all of them to XRUN even if only one of them is actually
    in XRUN.

    [PATCH] USB: Fix hiddev devfs oops
    
    From: Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>
    
    There is a long-standing devfs_unregister oops in hid/hiddev.  It's caused
    by hid calling hiddev_exit before unregistering itself which in turn calls
    hiddev_disconnect.
    
    hiddev_exit removes the directory which contains the hiddev devices.
    Therefore it needs to be called after the hiddev devices have been
    disconnected.

    [PATCH] PCI Hotplug: RPA DLPAR - remove error check
    
    Here's a really long explanation for a really short patch! :)
    
    As an unfortunate side effect of runtime addition/removal of PCI Host Bridges,
    the RPA DLPAR driver can no longer depend on the success of ioremap_explicit()
    (and therefore remap_page_range()) for the case of DLPAR adding an I/O Slot.
    
    Without addressing this, an attempt to add the first child slot of a newly
    added PHB will fail when __ioremap_explicit() determines the mappings for that
    range to already exist.
    
    For a little context, __ioremap_explicit() creates mappings for the range of a
    newly added slot.  Here's why these calls will be expected to fail in some
    cases.  Keep in mind that at boot-time, the PPC64 kernel calls ioremap() for
    the entire range spanned by each PHB.  Consider the following scenarios of
    DLPAR-adding an I/O slot.
    
    1) Just after boot, one removes an I/O slot.  At this point the range
       associated with the parent PHB is fragmented, and the child range for the
       slot in question is iounmap()'ed.  One then re-adds the slot, at which point
       remap_page_range()/ioremap_explicit() restores the mappings that were
       previously removed.
    
    2) One adds a new PHB, at which point the ppc64-specific addition ioremaps the
       entire PHB range.  One then performs a DLPAR-add of a child slot of that
       PHB.  At this point, mappings already exist for the range of the slot to
       be added.  So remap_page_range()/ioremap_explicit() will fail at this point.
    
    The problem is, there's not a good way to distinguish between cases 1 and 2
    from the perspective of the DLPAR driver.  Because of that, I believe the
    correct solution to be:
    
    - Removal of relevant error prints from iounmap_explicit(), which is only used
      for DLPAR.
    - Removal of error code checks from the RPA driver

    [PATCH] PPC64: RPA dynamic addition/removal of PCI Host Bridges
    
    From: John Rose <johnrose@austin.ibm.com>
    
    The following patch implements the ppc64-specific bits for dynamic (DLPAR)
    addition of PCI Host Bridges.  The entry point for this operation is
    init_phb_dynamic(), which will be called by the RPA DLPAR driver.
    
    Among the implementation details, the global number aka PCI domain for the
    newly added PHB is assigned using the same simple counter that assigns it at
    boot.  This has two consequences.  First, the PCI domain associated with a PHB
    will not persist across DLPAR remove and subsequent add.  Second, stress tests
    that repeatedly add/remove PHBs might generate some large values for PCI
    domain.  If we decide at a later point to hash an OF property to PCI domain
    value, this can be easily fixed up.
    
    Also, the linux,pci-domain property is not generated for the newly added PHBs
    at the moment.  Because there doesn't seem to be an easy way to dynamically add
    single properties to the OFDT, and because the userspace dependency on this
    property is being questioned, I've ignored it for now.  If we decide on a
    solution for this at a later point, it can also be easily fixed up.

    Greg,
    
    
    Here is a patch (against 2.6.8-rc2) that fixes the following things:
    1) adds code to lower bus speed if the adapter card added run at a
    lower speed that the current bus speed; 2) checks for any devices on
    the same bus - not just those that sit on slots controlled by the same
    shpc; 3) cleans up the code in the check bus speed area in board_added()
    by creating two functions to handle common code.

    [PATCH] PCI: warn of missing pci_disable_device()
    
    As mentioned in Documentaion/pci.txt, pci device driver should call
    pci_disable_device() when it decides to stop using the device. But
    there are some drivers that don't use pci_disable_device() so far.
    
    This patch adds warning messages that are displayed if the device is
    removed without properly calling pci_disable_device().
    
    'WARN_ON(1)' is commented out for now because I guess many people
    (including some distros) enables 'CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL'. People might
    be surprised if many stack dumps are displayed on their console.

    [PATCH] PCI Hotplug: add host bridges to RPA hotplug subsystem
    
    The following patch implements the registration of PCI Host Bridges as hotplug
    slots.  Only host bridges that are dynamically removable will be registered.
    The hotplug slots directory goes from looking like this:
    
    # ls /sys/bus/pci/slots
    .             0000:00:02.2  0001:00:02.4  0002:00:02.2  30000000
    ..            0000:00:02.4  0001:00:02.6  0002:00:02.4  control
    0000:00:02.0  0001:00:02.2  0002:00:02.0  0002:00:02.6
    
    to this:
    
    # ls /sys/bus/pci/slots
    .             0000:00:02.0  0001:00:00.0  0001:00:02.6  0002:00:02.2  30000000
    ..            0000:00:02.2  0001:00:02.2  0002:00:00.0  0002:00:02.4  control

    This work is precursory to the DLPAR module changes that implement
    addition/removal of these bridges.  Please apply if there are no objections.

    [PATCH] add-pci_fixup_enable-pass.patch
    
    From: Bjorn Helgaas <bjorn.helgaas@hp.com>
    
    Nick Piggin's USB driver stopped working when I removed the unconditional
    PCI ACPI IRQ routing stuff.  He has verified that the attached patch fixes
    it.  I sort of hate to add another pass of PCI fixups, so I'm open to
    alternate solutions if anybody suggests one.
    
    Add a "pci_fixup_enable" pass of PCI fixups.  These are run at the end of
    pci_enable_device() to fix up things like IRQs that are not set up until
    then.  Some VIA boards require a fixup after the IRQ is set up.  Found by
    Nick Piggin, initial patch by Bjorn Helgaas, reworked to fit into current
    -mm by Nick.

    Yes, I agree. The problem is there isn't a straightforward method for
    it. It possibly is hard to get it.

    Original PCI assign resources code is the last 'subsys_initcall'
    according to the makefile, so move some code of it to 'fs_initcall'
    (just below 'subsystem_initcall') should be ok. As you said, ACPI and
    PnP is linked before chr/mem.c. The method requires all other
    'fs_initcall' don't touch PCI resources, since
    'pcibios_assign_resources' is a 'fs_initcall' and maybe don't run, but
    it looks ok currently. Again, I will be appreciated if we can find a
    solution to make the ordering explicit.

    [PATCH] PCI: update Documentation/power/pci.txt
    
    That document was wrong on some things, misleading on others; this
    fixes some of the issues I noticed.
    
    However it probably needs to say that drivers for devices that implement
    the PCI PM spec "should" always use pci_set_power_state() to reduce the
    power usage.  If I get ambitions I might submit a patch to the PCI core
    to print a nag message for drivers that don't do that.
    
    
    Updates the PCI PM docs, better matching the specs and code.
    
      - List both D3 states (D3hot, D3cold) up front.
    
      - Clarify that suspend() methods should disable I/0 (including DMA)
        and IRQs; it's not optional.
    
      - More accurately describe resume(); there are common cases where
        device re-initialization isn't appropriate.  The previous text said
        re-init was always required; that's false.

This patch adds in the driver support to use the vlan tag add/remove hardware, and enables the drivers use of the kernel vlan hwaccel interface.

    I have a suspicion. Actually, it was pointed to me by a kind soul before,
    but I forgot who he was, unfortunately. I'm not sure if this is the
    problem, but please try it if you can. It should apply on top of "latest".
    I really hate that word, but in this case I haven't got a version number.

    While polling in NAPI mode, we were occassionally getting interrupts
    re-enabled by the watchdog trying to generate a software interrupt.  Fix
    is to add a spinlock around that shared hardware register to allow a
    read-modify-write operation.  This was nasty nasty.  I don't like the
    spinlock in the hot path but i see no other way.  Comments are welcome.
    Updates the driver version as well.

    [PATCH] add ability to set device queue depth to mptfusion
    
    This patch lets you override the default queue depth for SCSI devices
    attached through the mptfusion driver.
    
    I moved some common code that I needed out of mpt_slave_configure()
    into its own function.
    
    New patch with some style issues fixed.  I went ahead and moved the
    logical "and" to the end of the line from the start of the next line.
    I agreed with Matthew's reasoning on the comparison with 0.

    [PATCH] USB: use add_hotplug_env_var() in core/usb.c
    
    Use the new add_hotplug_env_var() function in drivers/usb/core/usb.c.
    In addition to cleaning up the code, this fixes a (probably harmless)
    bug here: for each value added to the environment, the code did
    
    	length += sprintf(...);
    
    and then
    
    	scratch += length;
    
    which means that we skip the sum of the lengths of all the values
    we've put so far, rather than just the length of the value we just
    put.  This is probably harmless since we're unlikely to run out of
    space but if nothing else it's setting a bad example....
    
    I've tested this on a system with USB floppy and CD-ROM; hotplug gets
    the same environment with the patch as without.

    [PATCH] USB: handle usb host allocation failures gracefully
    
    It looks like a host (like ohci or whatever) could try to allocate a new
    usb_device structure with usb_alloc_dev and get back a valid pointer even if
    the allocation of its private data failed.  I first saw this in the 2.4
    sources, but it looks like 2.6 has the same problem.  This patch attempts to
    fix it by freeing dev if the ->allocate() routine fails, and then returns
    NULL instead of a potentially dangerous dev pointer.

    [PATCH] usb/mdc800: cleanup set_current_state() around wait queues
    
    This patch cleans up the wait queue usage in this driver.  The state is
    no longer set until just before the task sleeps, which removes a few
    set_current_state()s. Correspondingly, the state doesn't need to be set
    back to TASK_RUNNING outside of the while-loops, as schedule_timeout()
    takes care of it.

    [PATCH] initio: remove obsolete APIs, cleanup
    
    This patch has the usual cleanups for the initio driver:
    
     - remove scsi.h APIs
     - add missing statics
     - remove the trivial internal queuing for the srb allocation failure case
    
    but while doing that I noticed that the two source files use completely
    different headers, and the interface between the two files often casted
    to generic types just to cast it back to a separate defintion of the
    same type again.  In one case the structures were even mismatching, but
    because we allocated the bigger defintion and only passed pointers
    around it actually worked..
    
    Thanks to Rodrigo Severo for testing this patch.

    [PATCH] USB: export inteface and configuration strings to sysfs
    
     this patch adds exporting of configuration and interface strings to sysfs.
    
     both configuration and interface strings are present on my Nokia
     7610 phone, which can be connected via USB, and I thought it would be a
     good idea to make them easily accessible via sysfs:
    
     [root@cs181035096 usb1]# cat 1-1/manufacturer 1-1/product
     Nokia
     7610
     [root@cs181035096 usb1]# grep "" `find . -name configuration`
     ./1-1/configuration:First and Last and Always
     [root@cs181035096 usb1]# grep "" `find . -name interface`
     ./1-1/1-1:1.6/interface:CDC Data Interface
     ./1-1/1-1:1.5/interface:CDC Comms Interface
     ./1-1/1-1:1.3/interface:PC Suite Services
     ./1-1/1-1:1.1/interface:SYNCML-SYNC
    
     The first two interfaces are for accessing the GPRS modem, they are
     recognized and supported perfectly by the cdc_acm driver. The last two
     are CDC OBEX interfaces, for which there is no driver currently, but I plan to
     write one. This would allow userspace to do really nifty things, for
     example accessing the phone filesystem, and exchanging contacts and
     calendar entries via SyncML. Pretty much the same thing that Nokia PC
     Suite does. But the software needs to distinguish between the two OBEX
     interfaces (which is syncml and which is file transfer? the only way to
     know is to read the strings), and that"s why this patch was written.

    [PATCH] usb: extract sensible strings from buggy string descriptors
    
    The Freebox is a USB modem popular in France.  It returns bogus string
    descriptors: while the string part is there, the length and type bytes
    are both zero.  This patch detects that case and tries to recover a
    sensible string by scanning for printable Latin characters.  This not
    only causes the modem to spring to life (because usbnet gets a valid
    MAC address) - it also means you get the correct Product and Manufacturer
    strings in sysfs and elsewhere.  This patch is in the "mostly harmless"
    category.

    qla1280: ISP1020/1040 support
    
    From: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>
    
    This patch adds support for the older ISP1020/1040 chips to the qla1280
    driver.  In fact it does not add much support but enables the work
    merged earlier.
    
    It's been tested to work nicely on x86 and alpha machines by multiple
    people, it unfortunately doesn't work on SGI mips systems yet, but I'm
    pretty sure that's due to bugginess in the pci code for those
    plattforms.

    The USB bug reported in:
    
    http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3466
    
    Looks to be because we allow device and host removal
    while some commands are in-flight.
    
    This can be fixed by taking and releasing a ref
    on the scsi_device when the commands are allocated

    [PATCH] I2C: Store lm83 and lm90 temperatures in signed
    
    Back when I wrote the lm83 and lm90 drivers, I decided to use unsigned
    variables to store temperature values as mirrored from the chipset
    registers. I wonder why, since the registers use signed values
    themselves. The patch below changes the variables back to signed types,
    so as to simplify the conversions made by the driver, making them faster
    and easier to understand.
    
    Additionally, the lm90 driver was lacking boundary checkings and proper
    rounding when writing temperature limits to the chipset, so I added
    these. I also reworded the comments about internal temperature values
    representation for all chipsets.
    
    Tested to work fine on my (LM90-compatible) ADM1032 chip. lm83 patch
    untested, but it is more simple and directly copied from the lm90, so I
    am confident it works fine too.

       here's a more controversial one. Firstly, auerchain_unlink_urb:1180

       error code returned by usb_unlink_urb. usb_kill_urb is a void,
       however, so I've removed the error checking. For the sake of
       debugging, the dbg-line announcing the name of the function is
       probably enough.

    [PATCH] USB storage: delayed device scanning
    
    This patch started life as as366, got some modifications, and lives now as

    Many devices work better with this delay.  We believe we can remove several
    US_FL_FIX_INQUIRY unusual_devs.h entries with this patch.  (That's a hint,
    Phil!)
    
    The delay is adjustable via a sysfs parameter which is global to the
    usb-storage module.  The default is 5 seconds.

    [PATCH] USB: OHCI support for PXA27x
    
    here's a patch from Nico to add PXA27x OHCI support.
    Please merge; it applies on top of your current BK with
    some offsets, but I can't build that tree for ARM because
    of some #include lossage.
    
    OHCI driver for the Intel PXA27x processor

    [PATCH] USB Gadget: Ethernet/RNDIS gadget, minor updates
    
    Helps battery recharge, and gives this a new version string
    since it's changed a lot since St. Patrick's Day.
    
    
    Just minor updates:
    
     - use usb_gadget_vbus_draw() when changing configs, so that USB can
       be used to recharge batteries (or whatever); and report power use.
       bMaxPower is now 100 mA except with OTG (where it's 8mA).
    
     - rename /proc/rndis/000 as /proc/driver/rndis-000, and only have it
       when a new CONFIG variable is set (added by a later patch)
    
     - minor fixes to make some debug-only rndis messages compile
    
     - version is now "Equinox 2004".

    merge a100u2w source files
    
    From: 	Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>
    
    looking at the a100u2w driver the split between the inia100.c and
    i60uscsi.c source files is hindering work badly.  So I'm attaching
    below a new a100u2w.c that is a merge of those two, but no code changes
    at all (yet) - just the comment headers and includes of the two merged,
    then rest of i60uscsi.c, then rest of inia100.c.

    [PATCH] aacraid: dynamic dev update
    
    Here is the patch with Christoph's comments addressed.
    
    Description from Mark Salyzyn:
    
    The main purpose of this patch is to move the array's cached request
    sense packets into a per-adapter structure rather than leaving it global
    (before ID 1,0,0,0 shares 2,0,0,0 cached sense). SAS pressed this change
    as we needed to allocate the sense packets dynamically.

    Well quirk_usb_early_handoff() should be __devinit, not __init.
    
    There are a few other things in there which look hotpluggy, and are marked
    __init.  The whole thing needs a review.

    [PATCH] Put symbolic links between drivers and modules in the sysfs tree
    
    This functionality is essential for us to work out which drivers are
    supplied by which modules.  We use this in turn to work out which
    modules are necessary to find the root device (and hence what
    initrd/initramfs needs to insert).
    
    If you look at debian at the moment, it uses a huge mapping table on
    /proc/scsi/* to do this.  If we implement the sysfs feature, we can
    simply go from /sys/block/<device> to the actual device to the driver
    and then to the module with no need of any fixed tables.

    [PATCH] USB: Use list_for_each_entry etc. in UHCI driver
    
    This patch was developed largely by Domen Puncer.  It makes the code in
    the UHCI driver more readable by utilizing list_for_each_entry and related
    macros.  I merely made a couple of very small stylistic changes and
    converted one additional hunk of code.

    This patch makes the newly-probed hub pathway, the hub reset pathway, and
    the resumed hub pathway all use the same routine for activating the hub
    and scanning for port change events as soon as possible.  It's a modified
    version of something originally written by David Brownell, updated to
    match the current source.  Please apply.

    [PATCH] USB: host side fixes for pxa2xx/ethernet/rndis gadgets, like gumstix
    
    This fixes an interop glitch with PXA gadgets; please merge.
    
    
    This resolves an issue that's more or less specific to hosts trying to
    talk pxa255 based Linux devices using the Ethernet/RNDIS gadget driver.
    
      - Teaches "usbnet" about the product ID used by pxa255 based devices
        when they enable RNDIS, since it won't be using CDC Ethernet.
    
      - Forces usbcore config selection code to use non-RNDIS configurations,
        even when their class is vendor-specific (as in the pxa255 case).
    
    This makes gumstix devices, for example, talk with Linux 2.6.9 hosts
    AND with Windows ... previously only one would work.

    Net2280 patches to:
    
      - Make reset logic ensure endpoint toggle and halt bits only get cleared

        state when a setup packet come in after we've checked the reset status
        but before calling ep_reset().
    
      - Avoid a disconnect hang by exchanging SUSPEND_IMMEDIATELY (intended for
        use when the 8051 is the PCI host) with SUSPEND_REQUEST_INTERRUPT to
        suspend the NET2280.
    
      - Make rmmod of gadget drivers trigger disconnect; earlier changes to
        reset logic broke this.

    [PATCH] USB: Fix oops in usblp driver
    
    This bug was reported back in July, and I sent out a patch but apparently
    it never got to you.  The usblp driver was calling usb_buffer_free() from
    usblp_cleanup(), which runs after disconnect() if a user process holds the
    device open.  But once the usb_device is gone usb_buffer_free() will
    oops.  The patch frees the buffers in usb_disconnect() instead.
    
    Recently Joost Witteveen reported the same oops and found that the
    patch solved it for him.  So there shouldn't be problems with accepting
    it.

    [PATCH] Allow LLDD's to fail slave alloc (non-existent slave)
    
    In the cases where an LLDD knows that a lun does not exist, if it
    fails slave_alloc(), the midlayer reports an error message indicating
    slave_alloc failed.
    
    This patch allows the LLDD to reject the slave_alloc() call if it
    knows the lun doesn't exist, and skips the reporting of the
    slave_alloc failure message. This avoids jumping through hoops in the
    LLDD to avoid error messages from slave_alloc. Also saves cycles in
    that the probe is also cancelled for the non-existent device.

    [PATCH] (3/4) acenic - __iomem warnings cleanup
    
    This cleans all the compile warnings and most of the sparse warnings
    for the acenic driver relating to io memory space.
    Remaining warnings are because tx_ring can be either in i/o or not
    depending on the version of the card.
    Not tested on old TIGON card.

    scsi: Add reset ioctl capability to ULDs
    
    Currently, the only way to issue a SCSI reset of any
    type is to use the sg device.  By adding extra ioctls
    to scsi_ioctl.c we enable this for all ULDs.
    
    The slight complication is that scsi_ioctl() is usually
    only called when the device has been checked not to be
    undergoing eh recovery.  Resets may be issued in
    this scenario if the user opens the device O_NONBLOCK.

    There are several more which deltas in qla_dbg.c which are suspect

    Yeah, I think one of these is the culprit.  Before I got your message, I fixed
    some of them in my tree already (see attached) and things seem to work.

    kevent: add block mount and umount support
    
    Send notification over the new netlink socket to let userspace know that
    the filesystem code claims/releases the superblock on an blockdevice.
    This way, userspace can get rid of constantly polling /proc/mounts to
    watch for filesystem changes.

    This patch adds support for calling usb_reset_device() on hubs (other than

    [PATCH] USB: Patch for 3 ub bugs in 2.6.9-rc1-mm4
    
    Actual users of ub quickly found problems, so here's a patch to address
    some of them.
    
    #1: An attempt to mount a CF card, pull the plug, then unmount causes a
    message "getblk: bad sector size 512" and an oops. This is caused by
    trying to do put_disk from disconnect instead of using a reference count.
    The sd.c does it this way (it uses kref).
    
    #2: The hald fills /var/log/messages with block device errors. It seems
    that it happens because ub allowed opens of known offline devices, and
    then partition checking produced those errors. I hope taking code from
    sd.c should fix it.
    
    Also I replaced usb_unlink_urb with usb_kill_urb.

    [PATCH] I2C: Update Documentation/i2c/writing-clients
    
    This is a very small an update to Documentation/i2c/writing-clients. The
    changes are about i2c client driver ID. It used to say that chip driver
    writers should ask for a unique ID. It now explains that such an ID is
    not required and they can go without it. Until we get plain rid of it...
    
    The patch additionally features CodingStyle updates. We can't ask people
    to respect it and at the same time ignore it in our own docs.
    
    I have made a similar change to the i2c (the project) documentation, and
    will propose an update to Marcelo for Linux 2.4 (not sure he will accept
    it though).

    is specially tailored to meet the needs of drivers that have to reset a
    device either during probe() or during normal operations.  It updates a
    few drivers that do device resets, to make them use the new routine.  It
    also adds a new field to struct usb_interface, to keep track of whether
    the interface is in the process of being bound to or unbound from a
    driver.  This is necessary, because during binding we know the device is
    already locked so we don't want to try to acquire the lock again!
    
    With this patch in place, USB device resets should finally become
    reliable.

    [PATCH] USB: Updated USB device locking
    
    This patch reintroduces the USB device locking code we tried out
    earlier.  As before, it solves the problem of effectively locking all
    the devices while drivers are registered and unregistered by introducing
    an rwsem.  Unlike the earlier attempt, this version does not ever try to
    acquire a lock re-entrantly.  I trust that will eliminate the races and
    hang-ups you observed with the earlier version.  There are also copious
    comments explaining exactly how things should work.
    
    The patch interacts slightly with the locktree() code introduced by
    David for suspend/resume support.  It doesn't change the functionality
    at all; it just updates the routine to follow the new locking rules.

    [PATCH] USB: ohci init refactor
    
    Please merge, some recent changes made problems
    by making init take too long.  This also adds a bit of
    support for detecting the funky resume states that
    happen with suspend-to-disk (like swsusp, pmdisk).
    
    
    Refactor controller initialization ... this is most of the patch by volume.
    
     - A time-critical section now runs with IRQs blocked, rather than being split
       over two separate routines.  (I've recently seen init failures because of
       preemption in the middle of that 2msec timeout, presumably by khubd.)
    
     - Bus glue for PCI, LH7A404, OMAP, and SA-1100 now shares more init logic;
       that'll help shrink support for upcoming non-PCI patches too.
    
     - Move the root hub register macros to the header (for debug build issue)
    
     - More tweaks to the frame clock initialization, including slightly more
       helpful diagnostics on "init err".
    
    Better SWSUSP support.
    
     - Detects and handles some funky "resume after suspend-to-disk" cases.  These
       need to go through full driver re-init.
    
     - Restore root hub to CONFIGURED state on resume.

    [PATCH] start removing queue from tmscsim
    
    So actually I have a patch that starts to remove internal queueing from
    tmscsim.  This gets rid of internal queueing for those cases where we
    can just make the midlayer do the the work by returning erros from
    ->queuecommand (and cleans up the tmscsim queuecommand implementation
    singnificantly).
    
    Next step would get rid of the more complicated internal queueing where
    we need to make the scsi layer requeue by returning appropinquate DID_
    values from ->scsidone.

    scsi: normalize fixed and descriptor sense data
    
    From: Douglas Gilbert <dougg@torque.net>
    
    The patch only touches two files: scsi.h and scsi_lib.c
    It adds the proposed facility and then uses it in scsi_lib
    in roughly 4 locations. IMO there were 3 sense processing errors:
       - block SG_IO did not get passed back deferred errors
         [SG_IO is a __pass-through__ interface!!]
       - MEDIUM_ERRORs _do_ get processed for deferred sense errors
         in scsi_io_completion() which seems unintended
         [I did not fix this one.]
       - invalid command operation code handling in
         __scsi_mode_sense() was just wrong
    
    If people think this is a reasonable approach, then the rest of
    the scsi mid-level and upper level driver could be converted.
    As Kai pointed we may need some general routines to pick up the
    sense data "extras".
    
    The benefit of doing this conversion is that it may well
    highlight a lot more sense data processing errors (if the
    above is any guide).
    
    Changes:
        - add structure to receive normalized sense data from either
          fixed or descriptor format sense data
        - add scsi_normalize_sense() function to populate that structure
        - add scsi_sense_is_deferred() function so deferred errors can
          be ignored in many contexts
        - apply new mechanism to sense data processing within the
          scsi_lib.c file

    Kobject Userspace Event Notification
    
    Implemetation of userspace events through a netlink socket. The kernel events
    layer provides the functionality to raise an event from a given kobject
    represented by its sysfs-path and a signal string to describe the type of
    event.
    
    Currently, kobject additions and removals are signalized to userspace by forking
    the /sbin/hotplug helper. This patch moves this special case of userspace-event
    out of the kobject core to the new kobject_uevent implementation. This makes it
    possible to send all hotplug messages also through the new netlink transport.
    
    Possible new users of the kernel userspace functionality are filesystem
    mount events (block device claim/release) or simple device state transitions
    (cpu overheating).
    
    To send an event, the user needs to pass the kobject, a optional
    sysfs-attribute and the signal string to the following function:
    
      kobject_uevent(const char *signal,
                     struct kobject *kobj,
                     struct attribute *attr)
    
      Example:
      kobject_uevent("overheating", &cpu->kobj, NULL);
    
    The message itself is sent over multicast netlink socket, which makes
    it possible for userspace to listen with multiple applications for the same
    messages.

       - correct and expand standard INQUIRY response, include version
         descriptors

    [PATCH] Add BLIST_INQUIRY_36 to all USB blacklist entries
    
    This patch adds the BLIST_INQUIRY_36 flag to all the SCSI blacklist
    entries for USB devices.  While it may not be strictly necessary for all
    of them, it doesn't hurt: Since the usb-storage driver doesn't use any of
    the INQUIRY data after the first 36 bytes, there's no reason to try
    reading any more of it.  And some devices crash when we try to read more,
    even though they advertise that more bytes are available.  The usb-storage
    driver does try to set the flag automatically, but the blacklist entries
    override that setting.

    [PATCH] USB: early usb handoff for 2.6
    
            Apparently there is an issue w/ the IBM x440/x445's BIOS's USB
    Legacy support. Due to the delay in issuing SMI's across the IOAPICs,
    its possible for I/O to ports 60/64 to cause register corruption.
    
    The solution is to disable the BIOS's USB Legacy support early in
    boot(via PCI quirks) for x440/x445 systems.
    
    Originally written by Vojtech against SuSE's tree, this patch was then
    updated to disable EHCI by Aleksey Gorelov, cleaned up by Pete Zaitcev
    for 2.4 and finally tweaked and updated against 2.6 by me.
    
    I've lightly tested this version of the patch, but it differs little
    from what Aleksey, Pete and I have been testing for 2.4.

    Make the SPI transport parameters operate at the target level
    
    Technically, the transfer agreement governs the I_T nexus (the
    target) not the I_T_L nexus (the device), so make it operate
    of the scsi_target structure.

    Add host and target transport class abstractions
    
    This patch makes a transport class be composed of up to three individual
    device classes representing potential interfaces on the scsi_device,
    scsi_target and Scsi_Host.  A class only has to implement at least one
    of these, but may optionally implement more.

Date:   Thu Sep 9 06:14:59 2004 -0500

    Add scsi_target abstraction and place it in sysfs
    
    For some of the transport class attributes, we need to hang them off the
    SCSI target rather than the LUN (represented by scsi_device).  To do this
    efficiently, we need to make the target visible in the sysfs hierarchy.
    
    The net effect of this change is to make an extra target component appear
    in all the SCSI sysfs paths:

    [PATCH] USB: omap_udc supports 5910/1510 chips
    
    This removes the "don't run on OMAP 1510" constraint from the
    driver and teaches it how not to use registers only available on
    newer chips.  It's effectively just a compile fix, though ... hasn't
    got any board support yet.
    
    
    Basic build fixes for the OMAP 1510/5910.  This first generation chip
    doesn't include an OTG controller.  The patch makes the driver stop
    using OTG registers, and adds some #defines that will be needed to
    support boards using those chips.

    [PATCH] USB: khubd looks at ports after probe
    
    Fix the hub probe logic so that when khubd wakes up, it will actually
    look at all ports on the new hub.  This resolved a root hub enumeration
    issue, and I expect the "boot from USB disk" folk will like this too.
    
    The fix includes cleanup: centralizing the logic to make khubd look
    at a given hub, instead of cloning it three times (or in the case of
    hub probing, frankensteining it).
    
    This also adds a FIXME to the new routine centralizing disconnect
    processing:  we also want "power down port but don't wake khubd"
    (for PM_SUSPEND_DISK as well as SRP).

    [PATCH] USB: ohci updates
    
    Small bugfixes, at least one of which gets rid of  some
    rather random behavior from certain board init
    behaviors.
    
    
    OHCI updates:
    
     - Bugfix the code taking frame clock adjustments from the boot loader.
       A recent change had a bug which caused inconsistent failures on some
       OHCI configs, including amd756.  Thanks to <pacman@manson.clss.net>
       for tracking down the specifics.
    
     - From Lothar Wassmann <lk@karo-electronics.de> two fixes:
         (a) don't let tick clock sign-extend, that can make unlinks
             take excessively long (could happen easily enough);
         (b) when re-activating schedules after suspend, use the right
             bitmask (rare/exotic)
    
     - When suspending the root hub, mark it as USB_STATE_SUSPENDED

    [PATCH] export usb_set_device_state(), use in ohci
    
    This patch is mostly cleanup, but it all helps make PM_SUSPEND_DISK
    start to behave better.
    
    
    This exports the new usb_set_device_state() routine for the virtual root
    hubs, and uses it in OHCI during resume after power-off to replace some
    HC-private code doing almost the same thing.
    
    Note that all HCDs will likely need the same kind of suspend-to-disk
    support (though it's different when BIOS kicks in).  Some systems
    even power-off during suspend-to-ram (to save extra power), which is
    why OHCI already has this logic!
    
    Related updates:
    
     - Use usb_set_device_state() immediately when an HC dies, making khubd
       handle disconnect processing instead of a workqueue.  So now drivers
       won't self-deadlock in this should-be-rare path, when disconnect()
       calls flush_scheduled_work().
    
     - Don't warn about "Unlink after no-IRQ" for the the root hub's status
       URB ... like when suspending an HCD that never enumerated a device.
    
     - Minor IRQ handler cleanup, including more accurate tracking of whether
       this driver ever returned IRQ_HANDLED (shared IRQs don't count).

    Added slave->ttl - time to live for the registered slave.
    When slave was not found we will not remove it immediately but wait until ->ttl attempts were done.
    It prevents various debouncing effects(problems with pull-up, power).

    [PATCH] I2C: Fix macro calls in chip drivers
    
    I noticed that some I2C chip drivers (all written or reviewed by me, I
    feel ashamed to say) misuse macros. Passing function calls
    (simple_strtol in this case) to macros evaluating their argument up to 4
    times is certainly not wise and obviously performs poorly. It is not
    critical in that it happens only when writing to the chips (setting
    limits), which doesn't happen that often. However I'd say it's worth
    fixing.
    
    Thus, the patch below fixes that, by moving the function calls outside
    of the macro calls.

    [PATCH] USB Storage: change how INQUIRY is fixed up
    
    The usb-storage driver 'fixes up' the INQUIRY data returned by a device so
    that it reads SCSI rev 2 by intercepting the data in-flight.  This was done
    to make various SCSI drivers (sd, sr, etc.) work with the device.
    
    However, this technique also has the unfortunate side-effect that nobody
    can see the real rev. -- not even sg users.
    
    This patch changes that.  Now, the SCSI revision is changed in the
    slave_configure() function.  Thus, the 'real' data is available to anyone
    who wants to issue an INQUIRY directly via any means.
    
    This also simplifies the code somewhat.

    This addresses an SMP-only issue with the EHCI driver, where only one CPU

    to Olaf Hering for isolating the failure mode, and testing this fix!
    
    Once once CPU starts scanning, any other might as well finish right

    [ALSA]  remove gameport/MIDI support
    
    Documentation,PCI drivers,Intel8x0 driver
    snd-intel8x0's gameport/MIDI code has quite a few problems:  the port
    addresses cannot be detected reliably (or not at all with newer LPC
    bridge devices), joystick port address 0x208 isn't supported, the MIDI
    interrupt isn't detected, PnP isn't supported, changing the port
    addresses in the LPC bridge configuration doesn't affect the devices
    in the Super-I/O chip connected to the LPC bus, and registering this
    driver for the LPC bridge PCI device prevents other drivers using the
    LPC's PCI id from loading later.
    
    All these problems can be cured by removing the offending code and
    using the proper modules for these devices (ns558/snd-mpu401) instead.

    [PATCH] prism54 initial WPA support
    
    * Work based on initial patches from Jouni Malinen <jkmaline@cc.hut.fi>
    * Initial wpa_supplicant support work:
    * isl_ioctl.c (prism54_process_trap_helper): Start to use mlmeex,
    * start doing what's right for
    * DOT11_OID_AUTHENTICATEEX,
    * DOT11_OID_ASSOCIATEEX,
    * DOT11_OID_ASSOCIATEEX, and
    * DOT11_OID_REASSOCIATEEX
    
    * isl_ioctl.c: add temporary structure for wpa_supplicant requests,
    
    * isl_ioctl.c: add prism2_ioctl_set_encryption which can probably be removed
    later
    
    * isl_ioctl.c: add prism2_ioctl_set_generic_element (well tested)
    
    * isl_ioctl.c: add prism2_ioctl_mlme which should be unnecessary since
    * WE scan should be used by wpa_supplicant
    
    * isl_ioctl.c: add prism54_hostapd - this parses wpa_supplicant
    * requests and does the right job for each
    
    * isl_ioctl.c (prism54_set_wpa): changed to not use mgt_set/mgt_commit
    * as commit is unecessary. Added proper OID sets to enable/disable WPA.
    * This is called by wpa_supplicant at startup. This should eventually
    * be part of WE18.
    
    * isl_ioctl.c (prism54_ioctl): Links wpa_supplicant to prism54
    
    * isl_ioctl.h: defined prism54_set_wpa to allow prism54_hostapd to use
    
    * isl_oid.h: add struct obj_attachment for OID OID_TYPE_ATTACH
    
    * oid_mgt.c: map OID DOT11_OID_ATTACHMENT to struct obj_attachment
    
    * oid_mgt.c (mgt_le_to_cpu, mgt_cpu_to_le): handle endianness for
    * obj_attachment
    
    * oid_mgt.c: add mgt_set_varlen, needed for mlmeex as it has a
    * variable size field.
    
    * oid_mgt.c: add mgt_unlatch_all, this can be used to force a commit
    * on OIDs:
    * MEDIUMLIMIT, BEACONPERIOD, DTIMPERIOD, ATIMWINDOW,
    * LISTENINTERVAL, FREQUENCY, EXTENDEDRATES
    * These OIDs are "latched". TODO: config mode handling.
    * oid_mgt.c (mgt_response_to_str): learn to parse OID_TYPE_ATTACH
    * oid_mgt.h: add mgt_set_varlen, and mgt_unlatch_all

    [PATCH] USB: Centralize logical disconnects in the hub driver
    
    This patch takes some code that was only used in one place in the hub
    driver, and packages it up into a subroutine which is now called from
    several places.  The routine does a logical disconnect -- for example,
    after issuing a port reset, if the device descriptors have changed
    (because of a firmware update perhaps) we logically disconnect the old
    device structure and create a new one.  Or if a resume fails for any
    reason we can do the same thing.
    
    This touches some of David Brownell's suspend/resume code, obviously.
    (It also fixes a couple of small errors in there.)  He has said it looks
    okay.

    [PATCH] USB: close waits for drain in pl2303
    
    Here is an additional patch for pl2303 in 2.6.9-rc1,
    to be applied after my previous circular buffer patch.
    This patch waits for the buffer to drain on close and
    then clears the buffer.  In addition to the obvious
    features, this also fixes a bug where closing a port
    with a full buffer would accidentally disable writes
    when the port was re-opened.
    
    The original pl2303 could lose data that was still going
    out the port on close, and even this patch only solves
    the problem completely for data rates of 1200 bps and
    above.
    
    Waiting for data to drain from the circular buffer is
    easy, but the problem is waiting for data to drain from
    the 256 byte hardware buffer on the device.  I don't know
    how much data is in the hardware buffer, so I just wait
    long enough for a potentially full hardware buffer to
    drain, but I don't want to wait that long for low data
    rates if the buffer isn't full.  There is probably some
    way to query the pl2303 to find out how much data is in
    its hardware buffer, maybe snooping would reveal that.
    
    - Added a wait for data to drain from the driver
      write buffer when closing.
    
    - Added a wait for the data to drain from the
      device hardware buffer when closing.
    
    - Cleared the driver write buffer when closing.

    [PATCH] USB: circular buffer for pl2303
    
    Here is the patch adding a circular buffer to pl2303
    updated to 2.6.9-rc1.  Phil and I both tested this.
    (Phil tested a slightly different earlier version.)
    
    This fixes the carriage return newline problem Olaf
    Hering reported and helps Phil with hotsyncing his
    phone.  This patch also fixes a problem that would
    sometimes leave a pl2303 port unable to send data,
    reporting "already writing", after closing the port
    while writing was in progress.  This happened about
    1/3 of the time in my tests with the stock 2.6.9-rc1
    pl2303 driver.
    
    
    - Added a circular write buffer, protected by the
      existing spin lock.
    
    - Write_room and chars_in_buffer now report room and
      chars in the circular buffer.
    
    - Added a "bounce buffer" when transfering data from
      user space to the circular buffer--needed for locking.
    
    - Replaced (urb->status != -EINPROGRESS) with a private
      write_urb_in_use flag protected by the existing spin
      lock.  Clear this flag when the urb is unlinked.
    
    - Free memory on failed startup.
    
    - These changes make ONLCR mapping work and fix a bug
      that would sometimes leave the port unable to write,
      reporting "already writing", after closing the port
      while writing was in progress.

    [PATCH] HCD PCI probe: print actual, not ioremapped, address
    
    I think the USB HCD should print the actual PCI memory address, not the
    ioremapped address.  AFAIK, there's no reason the ioremapped address has
    to have any fixed relationship to the actual address.  Also, this makes
    it match what's in /proc/iomem.  I also added a leading "0x".  Example
    from ia64:
    
        - ehci_hcd 0000:00:01.2: irq 52, pci mem c000000080021000

    [PATCH] USB: Remove inappropriate unusual_devs.h entry
    
    A couple of months ago you applied a patch from Torsten Scherer to create
    a new unusual_devs.h entry.  In further discussions with him I learned
    that the entry wasn't needed to access the device; the only reason for it
    was as a workaround for some old, buggy hotplug program on his system.
    
    Now Evan Fletcher reports that the entry actively prevents him from using
    his device.  For me that's the last straw, so here's a patch to remove the
    entry.  Torsten should be okay if he simply upgrades his hotplug package
    or removes the buggy program.

    [PATCH] USB: OHCI init cleanups
    
    This ought to fix the NS9750 init issue, and make the AMD756 case
    at least somewhat better.  It makes the init go "by the book" in more
    ways, and formalizes one quirk.
    
    Various OHCI init/reset cleanups for different silicion environments:
    
     - Reset a bit more "by the book".
    
        * Define a new quirk flag for the SiS and OPTi problem seen earlier.
          Since 2.4 we've always worked around that quirk, even though we've
          not seen that on other chips; but it's "wrong" and doesn't work on
          some chips (notably NetSilicon NS9750).
    
          The quirk still seems to be needed for SiS, but either this test
          machine is too fast for the OPTi problem to show up, or the frame
          timing setup problem there came from a now-fixed bug.
    
        * Look at the HC state before resetting it; depending on whether
          it was previously owned by BIOS, SMM, an OS, or nobody, different
          USB signaling (and timings) might be needed.
    
        * Re-init the frame timings right after soft reset, rather than
          later (potentially too much later).
    
        * Restore a reset in the PCI startup code, so this logic more closely
          resembles the non-PCI paths (future code sharing).  It also makes it
          easier to guarantee a 1-millisecond ceiling between reset and "go".
    
          An earlier reset is being done to help workaround BIOS-related
          problems on some boards, but we may need an even earlier one
          (as a PCI quirk, before IRQs get reconfigured).
    
     - Add an explicit #define to disable the BIOS/SMM handoff; it's
       not just HPPA, many embedded chips don't expect BIOS either.
    
     - There are reports of AMD 756 machines disliking the OHCI suspend
       patch of a few months back.  Erratum #10 partly explains that, so
       now root hubs won't autosuspend on those Slot-A era chips.
    
     - Other minor fixes
    
        * We've got lots of non-PCI OHCI now too, so comments shouldn't
          be assuming all-is-pci!
    
        * Hey, it's unsafe to call hc_reset() in IRQ (after unrecoverable
          error); so just force a soft reset, don't do the whole thing.
    
    Tested on half a dozen different OHCI versions, but maybe some other
    versions of OHCI will be sensitive to one of these changes.

    [PATCH] USB: Suspend/resume/wakeup support for UHCI root hub ports
    
    This patch adds support for suspending, resuming, and remote wakeup
    detection on root hub ports to the UHCI driver.  It doesn't add support
    for suspending or resuming the root hub itself (beyond what's already
    there) -- that will require considerably more work.  But at least devices
    plugged directly into the computer will interact nicely with power
    management.
    
    Of lesser importance, the patch also simplifies some constant expressions.

    [PATCH] wireless-drivers-update-for-we-17.patch
    
    From: Jean Tourrilhes <jt@bougret.hpl.hp.com>
    
    	This patch complement the main WE-17 patch I just sent you. It
    updates a few driver to take advantage of WE-17. You should queue it
    along with the other patch.
    
    	o Aironet driver :
    		o iwspy data can be shared between eth0 and wifi0 if needed
    		o allow arbitrarily large scan results (no longer limited)
    		o export wireless event capabilities
    	o Wavelan drivers :
    		o export wireless event capabilities

    [PATCH] wireless-extension-v17-for-linus.patch
    
    From: Jean Tourrilhes <jt@bougret.hpl.hp.com>
    
    	This is the patch to migrate Wireless Extension from WE-16 to
    WE-17 for kernel 2.6.X. I would like you to queue that patch and
    submit it to Linus as soon as 2.6.8 is released (so it can be fully
    tested during 2.6.9). If you want, I can resend that as soon as 2.6.8
    is released.
    
    	The patch is basically unchanged compared to the version
    posted to the netdev list and my web page one month ago, I just
    re-diff to the latest kernel (2.6.8-rc2-bk12). The patch already
    included feedback from various driver maintainers, and nobody else
    complained, so I guess it's ready.
    	The patch for some drivers inside the kernel will follow
    (airo.c, wavelan.c, wavelan_cs). Patch for various other drivers
    (orinoco, hostap, prism54) have been sent already to their maintainers
    (one month ago) and basically waiting for this patch.
    
    	Changelog :
     *	- Add flags to frequency -> auto/fixed
     *	- Document (struct iw_quality *)->updated, add new flags (INVALID)
     *	- Wireless Event capability in struct iw_range
     *	- Add support for relative TxPower (yick !)
     *	- Change the way we get to spy_data method for added safety and hostap
     *	- Remove spy #ifdef, they are always on -> cleaner code
     *	- Allow any size GET request if user specifies length > max
     *	- Start migrating get_wireless_stats to struct iw_handler_def
     * Based on patch from Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org> :
     *	- Fix kernel data leak to user space in private handler handling
    
    	I also added on my page a version of Wireless Tools that use
    RtNetlink instead of ioctls. This is not as clean as I would like, but
    is fully functional (if you have WE-19). I know that you were
    interested, so feel free to send feedback on that...
