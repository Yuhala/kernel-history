    [PATCH] Remove fcntl f_op
    
    The newly introduced ->fcntl file_operation is badly thought out,
    not to mention undocumented.  This patch replaces it with two better
    defined operations -- check_flags and dir_notify.  Any other fcntl()s
    that filesystems are interested in can have their own properly typed
    f_op method when they need it.

    [ARM PATCH] 2002/1: lh7a40x Timer fixup
    
    Patch from Marc Singer
    
    The work already done to rectify the timer code initialization missed
    a necessary change.  This patch adds a timer initialization function
    to the LPD7A400 machine type.  It also makes a small correction to the
    kernel configuration that is out of step with the machine specific
    Kconfig.

    Be a bit more anal about allowing SCSI commands to be sent.
    
    Normal users shouldn't have access to the raw device anyway
    unless they are in the trusted "disk" group, but let's require
    RAWIO capabilities. That's what the original SCSI interfaces
    did anyhoo.
    
    We probably _should_ just require write access, but that will
    need more of a code change to pass down the file descriptor.

    * keep reading). If the caller checks the return and itself
    * returns, then it must free memory.
    * However, it is possible to return from mgt_get_request
    * early (!priv->mib). In this case, weird things can happen
    * in isl_ioctl. Quick fix, at least to force an oops, is
    * to set the union value to NULL. The real fix is to

    static char hardirq_stack[NR_CPUS * THREAD_SIZE]  __attribute__((__aligned__(THREAD_SIZE), __section__(".bss.page_aligned")));
    
    Removing the __section__() fixes it, as does moving to gcc 3.2 or 3.3,
    but gcc 2.95 and 3.0 still exhibit the problem.  It seems the 4k stack
    developers like newer compilers than I do :)
    
    The gcc 2.95 section declaration looks like this:
    	.section        .bss.page_aligned,"aw",@progbits
    while the 3.1 section looks like this:
    	.section        .bss.page_aligned,"aw",@nobits
    
    It's definitely a bug that's been fixed:
    http://sources.redhat.com/ml/binutils/2002-10/msg00507.html
    
    I've been told that I can fix it with a carefully crafted assembly file and
    maybe a change to the linker script, but all that it buys us is a little
    space in the uncompressed kernel image.  Plus, the warning will still be
    there at compile-time.
    
    I say, put them back in plain old BSS.

    [PATCH] via-rhine: Really call rhine_power_init()
    
    Without this patch, mainline via-rhine cannot wake the chip if some other
    driver puts it to D3. The problem has hit quite a few people already.
    
    This is a fix for the heisenbug with via-rhine refusing to work
    sometimes. Patch "[9/9] Restructure reset code" contained a change made
    necessary by patch [8/9]. Mainline merged [8/9] for 2.6.8 and is still
    missing the fix, while -mm got it with [9/9].
    
    Jesper Juhl provided crucial test data when no one else was able to
    reproduce the symptoms.

    Fix up sound driver proc-reading interfaces.
    
    The old ones were not only hard to use, they were in fact
    impossible or a low-level sound driver to get right, since
    the core sound code didn't even export all the necessary
    information.
    
    Add the file offset to the /proc read interfaces, and make
    them simpler to use. The core now does a offset updates, and
    sanity-checks the values so that the low-level drivers don't
    need to worry.

    [PATCH] adjust SG reserved size automatically
    
    The block layer SG should have the identical behaviour as SCSI sg when
    it comes to SG_SET_RESERVED_SIZE - allow caller to specify a large
    amount, truncate to largest we support, and return that with
    SG_GET_RESERVED_SIZE.  Currently we fail with -EINVAL if the value is
    too large, I think the SCSI sg behaviour is more sane to use.  This
    one-liner fixes it up, please apply for 2.6.8.

    Remove ESPIPE logic from drivers, letting the VFS layer handle it instead.
    
    This cleans up and simplifies drivers, and also allows us future
    simplification in the VFS layer, since it removes knowledge about
    internal VFS layer handling of "f_pos".

    Make sysctl pass the pos pointer around properly.
    
    Nobody ever fixed the big FIXME in sysctl - but we really need
    to pass around the proper "loff_t *" to all the sysctl functions
    if we want them to be well-behaved wrt the file pointer position.
    
    This is all preparation for making direct f_pos accesses go
    away.

     - conversion to seq_file, overflow fixes

    [PATCH] sparc32: gcc-3.3 macro parenthesization fix for memcpy.S
    
    From: Art Haas <ahaas@airmail.net>
    
    The 1.3->1.4 changes to the arch/sparc/lib/copy_user.S file added parenthesis
    to a number of macros within that file.  The BK changlog associated with this
    change indicate the change was to make the file work with gcc-3.3.
    
    When looking at the changes made, I see that similar macros exist in memcpy.S
    as well, so would a patch adding parens to that file be worthwhile?  Also,
    just what was the problem with gcc-3.3 that was resolved by adding the
    parenthesis?  Macro mis-expansion I'm guessing.

    [PATCH] jbd: journal_head unmapping race fix
    
    Fix a race identified by Chris Mason <mason@suse.com>
    
    journal_unmap_buffer -> __dispose_buffers has the j_list_lock and the
    jbd_lock_bh_state held.
    
    journal_get_write_access calls journal_put_journal_head, which takes
    jbd_lock_bh_journal_head(bh) and doesn't seem to have any other locks held.
    
    Since journal_unmap_buffers trusts the buffer_jbd bit to see if we need to
    call __dispose_buffer, and nobody seems to test buffer_jbd after taking
    jbd_lock_bh_journal_head.  The kernel dereferences a null jh pointer in
    __journal_remove_journal_head.
    
    
    The patch fixes this by using journal_grab_journal_head() in
    journal_unmap_buffer().  It ensures that we either grab and pin the
    journal_head if the bh has one, or we bale out if the bh doesn't have a
    journal_head.

    [PATCH] Restore PPP filtering
    
    Karsten Keil's patch entitled "[ISDN]: Fix kernel PPP/IPPP active/passiv
    filter code" that went in back in April was an attempt to solve a real
    problem - namely that the libpcap maintainers have removed useful
    functionality that pppd was using - but his fix broke existing pppd
    binaries and IMO didn't end up actually solving the problem.
    
    This patch reverts the change to ppp_generic.c so that existing pppd
    binaries work again.  I am going to have to work out a proper fix, which
    may involve further changes to ppp_generic.c, but I will make sure existing
    pppd binaries still work.

    [PATCH] kbuild: Remove LANG preset in top-level Makefile
    
    In the top-level Makefile a number of locale related environment
    variables were preset to give a small speed up when building the kernel.
    
    Unfortunately this had the bad sideeffect that the variable
    CFLAGS_vmlinux.lds.o lost the exported vaule in some setups (obviously
    not mine).  This smells like a make issue - but the best solution is
    simply to drop presetting the locale related variables.

    [PATCH] Fix ppc htab seq_file conversion

    Wrong diff sent.  Sorry - normally the tree I'm working in is cp -rl'ed
    from the -current, but right now it's a big mess.
    
    This is the incremental fix.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix rtas file mess
    
    This does the seq_file conversion + annotation + cleanup + race fixes
    for arch/ppc64/kernel/rtas-proc.c.
    
    How the fuck did that file manage to get anywhere near the tree, anyway?
    Take a look at guy's "implementation" of sprintf(buf, "%04d", num), for
    example:
    
    <vomit>
    	/* construct the sensor number like 0003 */
    	/* fill with zeros */
    	n = sprintf(tmp, "%d", s.token);
    	len = strlen(tmp);
    	while (strlen(tmp) < 4)
    		n += sprintf (tmp+n, "0");
    
    	/* invert the string */
    	while (tmp[i]) {
    		if (i<len)
    			tmp2[4-len+i] = tmp[i];
    		else
    			tmp2[3-i] = tmp[i];
    		i++;
    	}
    	tmp2[4] = '\0';
    </vomit>
    
    And it's full of that level of lusing ;-/

    It would potentially remove dentries from the LRU list
    without re-initializing the d_lru fields, causing later
    accesses to that dentry to do bad things to the LRU list.

    I just stumbled across this patch that's been sitting in my tree for ages.
    
    I thought I'd sent this in before.  It's a trivial fix for the printing
    of task state in /proc and sysrq dumps and such, so that TASK_DEAD shows
    up correctly.  This state is pretty much only ever there to be seen when
    there are exit/reaping bugs, but it's not like that hasn't come up.

    [ARM PATCH] 1965/1: gas only generates the c and f field bits for the "msr [cs]psr, rN" instruction
    
    Patch from Catalin Marinas
    
    Gas translates the "msr [cs]psr, rN" instruction to "msr [cs]psr_cf, rN". This may cause problems on the ARMv6 architecture where the A and E bits can leak into the SVC mode from the USR mode via the exception handlers. The reverse can happen when returning to user mode. The patch adds _cxsf to all the msr instruction without the field specifier.

    [PATCH] md multipathing fixes
    
    I tried to get multipathing failover running and failed. It seems to be
    that there are two bugs in multipath.c :
    
    - If a path/request fails mp_bh->path doesn't get updated to the new
      path.  Thus multipath_end_request will access a NULL pointer if a
      redirected request returns.
    
    - After fixing this I experienced several other errors.  First of all in
      bio->bi_flags the BIO_UPTODATE flag is not set when redirecting a
      request.
    
      Causing the md driver to think that every redirected request failed
      when it returns.  Since that alone didn't fix the problems, I simply
      copied the master_bio again and it looks like everything seems to work.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Start the FCU in therm_pm72.c
    
    Some G5 recent powermacs start with the fan control unit (FCU) disabled,
    by the firmware, causing the thermal control driver to break. We have to
    enable it before starting the feedback loops that set the fan speeds.
    This patch adds the code to start the FCU.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Fix problem with spurrious edge interrupts on old
    
    On old powermacs, it's possible that we get a stale edge interrupt when
    doing request_irq(), that typically happens with the DBDMA controller
    interrupts when the device was used by the firmware for booting.
    
    I just tracked down a nasty memory corruption problem where that was
    causing the bmac driver to try to process packets before the driver
    internal data structures were properly initialized.
    
    While I agree that the driver should (and will) be made more robust to
    such things, Paulus and I decided that it makes little sense to keep
    track of an "old" edge interrupt that happens before a driver does
    request_irq.  (On those powermacs, those are only the DBDMA interrupts
    anyway, and none of the DBDMA users will care).
    
    This patch implements a "startup" handler for the old Apple PIC that
    will "ack" pending edge interrupts before unmasking, thus preventing
    those stale interrupts to be delivered.
    
    It also "fixes" the ppc32 irq core to call the startup() callback when
    available instead of just calling enable().

    [PATCH] bio_copy_user() cleanups and fixes
    
    blk_rq_map_user() is a bit of a hack currently, since it drops back to
    kmalloc() if bio_map_user() fails.  This is unfortunate since it means we
    do no real segment or size checking (and the request segment counts contain
    crap, already found one bug in a scsi lld).  It's also pretty nasty for >
    PAGE_SIZE requests, as we attempt to do higher order page allocations.
    Even worse still, ide-cd will drop back to PIO for non-sg/bio requests.
    All in all, very suboptimal.
    
    This patch adds bio_copy_user() which simply sets up a bio with kernel
    pages and copies data as needed for reads and writes.  It also changes
    bio_map_user() to return an error pointer like bio_copy_user(), so we can
    return something sane to the user instead of always -ENOMEM.

    [PATCH] FAT: kill nls default
    
    Previously, fatfs was using NLS_DEFAULT if users didn't specify the
    codepage or iocharset option.  This became cause of trouble (filename
    access).
    
    This patch removes the complicated default config in kernel.
    
    Instead of it, by default, fatfs uses builtin nls ("default"), also reports
    it and mounts as read-only.  This default will limit the access more or
    less.  Note: If peoples want to write on this default, it still can switch
    by remount.
    
    Therefore, basically users will need to specify mount options always.
    ("codepage" for msdos, and "codepage" and "iocharset" for vfat) However, it
    can be done simply by script or shell alias or something else in userland.
    
    Thanks to Andries Brouwer for your many advice.

    [PATCH] Off-by-one error for SIGXCPU / RLIMIT_CPU checking
    
    There is a lonstanding off-by-one error that results from an incorrect
    comparison when checking whether a process has consumed CPU time in
    excess of its RLIMIT_CPU limits.
    
    This means, for example, that if we use setrlimit() to set the soft CPU
    limit (rlim_cur) to 5 seconds and the hard limit (rlim_max) to 10 seconds,
    then the process only receives a SIGXCPU signal after consuming 6 seconds
    of CPU time, and, if it continues consuming CPU after handling that
    signal, only receives SIGKILL after consuming 11 seconds of CPU time.
    
    The fix is trivial.

    [PATCH] MSI: stop using dev->bus->ops directly in msi.c
    
    First half of the MSI rewrite: pure cleanup.  Use proper
    pci_read_config_xxx() and pci_write_config_xxx() functions instead of
    accessing raw dev->bus->ops.

    [PATCH] quieten down per-zone memory stats
    
    On a system with a lot of nodes, 4 lines of output per node is a lot to
    have to sit through as the system comes up, especially if you're on the
    other end of a slow serial link.  The information is valuable though, so
    keep it around for the system logger.  This patch makes the printks for the
    memory stats use KERN_DEBUG instead of the default loglevel.

    [PATCH] ppc64: improve SLB reload
    
    Rewrite/cleanup of the SLB management code.  This removes nearly all the
    SLB related code from arch/ppc64/kernel/stab.c and puts a rewritten version
    in arch/ppc64/mm, where it better belongs.  The main SLB miss path is in
    assembler and the other routines have been cleaned up and streamlined.
    
    Notable changes:
    
    - Ugly bitfields no longer used for generating SLB entries.
    
    - slb_allocate() (the main SLB miss routine) is now in assembler, and all
      the data it uses is stored in the PACA.
    
    - The mm context is now copied into the PACA at context switch time, to
      avoid looking up the thread struct on SLB miss.
    
    - An SLB miss will now never (directly) result in a call to
      do_page_fault.  If we get a miss on a totally bogus address the handler
      will now put in an SLB referencing VSID 0.  This will never have any
      pages, so we'll get the (fatal) page fault shortly afterwards.  This
      simplifies the SLB entry and exit paths.
    
    - The round-robin pointer in the PACA now references the last-used
      instead of next-to-use SLB slot, which simplifies the asm for updating it
      slightly.
    
    - Unify do_slb_bolted with the general SLB miss path.  There is now one
      SLB miss handler, in assembler, and called with only the low-level
      exception prolog (EXCEPTION_PROLOG_[PI]SERIES rather than
      EXCEPTION_PROLOG_COMMON) and minimal extra save/restore logic.
    
    - Streamlines the exception entry/exit path of the SLB miss handler to
      shave a few cycles off.  The most significant change is that the RI bit
      is left off throughout the whole handler, which avoids an extra mtmsrd to
      turn it back off on the exit path.

    [PF_KEY]: spirange should be in host byte order.
    
    I'm looking through the xfrm_alloc_spi stuff and noticed that the
    netlink alloc_spi function takes the range in host order while the
    PFKEY alloc_spi function takes them in network order.
    
    First I thought that I stuffed up since I was the one who changed
    the code in the netlink interface to take them in host order :)
    
    But reading RFC 2367 seems to indicate otherwise.  It says that all
    fields are host order unless specified otherwise.  And the spirange
    fields are not specified to be network order at all.
    
    Looking at the existing PFKEY users:
    
    User Space
    ----------
    Openswan - Doesn't use PFKEY for this.
    Racoon - Puts zeros in there so it doesn't care.  However its test-pfkey
    	 program stores things in host order.
    ISAKMPD - Stores things in host order.
    
    So the conclusion is that we can and should change our PFKEY
    implementation to use host order for these fields.
    
    This patch does exactly that.

    [IPSEC]: xfrm_alloc_spi always succeeds on non-trivial range
    
    xfrm_alloc_spi will always succeed if minspi < maxspi, even if
    minspi + 1 == maxspi.  If the range is already occupied this
    will obviously lead to breakage.
    
    Of course this is very unlikely to occur in reality due to the
    size of the range.  Although with IPCOMP it might actually happen
    on a very large server.
    
    The fix is obivous.

    [IPSEC]: Remove redundant check in xfrm_state_add()
    
    This is the patch referred to in the netlink_get_spi thread.
    
    I was actually wrong about the reason for this patch though.  Firstly
    it's the SPI check that is redundant and not the find_acq() call.
    And it's redundant because of the find_acq() patch, not because
    of the fact that this is in xfrm_state_add().
    
    Now that find_acq() only returns SAs with SPIs, we don't need to
    check this in xfrm_state_add() anymore.
    
    We do still need the call though to clean up leftover larval states.
    
    Another side-effect of the change is that we can move the existence
    check above find_acq() since find_acq() will never return any SAs
    matching the SPI we're trying to add (It doesn't need to because if
    an SA with a matching SPI existed, it would've been returned by
    state_lookup() already).

    [IPSEC]: Fix SPI generation by netlink_get_spi()
    
    The issue is that two successive calls to netlink_get_spi is returning
    the same SA.  Since netlink_get_spi is meant to be a creation operation
    this is incorrect.
    
    The netlink_get_spi operation is modelled off the PFKEY SADB_GETSPI
    command which is specified in RFC 2367.  The purpose of SADB_GETSPI
    is to create a new larval SA that can then be filled in by SADB_UPDATE.
    
    Its semantics does not allow two SADB_GETSPI calls to return the same
    SA, even if there is no SADB_UPDATE call in between.
    
    The reason the second netlink_get_spi is returning the same SA is
    because in find_acq(), the code is looking at all larval states as
    opposed to only larval states with an SPI of zero.
    
    Since the only other caller of find_acq() -- xfrm_state_add() intentionally
    ignores all return values with a non-zero SPI, it is safe to not look at
    SAs with non-zero SPIs at all in find_acq().
    
    The following patch does exactly that.
    
    In fact, the find_acq() call in xfrm_state_add() is a remnant from
    the days when we had xfrm_state_replace() instead of xfrm_state_add()
    and xfrm_state_update().  It can now be safely removed.
    
    I'll post a separate patch for that.

    [Bluetooth] Fix resetting to default filters
    
    The problem is that after a successful connection between the Windows
    Bluetooth stack and the Linux Bluez stack, no packets from the device
    ever reach the PC running Windows XP Service Pack 2. That is, a ping
    from the PC never receives a response, and a ping from BlueZ never
    reaches the PC. Linux packet statistics show that the PC packets are
    received, but all return traffic seems to be routed over the loopback
    interface.
    
    Immediately after creating the BNEP connection with BlueZ, the Windows
    Bluetooth stack sends a BNEP_FILTER_NET_TYPE_SET_MSG with an effective
    length of zero. BlueZ interprets this message to mean that no filter
    ranges should be allowed. The code zeros the first entry in the filter
    list, which is than interpreted as meaning that no ranges of acceptable
    packets are available. This interpretation is wrong and leads to all
    packets being rejected by BNEP.
    
    The Bluetooth BNEP specification clearly states the following:
    
    The length (in octets) of this message is 4+4*N, where N is the number
    of disjoint ranges of Networking protocol types that form the complete
    set. Note that N=0 (empty set) denotes a reset to default filters (if
    any) supported by the remote device.

    [PATCH] PATCH: Fix HPT366 crash and support HPT372N
    
    On a board containing the HPT372N IDE controller the 2.6.x series kernels will
    misbehave. If the HPT372N is set up with the newer PCI identifier it is
    ignored. If it is set up with the HPT372 identifier then the kernel crashes
    on boot.
    
    This patch is a forward port of my 2.4 driver fixes that have been in 2.4
    for a year but somehow escaped 2.6. Ronny Buchmann caught a couple
    of merge details I missed and those are fixed in this diff too.
    
    As well as adding 372N support this also fixes the unknown revision case
    to avoid crashes should any future 37x variants with weird class_rev's appear

    [PATCH] slab memory shrinking balancing fix
    
    The logic in shrink_slab tries to balance the proportion of slab which it
    scans against the proportion of pagecache which the caller scanned.  Problem
    is that with a large number of highmem LRU pages and a small number of lowmem
    LRU pages, the amount of pagecache scanning appears to be very small, so we
    don't push slab hard enough.
    
    The patch changes things so that for, say, a GFP_KERNEL allocation attempt we
    only consider ZONE_NORMAL and ZONE_DMA when calculating "what proportion of
    the LRU did the caller just scan".
    
    This will have the effect of shrinking slab harder in response to GFP_KERNEL
    allocations than for GFP_HIGHMEM allocations.

    [PATCH] ppc32: fix compilation with binutils-2.15
    
    Currently, ppc32 will not always compile with binutils-2.15.  The issue
    is that binutils has become even more strict about which opcodes can be
    used with which CPU flags.  The problem is that we have a number of
    cases where we compile with altivec instructions (with runtime checks to
    make sure we can actually run them) in code that's not altivec specific.
    
    The fix for this is to always pass in -maltivec on CONFIG_6xx.  To do
    this cleanly, we split our AFLAGS definition up into
    aflags-$(CONFIG_FOO).

    bte.c:
      After working with the chip designer some more, we have determined one
      more hardware register we were supposed to write to ensure the SHUB
      chip was ready for future transfers.  This patch fixes that.  This also
      allowed us to eliminate a udelay which was working around the problem.
    
      During retesting, we uncovered a race condition where transfer status
      was changed by a different cpu after we were expecting one value which
      cascaded to additional problems.  This patch uses a local variable to
      also eliminate that race.

    fb_set_cmap() and fb_copy_cmap() split into kernel and userland versions.
    fb_cmap, fb_image and fb_cursor split and annotated.
    fixed bug in sbuslib.c that used to call "userland" version of fb_set_cmap()
    when kernel one was need (RGB data was already copied into kernel space).

    [PATCH] fbcon_do_set_font() sanitized
    
    	fbcon internal cleanup.  Instead of passing console_font_op into
    fbcon_do_set_font() we pass width/height directly.  Amusing (but harmless)
    bug fixed there:
    	if (!w > 32) {
    		bogus code that fortunately never got triggered
    	}
    Fixed by removal of the junk in question (and yes, it's verifiable junk -
    it would not do anything even if we replaced the check with intended
    !(w > 32)).

    [PATCH] con_set_font sanitized
    
    con_font_set() sanitized.  We are passing console_font and flags into
    the method in separate arguments and we are not messing with
    console_font_op->data anymore - it's a userland pointer (to be annotated
    several patches later in the series, due to another abuse of console_font_op
    that needs to be fixed first), while console_font->data is kernel one
    and they don't mix anymore.
    
    We also do a sanity check (font width > 0) in the caller instead of
    method instances, since we are already checking for width <= 32 and
    height <= 32 there; doesn't make sense leaving that one in method
    instances.

    is normally used for font height - messy even for an ioctl, but that animal
    used to be passed all the way down into console drivers).
    
    With decoding done in con_font_copy(), we simply pass source console number
    into the method.

    [PATCH] con_font_op split
    
    Preparations for cleanups: con_font_op() is turned into a switch calling
    con_font_{get,set,default,copy} depending on the operation required;
    method ->con_font_op() also split, with NULL resulting in -ENOSYS on
    operation in question.
    
    Code that used to be in con_font_op() got slightly cleaned up after move
    into new helpers (we are beginning to untangle the mess; there will be
    more cleanups in the next patches).
    
    Methods are currently using exact same arguments as old ->con_font_op().
    That will change in subsequent patches, method by method (right now there's
    a hell of a scary field reuse between them, making impossible to do any
    static checks and practically begging for bugs).

    [NET]: Allow MD5 to be a module
    
    I found that recent 2.6 kernels no longer allowed me to build MD5 as
    a module even though everything that used it were modules (including
    ipv6 and sctp).  It turns out that there were boolean options
    selecting MD5 in the Kconfig files.  Due to limitations in the current
    kconfig implementation, this forces MD5 to be a boolean as well.
    
    The usual workaround in these cases is to move the selection up
    to the closest tristate.  This is what the following patch does.

    [PATCH] writepages drops bh on not uptodate page
    
    I think I understood why some ext2 fs corruption still happens even after
    the last i_size fix.
    
    what happened I believe is that the writepages layer got a not a fully
    uptodate page (in turn with bh mapped on top of it), and then right before
    unlocking the page and entering the writeback mode, it freed all the bh.
    Without bh a not uptodate page will trigger a full readpage from disk, that
    overwrites the pagecache before the multi-bio gets submitted, generating fs
    corruption.
    
    I believe the below patch should fix it (untested) against kernel CVS.
    
    The testcases developed by Kurt showed the pagecache being overwritten with
    on-disk data at block offsets, and Chris as well was wondering about races
    between wait_on_page_writeback and readpage.  the below fix just explains
    everything we've seen since not-fully-uptodate pages must have always bh on
    them and the below patch enforces just that invariant, and it should fix
    our pagecache-overwritten-by-disk-data problem.

    [PATCH] Add documentation about /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode to various docs.
    
    From: Bart Samwel <bart@samwel.tk>
    
    A bunch of small laptop mode updates:
    
    * Mention the laptop_mode and block_dump sysctls in the relevant docs,
      referring to the laptop-mode.txt. Improve description of what the
      laptop_mode knob means (i.e. seconds between last I/O and automatic
      sync).
    
    * Document the most relevant config file options.
    
    * Change the installation instructions in the laptop mode doc to describe
      the ACPI-bound version first, because this is the easiest. Explain
      the non-ACPI version afterwards. Added a reference to my "packaged
      version" of the scripts.
    
    * Move the setting of hdparm and cpu frequency out of the ACPI script
      and into the core laptop mode script. Add config option DO_HD to
      enable hdparm. Add config setting HD to set device to do hdparm on.
      Rename Dax's CPU_MANAGE to DO_CPU, with 0/1 instead of yes/no, to
      improve consistency.
    
    * Fix a problem where the root filesystem wouln't be remounted when
      /etc/mtab listed its type as "unknown". Deduce the type of "unknown"
      filesystems from /etc/fstab.
    
    This depends on the patch that adds config files, which was submitted
    to Linus by Dax Kelson on July 10.

    [PATCH] Config file for laptop mode.

    Add support for a external configuration file for /sbin/laptop_mode, and
    /etc/acpi/actions/battery.sh.  Convert battery.sh to use CPUFreq (off by
    default) instead of CPU throttling (that was off by default).
    
    Cleanup some formating for 80 columns.

    Lake City on July 9th.  :)
    
    (Note from Bart Samwel: was submitted to Linus earlier, this patch is

    [PATCH] front buttons wouldn't mute ESS Maestro
    
    Here is a small fix to enable muting ESS Maestro sound card thanks to the
    up/down buttons: when has reached the driver's minimum (!  this is
    something like -dB value), just mute.  (It was working in OSS driver, but
    not in ALSA)

    [PATCH] hlist_for_each_safe cleanup
    
    Make code for hlist_for_each_safe use better code (same as
    hlist_for_each_entry_safe).  Get rid of comment about prefetch, because
    that was fixed a while ago.  Only current use of this is in the bridge
    code, that I maintain.

    [PATCH] Export all functions in lib/string.c
    
    Quite a few functions in lib/string.c are not exported.  I ran into this
    trying to use strnchr() in a module.
    
    This patch
     - exports every function defined in lib/string.c
     - adds some missing __HAVE_ARCH_xxx defines for i386
     - gets rid of the exports of functions from lib/string.c in arch/s390
       (BTW, why is s390 exporting things NOVERS?)

    [PATCH] fix readahead breakage for sequential after random reads
    
    Current readahead logic is broken when a random read pattern is followed by
    a long sequential read.  The cause is that on a window miss ra->next_size
    is set to ra->average, but ra->average is only updated at the end of a
    sequence, so window size will remain 1 until the end of the sequential
    read.
    
    This patch fixes this by taking the current sequence length into account
    (code taken from towards end of page_cache_readahead()), and also setting
    ra->average to a decent value in handle_ra_miss() when sequential access is
    detected.

    [PATCH] ipmi_msghandler module load failure fix
    
    On a 2.6.7 kernel, when I try to modprobe ipmi_msghandler, it fails to load
    with following message:
    
    FATAL: Error inserting ipmi_msghandler (/lib/modules/2.6.7/kernel/drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_msghandler.ko): Invalid module format
    
    And there is an error message in dmesg:
    
    ipmi_msghandler: init symbol 0xa000000200058080 used in module code at a000000200031b32
    
    What I have been able to determine is that ipmi_msghandler.c defines
    ipmi_init_msghandler() as the module_init() routine and then it also calls
    ipmi_init_msghandler() diretcly from couple of other places.  This does not
    seem to be okay in 2.6.7 kernel.  I was able to fix this by defining a new
    module_init routine which in turn calls ipmi_init_msghandler().  I also
    removed __init from ipmi_init_msghandler() since it gets called from
    ipmi_open() on an open of the ipmi device file.  So I would think we want
    to keep ipmi_init_msghandler() around even after initialization.

    Changeset
    
      roland@redhat.com[torvalds]|ChangeSet|20040624165002|30880
    
    inadvertently broke ia64 because the patch assumed that pgd_offset_k() is
    just an optimization of pgd_offset(), which it is not.  This patch fixes
    the problem by introducing pgd_offset_gate().  On architectures on which
    the gate area lives in the user's address-space, this should be aliased to
    pgd_offset() and on architectures on which the gate area lives in the
    kernel-mapped segment, this should be aliased to pgd_offset_k().
    
    This bug was found and tracked down by Peter Chubb.

      New file added to wrap ppc64 architecture specific firmware calls for
      use by HVCS.  This file provides a struct hvcs_partner_info definition,
      headers for partner info gathering and vterm connection and termination
      interfaces.
    
    * arch/ppc64/kernel/Makefile
    
      Added build directive for hvcserver.o when HVCS is configured.
    
    * arch/ppc64/kernel/hvconsole.c
    
      Exported hvc_put_chars() and hvc_get_chars() for use by HVCS.
    
    * arch/ppc64/kernel/hvcserver.c
    
      Body of hvcserver module which accompanies the hvcs module and provides
      ppc64 architecture firmware calls for use by HVCS.  This file provides
      function bodies for partner info gathering and vterm connection and
      termination interfaces.
    
    * drivers/char/Kconfig
    
      Added CONFIG_HVCS option for both built-in version and module version
      of hvcs.
    
    * drivers/char/Makefile
    
      Added build directive for hvcs.o when CONFIG_HVCS is configured.
    
    * drivers/char/hvcs.c
    
      This is the device driver for the IBM Hypervisor Virtual Console
      Server, "hvcs".  The IBM hvcs provides a tty driver interface to allow
      Linux user space applications access to the system consoles of logically
      partitioned operating systems, e.g.  Linux, running on the same
      partitioned Power5 ppc64 system.  Physical hardware consoles per
      partition are not practical on this hardware so system consoles are
      accessed by this driver using inter-partition firmware interfaces to
      virtual terminal devices.
    
    * Documentation/powerpc/hvcs.txt
    
      HVCS installation and usage documentation.
    
    Thanks everyone for all the help with this driver [Andrew Morton, Paul
    Mackerras, Ben Herrenschmidt, Dave Hansen, Paul Mackerras, Dave Boutcher,
    Hollis Blanchard, Santiago Leon, Brian King, Randy Dunlap].

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix RAS irq handlers
    
    On pSeries systems, the firmware tells us a list of interrupt numbers
    that we should enable in order to detect various error conditions.
    When we get one of these interrupts we are supposed to call the
    firmware, which will work out and tell us what the error was and
    possibly also fix it.
    
    We were not correctly parsing the property values that tell us which
    interrupts need to be handled in this fashion.  This patch fixes it.
    It exports prom_n_intr_cells from prom.c since that is needed to do
    the parsing properly.

    [PATCH] ppc64: cpu hotplug fix
    
    On Power4 and earlier hardware there is no need to clear the CPPR (see RPAp
    479 section 18.5.4.7.2 for what little info there is on the CPPR) when
    stopping a cpu.  On hardware that uses Power5 an undocumented change has
    been made that requires the CPPR to be cleared if an isolate is to be done
    on the stopped cpu.  So the following patch lets cpu hotplug work on the
    recent hardware.
    
    I sent this patch to the ppc64-dev list back in mid April and Suse picked
    it up then for SLES9 so it has been well tested for several months.

    ppc64 has an optimisation where it loops on get_irq until there are no more
    interrupts to be handled.  Mark Hack notes that this optimisation hardly
    ever hits and costs us a potentially expensive extra read of an interrupt
    register every interrupt.
    
    Also make do_IRQ void, the callers never use the return value.

    [PATCH] page align emergency stack
    
    The PPC64 ABI requires the stack to be 128 byte aligned (and that can
    become important if AltiVec registers are saved there).  In the kernel,
    that's usually dealt with by the fact that the stack has a page
    more-or-less to itself.  However, the emergency stacks (used in SMP bringup
    and when we detect a bad stack pointer) aren't necessarily page aligned, or
    anything aligned for that matter.  This patch applies the necessary
    alignement constraint to them.

    [PATCH] DVB major number
    
    The DVB merge forgot an important change - DVB is currently using
    major 250, which is "local" while devices.txt (and thus FSSTND/LSB) require
    it uses the officially allocated 212 major.
    
    Fortunately most 2.6 users don't currently use DVB and vendors ship devfs
    or versions of makedev that do the right thing and generate 212 majors.

    [PATCH] swapoff mmap_sem deadlock
    
    Updating the mm lock ordering documentation drew attention to the fact that
    we were wrong to blithely add down_read(&mm->mmap_sem) to swapoff's
    unuse_process, while it holds swapcache page lock: not very likely, but it
    could deadlock against, say, mlock faulting a page back in from swap.
    
    But it looks like these days it's safe to drop and reacquire page lock if
    down_read_trylock fails: the page lock is held to stop try_to_unmap
    unmapping the page's ptes as fast as try_to_unuse is mapping them back in;
    but the recent fix for get_user_pages works to prevent that too.

    [PATCH] install_page vs. vmtruncate
    
    BK is still missing one piece for Oleg's install_page/vmtruncate races.
    Oleg didn't explicitly ACK this, but I think he did implicitly: Oleg?
    
    The previous patch to install_page, returning an error if !page_mapping
    once page_table_lock is held, is not enough to guard against vmtruncate.
    
    When unmap_mapping_range already did this vma, but truncate_inode_pages has
    not yet done this page, page->mapping will still be set, but we must now
    refrain from inserting the page into the page table.
    
    Could check truncate_count, but that would need caller to read and pass it
    down.  Instead, recheck page->index against i_size, which is updated before
    unmap_mapping_range.  Better check page->mapping too: not really necessary,
    but it's accidental that index is left when mapping is reset.
    
    Also, callers are expecting -EINVAL for beyond end of file, not -EAGAIN.

    Kernel crashes when you try to offline a cpu, not surprisingly.
    
    It also looks like rcu_move_batch isn't preempt-safe so I touched that up,
    and got rid of an unused label in rcu_offline_cpu.

    [sound/oss i810] misc small changes
    
    Attached is a second patch to account for (most of) Herbert Xu's
    comments.
    
    I have left-out the part about changing state->card to a
    local variable where it is used a lot.  Unfortunately, that usage is
    somewhat pervasive and I would prefer to make those changes in a separate
    patch -- after I have had a chance to do some testing.
    
    If you'd prefer one patch to account for the original plus these
    changes, let me know and I'll be happy to provide it.

    [sound/oss i810] add MMIO DSP support
    
    Enclosed is a patch for the i810_audio OSS driver to support using
    memory-mapped I/O for those chipsets that support it.
    
     o Added a family of macros -- I810_IOREADx() and I810_IOWRITEx() -- that
    key off the existing card->use_mmio flag to select between using readx/writex
    or inx/outx for I/O operations.
    
     o Converted existing inx/outx invocations to use
    I810_IOREADx/I810_IOWRITEx instead.
    
     o Changed GET_CIV(), GET_LVI, and CIV_TO_LVI() not only to use
    I810_IOREADx/I810_IOWRITEx but also to take "card" (i.e. struct i810_card)
    paramter.
    
     o Removed check for "Pure MMIO interfaces" in i810_probe() -- replaced w/
    (relocated) check for no I/O resources available.

    kbuild: Introduce source symlink in /lib/modules/.../
    
    Traditionally when building a kernel the source and the
    output files are mixed.
    
    When building a kernel using the O= syntax to save output
    files in a separate directory a way is needed to locate
    the kernel source.
    The implemented solution is a new symlink 'source' being
    added to /lib/modules/.../
    used to locate source for an installed kernel.
    The original symlink build points to the directory
    containing the output files.
    
    Please note that when the kernel is build with source and
    output files mixed the two symlinks 'build' and 'source'
    will point to the same directory, thus no changes
    compared to before.
    
    Two options was considered:
                                                                                                          a) Adding a new symlink pointing to the output files "object"
            => All external modules have to specify O= to build
            => External modules grepping in .config or .h files
               in include/asm needs to be updated
            => External modules that do grep in source code and
               ordinary header files just works
    
    b) Let the build symlink point to the output files and introduce a new
       symlink "source" pointing to the kernel source
            => External module can be build without specifying O=
            => External modules grepping in .config or .h files
               in include/asm just works
            => External modules that do grep in source code and
               ordinary header files needs to be updated
    
    Based on the above option b) is considered the least painfull alternative.
    
    So to sum up:
    - If a distro does not use separate output dir => no change
    - If a distro uses separate output dir =>
            - Trivial external module just builds
            - Non-trivial (build-wise) external modules are probarly broken
    
    Without this patch
    - If a distro does not use separate output dir => no change
    - If a distro uses separate output dir =>
            - Trivial external modules had to specify O= to build,
              and the directory being pointed at was not obvious
            - grep in .config or include files in asm/ required
              knowledge where to locate output files
    
    Preferred syntax for building external modules are the following:
    
           make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build M=`pwd`
    
    [Substituting 'M=...' with 'SUBDIRS=... modules' give same effect].
    
    When the kernel is built using separate output directory the above
    invocation of make will invoke the generated Makefile located in the output
    directory - that again will invoke the Makefile located in the kernel
    source tree root.

    [AH6]: Get things working again.
    
    Re: [AH6] Disable mutable bits after AH header
    
    Unfortunately I broke ah6_input() in that patch.  Thanks to Miyazawa-san
    for notifying me of the problem.
    
    In that patch I removed the nh_offset parameter to ipv6_clear_mutable_options.
    That broke ah6_input() because it relies on that variable to set the nexthdr.
    
    The following patch fixes this by moving this work out to the caller
    xfrm6_rcv() where the information is already available.  It also removes
    an unnecessary call to ip6_find_1stfragopt() in xfrm6_rcv() since nhoffp
    already points to the nexthdr preceding the current header.

    kbuild: Create Makefile in output directory if != kernel tree
    
    When building a kernel using the O= syntax to save output
    files in a separate output directory now create a small Makefile in
    that same dir.
    This Makefile allow one to use make in the output directory without
    the hassle of going back to the kernel source tree.
    The O= option is added by this Makefile stub.
    Please note that the Makefile silently overwrite an old one, so changes
    will be lost if modified.
    If there is a need to tweak a Makefile in the output directory it is recommended
    to use the filename 'makefile', which GNU Make will try first.

    That breaks quite a few drivers that should otherwise work on ppc.  SR...
    and LR were never used by ppc code; commented out in reg.h (note that
    they are just aliases for SPRN_SR... and SPRN_LR).  RPA commented out and
    its instances in ppc code (all four of them) replaced with SPRN_RPA.  Ditto
    for DEC.  The rest of the offenders (DAR and PVR) are left alone for now and
    #undef'ed in drivers in question.
    
    We probably want to rip all these guys out of reg.h and convert ppc users
    to SPRN_... forms - file ends up included in alot of places and namespace
    pollution like that is a Bad Thing(tm).

    [PATCH] pointer-to-int conversion fixes
    
    Assorted pointer-to-int fixes:
    	a) some places want to take pointer modulo alignment or extract
    integer that was cast to pointer (which is legitimate), but do that via
    wrong cast, triggering sparse warnings.
    	b) usual %x (int)ptr -> %p ptr fixes

    Use NET_IP_ALIGN in acenic driver. Also remove the 16 byte padding,
    caches can be anywhere from 16 to 256 bytes and the skb should be

    [AH6]: Replace skb by iph in clear_mutable_options.
    
    This patch replaces the skb argument in ipv6_clear_mutable_options() by
    an ipv6hdr.  Doing so allows us to point skb->nh elsewhere when calling
    this function.
    
    I've also thrown in some obvious clean-ups for that function.

    [AH4]: Save daddr iff options are present.
    
    This is a little optimisation for AH4.  When I moved the tunnel code out,
    I put the daddr copying code on the main path which is unnecessary since
    daddr is only mutable if IP options are present.
    
    This patch moves the saving and restoring of daddr under the check for
    the existence of IP options.

    [PATCH] ppc64: exception path optimisations
    
    - We were statically predicting syscalls would be 32bit which meant every
      64bit syscall was guaranteed to be mispredicted. Just let the hardware
      predict this one.
    
    - We shouldnt use blrl for indirect function calls, it is unlikely to be
      predicted correctly and corrupts the link prediction stack. We should
      use bctrl instead.
    
    - Statically predict a branch in the system call path, favouring calls from
      userspace.
    
    - Remove static prediction in pagefault path, hardware prediction should do
      a better job here.

    [PATCH] Fix ppc64 max_pfn issue
    
    I noticed excessive time in the pid hash functions on a ppc64 box. It
    turns out the pid hash is being sized way too small, eg on a 16GB box:
    
    PID hash table entries: 16 (order 4: 256 bytes)
    
    The reason is that the pid hash init function uses max_pfn before it was
    setup on ppc64. With the following patch things are good again:
    
    PID hash table entries: 4096 (order 12: 65536 bytes)

    [AH6]: Disallow mutable bits after AH header.
    
    As we discussed before, mutable headers should not be allowed after
    the AH header.  In fact, this appears to be the intention of RFC 2402.
    It is further clarified in section 3.1.1 of
    
    http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ipsec-rfc2402bis-07.txt
    
    This allows us to simplify the code in ah6.c.  As a result, this also
    fixes the following issues:
    
    * Dependence on skb->h in ah6_output().
    * Bogus clearing of auth_data of 2nd AH header in ipv6_clear_mutable_options().

    [PATCH] NX: allow architectures to select legacy mode dynamically
    
    On some platforms, you'll want to support READ_IMPLIES_EXEC differently
    depending on personality (e.g, native binary vs. x86 binary).
    
    This supports that (and makes the code more readable while at it) by
    replacing the old architecture-specific fixed LEGACY_BINARIES macro
    define with a architecture-specific "elf_read_implies_exec_binary()"
    helper function.
    
    For now, x86 is the only user, and sets the "read implies exec" bit for
    legacy apps.  ia64 and x86-64 are likely to want to do their own thing.

    kbuild: Less intrusive LANG override, fixes menuconfig
    
    The locale override caused problems for some people with locale setiings
    different from 'C'. make menuconfig was looking bad / unuseable.
    This patch limit the override of locales to the part where we actually descend the kernel
    doing the full build of the kernel.
    The speed improvement is the same.
    
    make menuconfig should now be useable for all locale settings again.

    [PATCH] clean up n_tty alloc_buf()
    
    Don't bother zeroing the allocated memory inside alloc_buf() in the
    n_tty line discipline.  alloc_buf() is static inline and is only
    referenced by n_tty_open() which always clears the memory (once more).
    
    No bug, just a minor cleanup

    [PKT_SCHED]: Fix pkt_cls.h incompatabilities
    
    The recent changes to (6 Jul 04) pkt_cls.h are evil, you can't build a version
    of 'tc' to work unless you know the kernel config!
    
    It has several API problems:
      - API data structures change on kernel config options
      - new fields should be added at the end of a structure to allow
        binary compatibility.
    
    This patch tries to clean this up.

    [INET]: Create enum of ECN bits
    
    This patch is a preparation for an update of the ECN encap/decap
    code with respect to RFC3168.
    
    It creates an enum of the four code-points defined by RFC3168
    and uses them throughout the inet_ecn.h file.
    
    The only non-trivial bit is in IP_ECN_set_ce/IP6_ECN_set_ce where
    the patch uses INET_ECN_CE instead of 1.  This is OK as those
    functions assume that the ECT bit is already set.

    [CRYPTO]: Fix stack overrun in crypt().
    
    The stack allocation in crypt() is bogus as whether tmp_src/tmp_dst
    is used is determined by factors unrelated to nbytes and
    src->length/dst->length.
    
    Since the condition for whether tmp_src/tmp_dst are used is very
    complex, let's allocate them always instead of guessing.
    
    This fixes a number of weird crashes including those AES crashes
    that people have been seeing with the 2.4 backport + ipt_conntrack.

    [PATCH] NX: clean up legacy binary support
    
    This cleans up legacy x86 binary support by introducing a new
    personality bit: READ_IMPLIES_EXEC, and implements Linus' suggestion to
    add the PROT_EXEC bit on the two affected syscall entry places,
    sys_mprotect() and sys_mmap().  If this bit is set then PROT_READ will
    also add the PROT_EXEC bit - as expected by legacy x86 binaries.  The
    ELF loader will automatically set this bit when it encounters a legacy
    binary.
    
    This approach avoids the problems the previous ->def_flags solution
    caused.  In particular this patch fixes the PROT_NONE problem in a
    cleaner way (http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/7/12/227), and it should fix the
    ia64 PROT_EXEC problem reported by David Mosberger.  Also,
    mprotect(PROT_READ) done by legacy binaries will do the right thing as
    well.
    
    the details:
    
    - the personality bit is added to the personality mask upon exec(),
      within the ELF loader, but is not cleared (see the exceptions below).
      This means that if an environment that already has the bit exec()s a
      new-style binary it will still get the old behavior.
    
    - one exception are setuid/setgid binaries: these will reset the
      bit - thus local attackers cannot manually set the bit and circumvent
      NX protection. Legacy setuid binaries will still get the bit through
      the ELF loader. This gives us maximum flexibility in shaping
      compatibility environments.
    
    - selinux also clears the bit when switching SIDs via exec().
    
    - x86 is the only arch making use of READ_IMPLIES_EXEC currently. Other
      arches will have the pre-NX-patch protection setup they always had.
    
    I have booted an old distro [RH 7.2] and two new PT_GNU_STACK distros
    [SuSE 9.2 and FC2] on an NX-capable CPU - they work just fine and all
    the mapping details are right. I've checked the PROT_NONE test-utility
    as well and it works as expected. I have checked various setuid
    scenarios as well involving legacy and new-style binaries.
    
    an improved setarch utility can be used to set the personality bit
    manually:
    
    	http://redhat.com/~mingo/nx-patches/setarch-1.4-3.tar.gz
    
    the new '-X' flag does it, e.g.:
    
    	./setarch -X linux /bin/cat /proc/self/maps
    
    will trigger the old protection layout even on a new distro.

    [PATCH] pmac_zilog: serial minors taken failure path fix
    
    I've tracked down the core issue giving me the oops wrt pmac_zilog.
    
    When you have two serial drivers, (e.g. 8250 and PMAC_ZILOG) they both say
    
    "I want to reserve X ports starting with major TTY_MAJOR and minor 64".
    
    By the time pmac_zilog gets there, the ports it requests are already
    reserved.  Unfortunately, init_pmz() doesn't check for pmz_register()
    failure, and so it merrily goes on to register the half-initialized
    pmac_zilog driver with the power management subsystem.
    
    This path provides a proper failure path.
    
    Also:
    
    Restore ppc configs now that I know people use AT Keyboards on CHRP and PReP
    machines, and the zilog driver is no longer Oops'ing.

    [PATCH] Fix i386 bootup with HIGHMEM+SLAB_DEBUG+NUMA and no real
    
    For some reason I booted a NUMA and SLAB_DEBUG i386 kernel on a non
    NUMA 512MB machine.  This caused an oops at bootup in change_page_attr.
    The reason was that highmem_start_start page ended up zero and
    that triggered the highmem check in change_page_attr when the
    slab debug code would unmap a kernel mapping.
    
    Fix is straightforward: if there is no highmem set highmem_start_page
    to max_low_pfn+1

    [PATCH] Fix memory corruption at x86-64 SMP bootup
    
    This fixes a long standing corruption bug in the x86-64 code. The SMP
    trampoline would corrupt page 2, which was sometimes used for other
    data.  This corrupted the ioport/iomem list in some cases and causes
    oopses while read /proc/iomem.
    
    Fix is to check the correct location and don't zero it afterwards
    because it gets reinitialized for the next CPU anyways.
    
    Thanks to Alexander Nyberg for tracking it down.

    [PATCH] fix inode state incoherency
    
    This patch fixes a hard-to-trigger condition, where the inode is on the
    inode_in_use list while it's state is dirty.  In this state dirty pages are
    not written back in sync() or from kupdate, only from direct page reclaim.
    And this causes a livelock in balance_dirty_pages after a while.

    While it's not a problem on 32bot boxen, it breaks on 64bit ones.
    
    Fixed.

    [PATCH] mmap PROT_NONE fix for NX patch
    
    This works around the current PROT_NONE problem from elf binaries that
    do not have the PT_GNU_STACK so that the do not have execute permission.
    
    The problem was that setting "def_flags" to include the VM_EXEC bit for
    compatibility reasons would also make PROT_NONE pages executable, which
    is obviously not correct.

    [PATCH] Remove all uses of '#ifdef MODULE_PARM' from kernel
    
    I got sidetracked (I do that a lot ;-) and noticed that there are only
    eight files in 2.6 that have code like:
    
    #ifdef MODULE_PARAM
    MODULE_PARAM(foo, "i");
    #endif
    
    which I think is old cruft from 2.1.x times.  Following patch removes
    all those eight (six in netfilter, one net driver and one SCSI driver).

    [PATCH] fix cdrom mt rainier probe
    
    Writing to RAM capable media was broken by the moving of write flag
    detection from probe to drive open time.  The media would stay
    terminally RO due to the set_disk_ro() call.
    
    This fixes the code to do the right thing - the detection stays at open
    time (which it must, since it depends on the media), and we fail with
    -EROFS if the media can't be written.

    Fix UART initialisation on WindRiver SBC8560.
    
    The UART tristates its IRQ output when the OUT2 bit in the MCR isn't
    set. For reasons not known to civilised man, the hardware engineers
    stopped it from floating by pulling it _high_ instead of low, so if
    anybody requests that IRQ before OUT2 is turned on, we die in an IRQ
    storm. The serial8250 driver does precisely that thing, with precisely
    that effect.
    
    ALPHA_KLUDGE_MCR was designed to fix exactly this kind of problem, so we
    use it here as intended. Ideally ALPHA_KLUDGE_MCR would go away and be
    replaced with something like UPF_FORCE_OUT2 and UPF_FORCE_OUT1 flags,
    but now is not the time to get me started on a cleanup of everything
    about serial8250 that offends me.

    in pre_task_mulout_intr() only makes sense if we can't trust STATUS register
    (because we call ide_wait_stat() which reads STATUS register earlier).
    
    Remove this "workaround" for now as it is not present in ide-disk.c
    and whole multi PIO-out code (CONFIG_IDE_TASKFILE_IO=n) was buggy before.

    [PATCH] ide: PIO-out error handling fixes (CONFIG_IDE_TASKFILE_IO=y)
    
    We shouldn't ever get into ->handler() if drive is busy so
    just call ->error() unconditionally if status check fails.

    Setup handler and output first data block directly from ->prehandler()
    instead of calling ->handler().  The only change in functionality is that
    we no longer check DRIVE_READY status bits (there is no need to do it).

    [PATCH] add removeable sysfs block device attribute
    
    This patch adds a /block/*/removeable sysfs attribute. A value of 1
    indicates the media can change anytime. This is a hint for userland
    to poll such devices for possible media changes, and leave all others alone.
    There is currently no way to see if a connected usb-storage device is a
    disk or a card reader. It will also show 1 for CD and ZIP drives.
    
    It was done by Patrick Mansfield a while ago. I can probably not
    sigh-off his work. ;)

    [PATCH] Upgrade security/root_plug.c to new module parameter syntax
    
    Hi again,
    
    Still doing my compile, and got this:
    
     CC [M]  security/root_plug.o
    security/root_plug.c:39: warning: missing initializer
    security/root_plug.c:39: warning: (near initialization for `__parm_vendor_id.addr')

    security/root_plug.c:48: warning: missing initializer
    security/root_plug.c:48: warning: (near initialization for `__parm_debug.addr')
    
    Simply upgrading root_plug to use the new module parameter syntax seemed to do
    the trick. I made the debug writable, the others just readable to root.

    Unfortunatley, we had to little information to fix the problem described

    This patch marks w9968cf_valid_depth as inline, although it's used
    before it's defined.
    
    gcc 3.4 therefore correctly fails with:
    
    <--  snip  -->
    
    ...
      CC      drivers/usb/media/w9968cf.o

    This patch moves w9968cf_valid_depth above it's first user (it also uses
    two other functions to keep the ordering of functions a bit more
    consistent).

    At least one OTG root hub won't reliably (<10%) report device speed until

    [PATCH] USB: usb host side updates, mostly for suspend
    
    This adds some of the infrastructure needed to support some more
    USB capabilities:
    
     -  CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND, so Linux can put individual devices
        into the USB "suspend" state.  They can (sometimes) use
        "remote wakeup" to resume the host; or they can each be
        resumed by the host.
    
          + New usbcore device selective suspend/resume APIs
    	* Define them, as stubs for now
    	* Call them on the paths sysfs uses (renamed functions)
          + HCD support
    	* Define root hub suspend calls; delegate them to HCDs.
    	* OHCI and EHCI can suspend/resume root hubs that way.
    	* Not called yet, until suspend/resume calls exist
    
     -  CONFIG_USB_OTG, which depends on the selective suspend APIs
        to allow devices to switch roles (host to peripheral, etc).
        This patch just adds a few key flags in usb_bus, needed by
        usbcore (during enumeration) and by HCD and OTG controllers
        on OTG-capable boards.
    
     -  Related bugfix:  power budgeting is supposed to place a
        100mA per port (non-OTG) for bus-powered devices.
    
    This patch changes no behavior; later patches will do that,
    and they'll be smaller because of this.

    [PATCH] USB: ftdi_sio VID/PID updates
    
    Greg,
    
    This patch adds various VID/PIDs to the ftdi_sio driver that I've
    accumulated from the ftdi-usb-sio-devel mailing list, and one from
    the 2.4 kernel sources:
    
    * Interbiometrics USB I/O boards VID/PIDs from 2.4 kernel (Rudolf
      Gugler).
    * Intrepid Control Systems ValueCAN and NeoVI VID/PIDs from Scott
      Wolchok.
    * Falcom Twist USB GPRS modem VID/PID from Justin Schoeman.
    * Suunto Sports instrument PID from Panu Kekalainen.
    
    Also a few minor clean-ups:
    
    * Removed a stray PID macro constant FTDI_GUDEADS_889_PID.
    * Copied the Inside Accesso VID/PID into the FT232BM ID table so
      that the "combined" table is a proper union of the others (unless I've
      missed something else).
    * Added a comment that the OCT US101 is also rebadged as a SIIG Inc.
      US2308.

    [PATCH] Updates for W99[87]CF and new SN9C10[12] driver
    
    This single patch contains some updates and cleanups for
    the W996[87]CF driver and a new experimental V4L2 driver
    for SONiX SN9C10[12] PC Camera Controllers connected to various
    image sensors. I have not divided the patch in two logical
    sub-patches becouse of two independent changes in one common
    file, KConfigure.
    
    More informations about the SN9C10[12] can be found below in the
    documentation. The driver is marked as "EXPERIMENTAL", meaning
    that there are no known bugs, but further testing is necessary
    before considering it stable. This the first driver using the new
    SBGGR8 video format, which has been recently added to the mainline
    kernel, so there are no available user application at the moment:
    this is one more reason why it should be in the kernel now.
    
    Changes in W996[87]CF:
    - remove w9968cf_externaldef.h now that ovcamchip.h is in the kernel;
    - mark user pointers with __user in a cleaner way to avoid sparse
      warnings;
    - use appropriate exclusive wait macro during open();
    - replace info(), err(), warn() with dev_info(), dev_err(), dev_warn(),
      pr_debug(), pr_info();
    - replace usb_unlink_urb() + wait_for_completion() with usb_kill_urb();
    - fix memory offsets for buffers in the chip to be used with generic
      image sensors;
    - 'vppmod_load', 'debug', 'specific_debug' and 'simcams' module
      parameters are now writeable by default;
    - fix possible race conditions between disconnect() and open();
    - add automatic 'ovcamchip' module loading option with 'ovmod_load'
      module parameter;
    - get rid of deprecated intermodule communication routines and use the
      correct module registration/unregistration approach;
    - remove period at the end of kernel messages;
    - fix several typos;
    - use MODULE_VERSION() macro;
    - other small internal cleanups;
    - documentation updates.

    [PATCH] USB: usb ethernet gadget, minor fixes + basic OTG support
    
    Update CDC Ethernet/RNDIS gadget driver to the latest:
    
        -	Basics of OTG support: providing the OTG descriptor
    	in each configuration (as needed).   No HNP yet.
    
        -	Stop issuing partial-packet reads.  There's some hardware that
    	only counts reads in packets, not bytes, so let's not bother.
    	There are still software checks to catch framing gone wild.
    
        -	Fix a small bug that crept in with a memory leak fix: after
            RNDIS requests, ep0 responses would use the RNDIS completion
    	handler even for non-RNDIS requests.

    [PATCH] USB: usb gadget zero, basic OTG updates
    
    This patch teaches "gadget zero" enough about OTG to pass simple USBCV
    tests, mostly by including OTG descriptors in each configuration.  It
    tests and reports OTG status, as reported by the USB controller driver.
    
    It also adds an option to build gadget zero to act as the designated
    OTG "HNP Test Device", which exists primarily to trigger HNP.  However,
    it won't currently request HNP.
    
    Includes other minor tweaks:  delete a timer on disconnect, reset
    the req->zero flag, don't autoresume after disconnect.

    [PATCH] USB: usb gadget API updates
    
    Gadget API updates, including new features:
    
        -	Adds several new optional calls that can be made to the
    	USB peripheral controller:
    
    	    * VBUS session reporting, for use mostly by external
    	      transcievers (such as isp1301).  Detection of VBUS
    	      power is the first step in enumeration, and usually
    	      corresponds to a device being plugged into a hub.
    
    	    * "Soft Connect" feature, wherein the D+ pullup is under
    	      gadget driver control.  This is a second step during
    	      enumeration, which lets the hub see the new device.
    	      (Based on a patch by Alex Sanks <alex@netchip.com>.)
    
    	    * Control over VBUS current draw.  So for example this is
    	      what a gadget driver uses during SET_CONFIGURATION to
    	      say "it's OK to draw 300 mA from VBUS to recharge".
    
        -	Basic interfaces to support device-side USB OTG.  Feature
    	flags and descriptors are in <linux/usb_ch9.h> already.
    
    	    * Reports whether the device has a Mini-AB port, so
    	      that OTG support (desriptors etc) is required.
    
    	    * Reports OTG device feature flags for HNP.  (The OTG
    	      spec requires user interfaces to report this stuff.)
    	      Say if this is a B-Peripheral or an A-Peripheral.
    
    	    * Says that usb_gadget_wakeup() is how to access SRP,
    	      and usb_gadget_disconnect() is how to access HNP.
    
        -	Minor updates/cleanups to comments (Linux 2.5-->2.6 etc)
    
    Currently there's no support for SRP-only OTG devices.

Author: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>

    [PATCH] tg3 bug
    
    During receive processing, the tg3 card updates rx_producer (the
    hardware position in the receive ring) and the opaque cookie. Due to PCI
    rules the stores happen in order. However the cpu may reorder the reads.
    
    In these sort of cases there is usually a data dependency between
    reading the index and looking up the data (since we use the index to
    load the data). I think all cpus except alpha guarantee the reads
    happen in order in this case.
    
    However in this particular case we load hw_idx, compare it to sw_idx and
    then use sw_idx to locate the opaque cookie. There is no data dependency
    in this case. We need a read memory barrier between the read of
    rx_producer and the opaque cookie to enforce ordering.
    
    Thanks to Olof Johansson, Michael Chan and Broadcom for their assistance
    in finding this bug.

    [PATCH] fix airo oops-on-removal
    
    From: Bill Nottingham <notting@redhat.com>
    
    airo creates /proc/driver/aironet/<device name> on device activation.
    However, the device can be renamed - then on teardown it tries to remove
    the wrong directory.  The removal of /proc/driver/aironet then runs afoul
    of the BUG_ON() in remove_proc_entry.
    
    This fixes it by keeping a copy of the name of the directory it created.
    
    (It doesn't actually solve the problem of the stats directory still being
    /proc/driver/aironet/eth0 when you rename the device to, say, 'joe'.  But
    that patch would be a little less trivial.)

    [PATCH] USB: fix usbfs mount options ignored bug
    
    Ok here is a patch to make the mount options work.  In addition to
    implementing the remount function, it removes the parse_options() call
    from usb_fill_super and adds a "ignore" flag around the mounting that gets
    done in create_special_files.  The parse_options call in usb_fill_super is
    removed because it is not needed when remount is implemented.  The
    ignore_mount flag is needed because the simple_pin_fs function calls
    remount with no mount options - i.e. it's not a real mount.  So the mount
    options would be cleared out.  The ignore_mount flag causes the remount
    function to only act on real mounts.

    present since 2.6.6 and only got tracked down just now!  Thanks a lot to
    Michel Roelofs for all his help and testing.
    
    This should be pushed through to Linus in time to appear in 2.6.8, if
    possible.

    Hi Greg!
    
    I am compiling allmodconfig with some extra gcc warnings enabled

    In file included from security/root_plug.c:30:

    [PATCH] USB: fix lockup with 2.6 keyspan_pda driver

    Did that driver ever work with 2.6?

    [PATCH] USB: Remove hub's children upon unbinding
    
    This patch fixes a logical hole in the hub driver.  It's possible for the
    driver to be unbound from a hub without physically unplugging the hub.
    For example, writing 0 into the bConfigurationValue attribute file will
    have this effect.  When this happens, we need to make sure that all the
    child devices of the hub are logically disconnected and their ports
    disabled.
    
    That's what this patch does.  It's a little bit tricky because we can't
    simply call usb_disconnect() from within the hub driver's disconnect()
    routine.  While that routine is running it holds the usb bus writelock,
    but usb_disconnect() would try to acquire it again.  Instead
    schedule_work() is used, so after a brief delay the children will be
    removed.

    [PATCH] USB: Store pointer to usb_device in private hub structure
    
    This patch adds a pointer to the hub's usb_device into the usb_hub private
    structure.  It's a small change, and permits a small amount of
    simplification in a few spots, i.e., avoid calling interface_to_usbdev().
    This doesn't really do much in itself, but it's a prerequisite for the
    next patch.  (A situation arises where we can't use the interface pointer
    to find the usb_device because the interface might not exist.)

    [PATCH] USB: Don't ask for string descriptor lengths
    
    Okay, here's a revised patch (as332b).  This tries first to ask for 255
    bytes, and if that fails then it asks for the length and the full
    descriptor.  Hopefully nobody will object to applying this version...
    
    You know, it occurs to me that the have_langid field in usb_device could
    easily be eliminated.  Just set string_langid to -1 during initialization
    and test for whether or not it is >= 0.  I'll do that some other time.

    [PATCH] USB: Add usb_kill_urb()
    
    This patch is a slightly revised version of as277c, updated to match the
    current source.  The only difference from the older version is that this
    makes urb->use_count into an atomic_t, to avoid the overhead of an extra
    locking step each time an URB is submitted and given back.  The important
    features of this patch are:
    
    	-EPERM added to Documentation/usb/error-codes.txt.
    
    	Failure to use URB_ASYNC_UNLINK with usb_unlink_urb() is
    	deprecated in the documentation.
    
    	New ->reject and ->use_count fields added to struct urb.
    	The reject field is protected by urb->lock, and locking is
    	required only in usb_kill_urb() which doesn't have to be fast.
    
    	Single wait_queue used for all processes waiting inside
    	usb_kill_urb().  The wait queue is woken up only when an URB
    	is given back with ->reject set.
    
    	usb_rh_status_dequeue() changed to return int.  It looks like
    	this function should be declared static; it's not used outside
    	the hcd.c file.
    
    	Prototype for unlink_urb() in struct usb_operations is changed
    	to include a status code argument.  This is necessary so that
    	the different unlink paths can return -ENOENT and -ECONNRESET
    	as appropriate.
    
    	Support for synchronous usb_unlink_urb() has been removed;
    	such calls are passed to usb_kill_urb().
    
    	Kerneldoc for usb_unlink_urb() is updated.
    
    	usb_kill_urb() added to urb.c.
    
    	hc_simple() host driver is partially updated -- it should
    	compile but it won't really work right.

    [PATCH] mcdx irq handling cleanup
    
    mcdx has different IRQ numbers for all drives; irq handler needs a

    of passing such pointer at request_irq() time and having it passed to

    array indexed by IRQ number and has mcdx_intr() go look it up there.
    
    Cleaned up, array killed.

    [PATCH] sparse: read_descriptor_t annotation
    
    We have a fun situation with read_descriptor_t - all its instances end
    up passed to some actor; these actors use desc->buf as their private
    data; there are 5 of them and they expect resp:
    
            struct lo_read_data *
            struct svc_rqst *
            struct file *
            struct rpc_xprt *
            char __user *
    
    IOW, there is no type safety whatsoever; the field is essentially untyped,
    we rely on the fact that actor is chosen by the same code that sets ->buf
    and expect it to put something of the right type there.
    
    Right now desc->buf is declared as char __user *.  Moreover, the last
    argument of ->sendfile() (what should be stored in ->buf) is void __user *,
    even though it's actually _never_ a userland pointer.
    
    If nothing else, ->sendfile() should take void * instead; that alone removes
    a bunch of bogus warnings.  I went further and replaced desc->buf with a
    union of void * and char __user *.

    [PATCH] compat_fillonedir() warning fix
    
    	access_ok() expects a pointer, not unsigned long.  It's not a
    problem on platforms that have this guy done as a macro (or ones that
    do not use fs/compat.c at all), but that's still wrong and on some
    platforms that care we actually have access_ok() as inlined function.
    Bogus cast removed.

    	c) vfc does dereferencing of userland pointer, right after having
    carefully copied the data to kernel space ;-)  Fixed.
    	d) vfc ->mmap() had missed prototype change.  Fixed.
    	e) BPP ioctls are misdeclared - they should've been _IO(...) instead
    of _IOR(..., void).  Too late to fix, but we can at least make them
    _IOR(..., char) - same value, but doesn't try to find sizeof(void).

    [PATCH] sparse: tms380tr.c fix
    
    	tms380tr is used both by ISA and PCI drivers.  Enabling/disabling
    DMA is done only for ISA ones (it's protected by if (dev->dma > 0) and
    PCI ones leave it 0), but it's compiled unconditionally.  Which breaks
    on platforms that don't have that ISA crap at all, but support PCI just
    fine.  Code in question placed under ifdef CONFIG_ISA.

    To avoid multiple dentries for these names, jfs needs to provide

    only used when the volume was created in OS/2 or with the -O flag.

    copy_from_user() moved from dvb_ringbuffer_{write,pkt_write}() to callers;
    these functions are always getting kernel pointer now.  "usermem" argument
    killed, code annotated.

    x86: fix stackframe ownership confusion in sys_sigaltstack()
    
    gcc doesn't understand that "asmlinkage" routines have the
    argument stack owned by the assembly-language caller, and the
    recent sparse cleanup made gcc think it owns enough stack
    frame space to make a tailcall by overwriting "struct pt_regs"
    that is set up by the low-level system call code.
    
    Hide that problem again.
    
    The real fix would be to tell gcc that the caller owns the
    stack frame that it set up, but we don't have any such
    interfaces, so for now the best we can do is to hide it.

    explicitly timestamp the packets before we log them.

    [PATCH] mpage_writepages() i_size reading fix
    
    I believe reading the i_size from memory multiple times can generate fs
    corruption.  The "offset" and the "end_index" were not coherent.  this is
    writepages and it runs w/o the i_sem, so the i_size can change from under
    us anytime.  If a parallel write happens while writepages run, the i_size
    could advance from 4095 to 4100.  With the current 2.6 code that could
    translate in end_index = 0 and offset = 4.  That's broken because end_index
    and offset could be not coherent.  Either end_index=1 and offset =4, or
    end_index = 0 and offset = 4095.  When they lose coherency the memset can
    zeroout actual data.  The below patch fixes that (it's at least a
    theoretical bug).
    
    I don't really expect this tiny race to fix the bug in practice after the
    more serious bugs we covered yesterday didn't fix it (more likely the
    compiler will get involved into the equation soon ;).
    
    This is also an optimization for 32bit archs that needs special locking to
    read 64bit i_size coherenty.
    
    This patch also arranges for mpage_writepages() to always zero out the file's
    final page between i_size and the end of the file's final block.  This is a
    best-effort correctness thing to deal with errant applications which write
    into the mmapped page beyond the underlying file's EOF.

    [PATCH] writepage fs corruption fix
    
    Fix a data loss bug in mpage_writepages(), triggerable under extreme memory
    pressure on ext2, JFS, hfs and hfsplus:
    
    The bug is the marking of the bh clean despite we could still run into the
    "confused" path.  After that the confused path really becomes confused and it
    writes nothing and fs corruption triggers silenty (the reugular writepage only
    writes bh that are marked dirty, it never attempts to submit_bh anything
    marked clean).  The mpage-writepage code must never mark the bh clean as far
    as it wants to still fallback in the regular writepage which depends on the bh
    to be dirty (i.e.  the "goto confused" path).  This could only triggers with
    memory pressure (it also needs buffer_heads_over_limit == 0, and that is
    frequent under mm pressure).
    
    Thanks a lot to Chris for his fine debugging that localized the problem in the
    writepage code.

    derived from akpm's patch scripts.  Excluding the .pc directory is handy,
    because otherwise old versions of files found in there tend to end up at the

    [PATCH] trivial: scripts_kernel-doc: ignoring embedded structs shouldn't be
    
    From:  <adobriyan@mail.ru>
    
    Imagine you have a code similar to
    
      struct foo {
      	union {
      		struct tcphdr   *th;
      	} h;
      	union {
      		struct iphdr    *iph;
      	} nh;
      };
    
    kernel-doc in it's current state will happily eat everything from first '{' to
    last '}' and nobody will see parameter 'h' in documentation (look at
    include/linux/skbuff.h:struct sk_buff for real world example).
    
    So, fix the greedy regexp.

    The first one is pretty dangerous looking, as smb_proc_readdir_long() can
    return several negative error values and all those are converted to
    unsigned and then erronously pass the test on line 2313.  Chris Wright gave
    it a quick look and we did not see immediately if this can be remotely
    exploited, but it looks pretty scary.

    [PATCH] Use llseek instead of f_pos= for directory seeking
    
    nfsd currently just sets f_pos when seeking in a directory.  This bypasses
    any checking and other handling that a filesystem might want to do.
    
    So instead, we define "vfs_llseek" to be an exported "llseek", and use
    that, both to seek at the start, and the find the new position at the end.

    [PATCH] kAFS automount support
    
    Here's a patch to allow the kAFS filesystem to use the automount facility
    patch presented in a previous email.
    
    It allows me to mount an AFS root volume on /afs and then just walk through
    the directory structure causing referenced volumes to be automounted and
    autoumounted.
    
    For instance, if I do:
    
    	[root@andromeda root]# mount -t afs \#root.afs. /afs
    	[root@andromeda root]# ls /afs
    	asd  cambridge  cambridge.redhat.com  grand.central.org
    	[root@andromeda root]# ls /afs/cambridge
    	afsdoc
    	[root@andromeda root]# ls /afs/cambridge/afsdoc/
    	ChangeLog  html  LICENSE  pdf  RELNOTES-1.2.2
    
    And then look in the mountpoint catalogue, I see:
    
    	[root@andromeda root]# cat /proc/mounts
    	...
    	#root.afs. /afs afs rw 0 0
    	#root.cell. /afs/cambridge.redhat.com afs rw 0 0
    	#afsdoc. /afs/cambridge.redhat.com/afsdoc afs rw 0 0
    
    Then after waiting a few minutes:
    
    	[root@andromeda root]# cat /proc/mounts
    	...
    	#root.afs. /afs afs rw 0 0
    
    Is all that remains.

    [PATCH] intrinsic automount and mountpoint degradation support
    
    Here's a patch that I worked out with Al Viro that adds support for a
    filesystem (such as kAFS) to perform automounting intrinsically without the
    need for a userspace daemon.  It also adds support for such mountpoints to be
    degraded at the filesystem's behest until they've been untouched long enough
    that they'll be removed.
    
    I've a patch (to follow) that removes some #ifdef's from fs/afs/* thus
    allowing it to make use of this facility.
    
    There are five pieces to this:
    
     (1) Any interested filesystem needs to have at least one list to which
         expirable mountpoints can be added.
    
         Access to this list is governed by the vfsmount_lock.
    
     (2) When a filesystem wants to create an expirable mount, it calls
         do_kern_mount() to get a handle on the filesystem it wants mounting, and
         then calls do_add_mount() to mount that filesystem on the designated
         mountpoint, supplying the list mentioned in (1) to which the vfsmount
         will be added.
    
         In kAFS's case, the mountpoint is a directory with a follow_link() method
         defined (fs/afs/mntpt.c). This uses the struct nameidata supplied as an
         argument as a determination of where the new filesystem should be
         mounted.
    
     (3) When something using a vfsmount finishes dealing with it, it calls
         mntput(). This unmarks the vfsmount for immediate expiry.
    
         There are two criteria for determining if a vfsmount may be expired - it
         mustn't be marked as in use for anything other than being a child of
         another vfsmount, and it must have an expiry mark against it already.
    
     (4) The filesystem then determines the policy on expiring the mounts created
         in (2). When it feels the need to, it passes the list mentioned in (1) to
         mark_mounts_for_expiry() to request everything on the list be expired.
    
         This function examines each mount listed. If the vfsmount meets the
         criteria mentioned in (3), then the vfsmount is deleted from the
         namespace and disposed of as for unmounting; otherwise the vfsmount is
         left untouched apart from now bearing an expiration mark if it didn't
         before.
    
         kAFS's expiration policy is simply to invoke this process at regular
         intervals for all the mounts on its list.
    
     (5) An expiration facility is also provided to userspace: by calling umount()
         with a MNT_EXPIRE flag, it can make a request to unmount only if the
         mountpoint hasn't been used since the last request and isn't in use now.
    
         This allows expiration to be driven by userspace instead of by the
         kernel if that is desirable.
    
         This also means that do_umount() has to use a different version of
         path_release() to everyone else... it can't call mntput() as that clears
         the expiration flag, thus rendering this unachievable; so it's version of
         path_release() calls _mntput(), which doesn't do the clear.
    
    My original idea was to give the kernel more knowledge of automounted
    things. This avoids a certain problem with stat() on a mountpoint causing it
    to mount (for example, do "ls -l /afs" on a machine with kAFS), but Al wanted
    it done this way.
    
    > Why is autofs unsuitable?
    
    Because:
    
     (1) Autofs is flat; AFS requires a tree - mounts on mounts on mounts on
         mounts...
    
     (2) AFS holds the data as to what the mountpoints are and where they go, and
         these may be cross-links to subtrees beyond your control. It's also not
         trivial to extract a list of mountpoints as is required for autofs.
    
     (3) Autofs is not namespace safe.
    
     (4) Ducking back to userspace to get that to do the mount is pretty tricky if
         namespaces are involved.
    
    In fact, autofs may well want to make use of this facility.

    From: Will Schmidt <willschm@us.ibm.com>
    
    This patch includes updates and cleanup for the PPC64 proc/lparcfg interface.
         - use seq_file's seq_printf for output
         - remove redundant e2a function. (use viopath.c's instead)
         - change to Kconfig to allow building as a module.
         - export required symbols from LparData.c
    
        Pass # 2 updates..
          - Per Pauls request I've removed the vpurr references, and left
    	just a stub function get_purr().
          - this should apply clean to latest linus tree.  (test-applied against
    	2.6.7-rc3).
    
        Pass # 3 updates...
          - Correcting my previously incorrect description of the
    	lparcfg_count_active_processors() function..
    	This is for the cases where we have some number of virtual
    	processors that are different than the total number of threads
    	in the system.  (i.e. systemcfg->processorcount isnt the desired
    	value for partition_active_processors)
          - moved e2a function into its own file in arch/ppc64/lib.
          - changed lparcfg_count_active_processors() to use a while loop
    	instead of a for loop.
          - removed redundant of_node_put in lparcfg_count_active_processors().
          - removed unneeded parms from get-system-parameter rtas_call.

    [IPSEC]: Move generic encap code into xfrm4_output
    
    I've finally finished merging the general encapsulation code for IPv4.
    Here is the patch.
    
    The idea is basically to make x->type->output similar in structure to
    x->type->input.  That means moving the tunnel encapsulation and other
    generic code out.
    
    They have ended up in xfrm4_output.c.
    
    The advantage of this is that we have exactly one copy of the tunnel
    encapsulation code.  So if we need to change it (e.g., set the TTL
    according to the route) then it's easier and less error-prone.
    
    In fact, in doing so I've already noticed that the ECN wasn't being
    copied correctly in everything except xfrm4_tunnel.

    [Bluetooth] Respond to L2CAP info requests
    
    This patch adds the correct behavior when a L2CAP info request is sent
    by the peer. The answer should be a L2CAP info response with the result
    code set to "not supported".

    ia64: Fix EFI physical-mode stubs to correctly calculate physical address
    
    This fixes a bug in which the Ski simulator ended up getting the wrong
    time, since phys_get_time() ended up storing the correct time in the
    wrong place if a region-5 virtual address was passed (as would happen
    for stack variables of the init-task).  On real machines, this bug
    likely would have caused a crash on machines which don't support
    switching EFI into virtual mode.

    [PATCH] ia64: fix interpolation-bug in fsys_gettimeofday()
    
    The order of reading ar.itc is incorrect with respect to all other
    variables in fsys_gettimeofday.  All variables involved in time
    interpolation need to be protected by the sequence lock xtime_lock for
    consistency check.  However, the first time that fsys_gettimeofday()
    takes a time stamp, it reads the count outside the seq lock leading to
    the following possible time leap into the future scenario:
    
    fsys_gettimeofday:
      read ar.itc
    
      .... <context switch> ....
    
      read_seqbegin
        read all other variables (last_nsec_offset, jiffies, xtime)
        do time interpolation - elapsed_cycles become a large negative
           number and converting it to nsec overflows and make it a
           large positive number
      read_seqretry success
      updates last_nsec_offset (which is several seconds into the future).
    
    All subsequent gettimeofday() calls will be wrong as well because
    monotonic property kicks in.  It only self-corrects once that future
    time actually arrives.
    
    This patch fixes the problem (and moves one instruction to make some room).

    Back out smc91x late collision "performance" hack.
    
    Apparantly, the reason for this change is that it gives "much less
    NFS stalls with a SMC91C96 on a 10/100MB switch."
    
    Alan Cox's comments on this is:
    "spec says 16 collision retries max _ever_.  I bet his 'broken
    switch' is a case of half v full duplex" and a recommendation to
    remove it.
    
    Also, since the change does not limit the number of times we may
    retry to send the packet, I think this code opens a potential DoS
    attack against network which has a machine connected running this
    code.

    [IPV4]: Fix multicast socket hangs.
    
    If a multicast packet gets looped back, the sending
    socket can hang if a local read just sits and does
    not empty its receive queue.
    
    The problem is that when an SKB clone is freed up,
    the destructor is only invoked for the head SKB when
    there is a fraglist (which is created for fragmentation).
    
    The solution is to account the fragment list SKB lengths
    in the top-level head SKB, then it all works out.

    [PATCH] I2C: Add support for LM86, MAX6657 and MAX6658 to lm90
    
    This adds support for the LM86, MAX6657 and MAX6658 sensor chips to the
    lm90 driver. These are less popular than the LM90 and ADM1032 but
    several users have reported to use these, so I added support to the lm90
    driver. All these chips are fully compatible so that's just a matter of
    accepting the new chip ids. I also slightly simplified the detection
    code.

    [PATCH] ia64: Fix OSDL BugMe report 2885: realtime process can't preempt low priority process in kernel
    
    Rearranged code to make it work. There were two problems:
    
     1. The preempt flag was being tested only if code was leaving for
        user space (the logic should be: test for RESCHEDULE if we're
        switching to a kernel thread, test everything if switching to a
        user thread)
    
     2. The check of the user space flags was being repeated even if the
        work had been done.
    
    There is one small change in semantics: when returning from a
    preemption, the preemption flag will *not* be rechecked.  Otherwise, I
    found that it was easy to get into a livelock situation where no
    forward progress was made.

      should use seq_release_private().
    
    - ipmr_mfc_seq_xxx is using it->cache, in order to control whether

      ipmr_mfc_seq_start(). So it can point the previous state if user

    Add two further attributes, "card_insert" and "card_eject". Reading
    these files will fail; but writing _anything_ non-empty to these
    files will execute an user insert/ejection request -- equivalent
    to "cardctl insert", "cardctl eject".
    
    To ensure proper error values to userspace, transform the return
    values from CS_ error codes to -E error codes.

    [PCMCIA] core socket sysfs support, export card type
    
    Patch from Dominik Brodowski
    
    Add a first socket-related sysfs entry; and to keep things ordered,
    do so in a new file drivers/pcmcia/socket_sysfs.c. To keep things
    easy, all files will be present all the time, even if no card is in
    the socket at a specific moment -- however, accessing the file will
    result in -ENODEV then, so that
    
    # cat /sys/class/pcmcia_socket/pcmcia_socket1/card_type
    
    will cause an error message like
    
    "cat: card_type: No such device"
    
    which is quite self-explanatory.
    
    
    The attribute "card_type" will return either "16-bit" or "32-bit",
    depending on whether the PCCard is a 16-bit PCMCIA card or a 32-bit
    CardBus card. The result "invalid" should not happen, and if it
    happens, something strange is going on.

    [PATCH] fbcon: new scrolling mode: YPAN + REDRAW
    
    Added a new scrolling mode (SCROLL_PAN_REDRAW) to fbcon that should greatly
    benefit unaccelerated drivers such as VESA fbdev.  An increase of 3-10 times
    in scrolling speed can be expected.
    
    Currently, fbcon has 4 different scrolling methods (1-4).  Potentially, we can
    have 6.  This patch implements SCROLL_PAN_REDRAW (5).  SCROLL_WRAP_REDRAW (6)
    is still unimplemented.
    
    Scroll Mode		Operation	YPan	YWrap
    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    1. SCROLL_ACCEL		copyarea	No	No
    2. SCROLL_REDRAW	imageblit	No	No
    3. SCROLL_PAN		copyarea	Yes	No
    4. SCROLL_WRAP		copyarea	No	Yes
    5. SCROLL_PAN_REDRAW 	imageblit	Yes	No
    6. SCROLL_WRAP_REDRAW	imageblit	No	Yes
    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    Note 1:  I've changed the nomenclature to increase clarity:
    
    SCROLL_ACCEL = SCROLL_MOVE
    SCROLL_REDRAW = SCROLL_REDRAW
    SCROLL_PAN = SCROLL_PAN_MOVE
    SCROLL_WRAP = SCROLL_WRAP_MOVE
    
    To demonstrate the effect of each of the scrolling methods on
    an unaccelerated PCI/AGP-based driver (vesafb), I used a simple
    benchmark (time cat linux/MAINTAINERS - a 50K text file). The
    framebuffer is set at:
    
    1024x768-8bpp, 8x16 font, yres_virtual = 2*yres
    
    1. SCROLL_MOVE:
    real    5m50.277s
    user    0m0.001s
    sys     5m50.227s
    
    Almost 6 minutes for a 50K text file.  Using soft copyarea on a
    PCI-based card is just too slow (because copyarea has to
    read from the framebuffer memory).
    
    2. SCROLL_PAN_MOVE
    scrollmode: SCROLL_PAN
    real    0m8.592s
    user    0m0.000s
    sys     0m8.586s
    
    Using ypan with copyarea dramatically improves the scrolling.  However, the
    scrolling action is jerky (fast during the panning stages, slows down during
    the copyarea stages).
    
    3. SCROLL_REDRAW (this is the default scrolling mode)
    real    0m3.189s
    user    0m0.000s
    sys     0m3.170s
    
    Simply eliminating the copyarea, even without ypanning, makes it faster than
    SCROLL_PAN_MOvE.  Plus, the scrolling action is smoother.
    
    So, if we combine YPanning with imageblit (PAN_REDRAW), we get this:
    
    4. SCROLL_PAN_REDRAW
    real    0m0.520s
    user    0m0.000s
    sys     0m0.518s
    
    That's almost 6x faster than SCROLL_REDRAW.  Increasing the amount of video
    RAM still increases the speed, but not very dramatically.  Higher than 16 MB,
    the increase is negligible.
    
    Using an accelerated driver, we see almost the same effect but not as
    dramatically:
    
    1. SCROLL_MOVE - accel
    real    0m3.112s
    user    0m0.000s
    sys     0m3.112s
    
    2. SCROLL_REDRAW - accel
    real    0m2.604s
    user    0m0.000s
    sys     0m2.603s
    
    Redraw is still faster than move, but not much.
    
    3. SCROLL_PAN_MOVE - accel
    real    0m0.203s
    user    0m0.000s
    sys     0m0.202s
    
    4. SCROLL_PAN_REDRAW - accel
    real    0m0.326s
    user    0m0.002s
    sys     0m0.323s
    
    This is one exception.  If panning is enabled, move is actually faster than
    redraw.  As to why, I don't know.
    
    So based on the above, fbcon will choose the scrolling method based on the
    following preference:
    
    Ypan/Ywrap > accel imageblit > accel copyarea >
    soft imageblit > (soft copyarea)
    
    Note 2: Exception: accel copyarea > accel imageblit if Pan/Wrap is enabled.
    
    Note 3: soft copyarea will be avoided by fbcon as much as possible unless
    there is a specific override, ie., FBINFO_READS_FAST flag is set.  If this
    flag is set, fbcon will prefer copyarea over imageblit, accel or soft.
    
    As a final note, in order for fbcon to use the best scrolling method, the
    low-level drivers must provide the correct hinting by setting the
    FBINFO_HWACCEL_* flags.
    
    To vesafb users: boot vesafb like this for fastest scrolling action:
    
    video=vesafb:ypan,vram:16

    [PATCH] fbcon: refinements for fbcon
    
    1.  From Petr Vandrovec <vandrove@vc.cvut.cz>.
    
    Begin quote
    
            yesterday I finally found why 2.6.x has problems with taking
            over vgacon.  Problem is that take_over_console does:
    
      	if (IS_VISIBLE)
        	save_screen(i);
      	...
      	visual_init(i, 0);
      	...
    
            so code nicely saves screen contents, and calls visual_init,
            which calls fbcon's init, which in turn can issue vc_resize.  And this
            vc_resize will trigger read from vc->vc_origin.  But vc_origin still
            points to videomemory, not to the buffer where save_screen() copied
            its data.
    
    End quote
    
    So updating vc->vc_origin to point to screenbuf after the previous console
    deinitializes allows fbcon to correctly update the screen from the screen
    buffer.  This change makes the clearing of vram (using fillrect) unnecessary.
    
    2.  If FBINFO_MISC_MODESWITCH flag is set in info, do the set_par() in
    fbcon_switch() instead of piggy-backing the set_par() on fbcon_resize().  This
    preserves the current var, skipping the unnecessary fb_find_mode() step.

    [PATCH] fbcon mode switching fix
    
    Ugly workaround.  When switching from KD_GRAPHICS to KD_TEXT, the event is
    captured at fbcon_blank() allowing fbcon to reinitialize the hardware.
    However, some hardware requires the reinitialization to be done
    immediately, others require it to be done later.  Others may need it to be
    done immediately and later, this is the worst case.

    [PATCH] s390: cpu-idle notifier
    
    This patch introduces a notifier chain for cpu idle.  There are two events
    CPU_IDLE and CPU_NOT_IDLE that are called just before the cpu goes to sleep
    and right after the cpu woke up again.  The notifier is used to simplify the
    no-hz-timer-in-idle feature and the virtual cpu timers.  In addition the
    virtual cpu timer functions have been moved to arch/s390/kernel/vtime.c, which
    gives a nice separation between the timer functions related to real time and
    the timer functions related to virtual cpu time.

    [IPCOMP]: Exclude IPCOMP header from props.header_len
    
    This is another patch on the way towards a unified XFRM tunnel
    encapsulation function.
    
    This patch changes the value of props.header_len for IPCOMP to
    exclude the IPCOMP header.  The reason is that the IPCOMP header
    is added only if the packet is compressible.  That is, if the
    size of the compressed payload plus the size of the IPCOMP header
    is less than that of the original payload.
    
    This means that the IPCOMP encapsulation does not impose any
    overhead at all as far as the MTU is concerned.  The current
    code incorrectly reduces the MTU by the size of the IPCOMP
    header.
    
    As a side-effect, this means that we don't have to move the
    IP header around when IPCOMP is used.

    which is not necessarily sizeof(struct tc_stats) due

    [IPV4]: Calculate default broadcast even when using SIOCSIGNETMASK.
    
    While getting hands-on with netkit (www.netkit.org), a networking
    simulation environment based on UML, it struck me that ifconfig wasn't
    capable of calculating the proper broadcast address for a subnetted
    interface. Some browsing through newsgroups and on the Debian package
    site (nettools), showed that this leads to misconfigured interfaces and
    a couple of bugreports on ifconfig.
    
    Digging a bit deeper revealed that it actually is an issue with
    SIOIFNETMASK. Once you bring up an interface with SIOIFADDR, a classfull
    netmask and broadcast address is set (if applicable for the type of
    interface), in order to get a properly configured interface. But if you
    subnet the network using SIOIFNETMASK no proper broadcast address is
    set. So you always have to calculate it yourself, obviously leading to
    configuration errors.
    
    This patch takes care of this. First of all it doesn't change
    existing functionality, eg. a command like 'ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.1
    netmask 255.255.255.240 broadcast 192.168.1.0' still works. But if you
    omit the broadcast address, a proper 'all ones' broadcast address for the
    subnet is set. 'ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.240' gives
    you 'eth0 inet addr:192.168.1.1 Bcast:192.168.1.15 Mask:255.255.255.240'
    and this should solve some real life problems.

    radeonfb: the Stanford lock checker found us double-locking rinfo->reg_lock
    via sequences like OUTPLL(foo, INPLL(bar) | baz ), as both OUTPLL and INPLL
    grab the register lock.  This should fix the problem.

    [PATCH] fix up physnode_map
    
    At the moment, we initialise physnode_map from the various BIOS tables,
    which can create problems, as holes inside an node return 1 for pfn_valid,
    and yet pfn_to_nid is not correct for them.  I'd hacked around this in my
    tree by defaulting the mapping to 0, not -1, but that's not the correct fix
    ...  this is.
    
    I consolidated all the code back into 1 place, and use node_start_pfn[] and
    node_end_pfn[] to walk over it instead - that means it matches up perfectly
    with lmem_map's as we're using the same data.  It also cleans up a lot of
    the code.
    
    Tested on both NUMA-Q and x440 ...  and it only affects i386 NUMA boxen.

    From: Linas Vepstas <linas@austin.ibm.com>
    
    When an RTAS call returns the "hardware error" code, we need to do another
    RTAS call to find out what went wrong.  Previously we weren't doing that
    inside the lock that serializes RTAS calls, and thus another cpu could get
    in and do another RTAS call in the meantime.  This patch fixes it.  This
    patch also includes some minor whitespace fixes.

    [PATCH] ppc64: EEH fixes for POWER5 machines (2/2)
    
    From: Linas Vepstas <linas@austin.ibm.com>
    
    This patch fixes the usage of the slot-error-detail log buffer for the
    Power5 architecture.  The size of the error buffer is variable, and the
    correct size to use should have been obtained from firmware.  Failure to
    use the correct buffer sizes will result in hard-to-debug system lockups
    deep in firmware.  This patch is based on an earlier patch from Ben
    Herrenschmidt, which essentially did the same thing.
    
    This patch also tweaks some of the subroutine documentation.

    From: Linas Vepstas <linas@austin.ibm.com>
    
    This patch allows ppc64 to boot on Power5 machines.  The new Power5 PCI
    bridge design requires EEH (enhanced PCI error handling) to be enabled for
    all PCI devices, not just some PCI devices.  In addition, this patch moves
    the check for PCI to ISA bridges out of perf critical code, and into
    initialization code.  This also avoids race conditions where the device
    type might not have been set.  Also, some whitespace fixes, and some
    error-message-printing beautification.

    This is more conservative in general, and so applies to multiple

    on the Intel ICH5/6 hardware.  On Intel ICH5/6, the BMDMA 'interrupt'
    status bit will be set even on non-DMA commands, which software
    (and I) did not expect.
    
    This change clears pending interrupts once upon initialization,
    and then each time ata_irq_on() is called.

    [PATCH] fbcon: optimization for accel_putcs()
    
    I did some simple benchmarking (time cat linux-2.6.7-mm5/MAINTAINERS)
    between 2.4 and 2.6 and I am not satisfied with what I see (It's claimed
    that fbdev-2.6 is faster than 2.4).  The reason for the claim:
    
    2.4 putcs - draw small amounts of data a lot of times
    2.6 putcs - draw larger amounts of data a fewer times
    
    The way characters are drawn in 2.6 is optimal for accelerated drivers but
    should also give a speed boost for drivers that rely on software drawing.
    However the penaly incurred when preparing a large bitmap from a number of
    small bitmaps is currently very high.  This is because of the following
    reasons:
    
    1 fb_move_buf_{aligned|unaligned} uses pixmap->{out|in}buf.  This is very
      expensive since outbuf and inbuf methods process only a byte or 2 of data
      at a time.
    
    2 fb_sys_outbuf (the default method for pixmap->outbuf) uses memcpy().
      Not a good choice if moving only a few bytes.
    
    3 fb_move_buf_unaligned (used for fonts such as 12x22) also involves a
      lot of bit operations + a lot of calls to outbuf/inbuf which
      proportionately increases the penaly.
    
    So, I thought of separating fb_move_buf_* to fb_iomove_buf_* and
    fb_sysmove_buf_*.
    
    	fb_iomove_buf_* - used if drivers specified outbuf and inbuf methods
    	fb_sysmove_buf_* - used if drivers have no outbuf or inbuf methods
    
    	*Most, if not all drivers fall in the second category.
    
    Below is a table that show differences between 2.4, 2.6 and 2.6 +
    abovementioned changes.  To reduce the effect of panning and
    fillrect/copyarea, the scrollmode is forced to redraw.

    Summary:
    
    1 2.6 unaccelerated is a bit faster than 2.4 when handling 8x16 fonts,
      with a higher speed differential at high color depths.
    
    2 2.4 unaccelerated is a bit faster than 2.6 when handling 12x22 fonts,
      with a smaller speed difference at high color depths (2.6 is actually a
      bit faster than 2.4 at 32bpp).
    
    3 2.4 rivafb accelerated suffers at high color depths, even becoming
      slower than unaccelerated, possibly because of the 'draw few bytes many
      times' method.
    
    4 2.6 rivafb accelerated has similar performance at any color depth,
      possibly because of 'draw lots of bytes a fewer times' method.
    
    5 With the changes, there is a speed gain of ~1.7 seconds and ~5.7
      seconds with 8x16 and 12x22 fonts respectively indepependent of the color
      depth or acceleration used.  The speed gain is constant but significant.
    
    Below is a patch against 2.6.7-mm5.  The effects will be very noticeable
    with drivers that uses SCROLL_REDRAW, but one should still see some speed
    gain even if SCROLL_YPAN/YWRAP is used.
    
    
    Separated fb_sys_move_* into fb_iosys_move_* and fb_sysmove_* to reduce
    penalty when constructing fb_image->data from character maps.  In my
    testcase (1024x768 SCROLL_REDRAW), I get a ~1.7 second advantage with 'time
    cat MAINTAINERS' using 8x16 fonts and ~5.7 seconds with 12x22 fonts.  The
    speed gain is independent of acceleration or color depth.

    - Silence interrupt source 0x01: it's rx error, no need to ask the end
    user to report it.
    - add support for vlan packets: The NvRegOffloadConfig register contains
    the maximum packet size, it was set to 1518 which caused vlan to fail.
    - fix bit flags for mii access: the wrong bit was polled and the mii
    write implementation was just broken.
    - Do not stop the rx/tx engines around mii accesses.
    - reset and reinit the phy during probe.

    [PATCH] fat/inode.c
    
    Two years ago, OGAWA Hirofumi removed some ugly code and
    added a few simple tests to the FAT filesystem code,
    intended to avoid recognizing non-FAT as FAT (for people who
    fail to specify rootfstype=, forcing the kernel to guess).
    
    That worked fairly well, until this year.
    
    I have now seen a thread in Czech and a report from Holland that
    involved the "FAT: bogus sectors-per-track value" error message.
    
    The patch below removes this test again. The advantage is that
    some real-life FAT filesystems can be mounted again.
    
    The disadvantage that more non-FAT fss will be accepted as FAT.

    [PATCH] PCI Hotplug: RPAPHP structure size/performance
    
    Please review and apply the following patch if you find it agreeable.
    
    This patch does not make any functional changes, but does improve
    both performance and memory usage by rearranging structure elements.
    
    The need for these changes became appearent during a code review of
    the disassembly involving this structure. The memory footprint of this
    structure is made smaller by grouping the byte fields next to each other.
    The access of the list_head can be simplified by making it the first element
    of the structure, thus avoiding a needless add-immediate without negatively
    impacting any of the other accesses.

    [PATCH] PCI: Add some PCI Express constants to pci.h
    
    This patch adds some PCI Express register constants to <linux/pci.h>
    
    For my device, setting the Max_Read_Request_Size value in the PCI
    Express device control register makes a huge performance difference.
    I wanted my driver code that does this to be a little more
    self-documenting than:
    
    	pci_read_config_word(mdev->pdev, cap + 8, &val);
    	val = (val & ~(5 << 12)) | (5 << 12);
    
    I went a little overboard and added all the basic device register
    fields.  If desired I could go even further overboard and add the
    link, slot and root registers as well.
    
    This patch is based on Matthew Wilcox's patch for pciutils, corrected
    for some PCI Express spec 1.0a changes.

    [PATCH] Telephony Driver ISAPNP fix
    
    I recently got an ISA Phonejack card and quickly found it wouldn't work
    with a stock 2.6.7 kernel.
    
    So found this bug in the ISAPNP part of the code, throughout the code it
    use it's own data structure to reference it's base IO address, in the
    ISAPNP code this was not being populated with any value hence it can't talk
    to the card and so the driver fails.

    [PATCH] Another batch of fbcon fixes
    
    - Update display->vrows when fbset changes certain fields in var (such as

      produce concommitant changes in other fields such as and especially
      var->yres_virtual.
    
    - Clear the FBINFO_MISC_MODECHANGEUSER flag _before_ issuing a
      notifier_call_chain().  Clearing it after the notifier_call_chain() will
      cause fbcon to go into an infinite loop.

    [PATCH] Mode Switch in fbcon_blank()
    
    As we've discussed in another thread, below is a diff that will do a set_par()
    as late as possible when there is KD_TEXT<->KD_GRAPHICS switch.  The set_par()
    will be forced in fbcon_resize() instead.
    
    Not sure if this has repercussions with the other drivers, but this patch
    fixed the X nv driver hanging when switching to the console.  (I believe the
    crash is actually caused by an early set_par() -- while in fbcon_blank.
    Removing the set_par in fbcon_blank fixed the hang but caused cursor sprite
    and display corruption).

    Now the cause of sparse warnings is that it does not handle runtime array
    dimensioning (which I take it is a sparse problem), but in this particular
    case it _might_ make sense to change the runtime allocation to compile
    time, as the upper size of the array is known, because the code in
    kernel/kallsyms.c clearly uses 127 (or 128) as "magic constant" for kernel
    symbol (array) length, and in the other hand in include/linux/module.h
    there is: #define MODULE_NAME_LEN (64 - sizeof(unsigned long))
    
    The only concern is that the array become quite big (the original comment
    of it being "pretty small" no longer applies ...).  One way to help that
    would be to use buffer[] also in place of namebuf[], but that would be
    little tricky as the format string should be before the symbol name ...

    case the timer expires immeadiatly).
    
    The standard is, IMNSOHO, a bit vague on just how repeating timers are to
    be handled so I made some choices:
    
    1) If an absolute timer is to expire every N intervals, we assume that
       the expiries should happen at those specified times after clock setting.
        I.e.  we adjust the repeat timer as well as the initial timer.  (The
       other option would be to treat the repeating timers as relative and not
       to adjust them.)
    
    2) If a clock set moves the the clock prior to the initial expiry time
       AND that time has already passed and been signaled, the current repeat
       timer is adjusted, i.e.  we DO NOT go back to the initial time and
       repeat that.  (The other option is to treat this case as a new request
       with the initial timer parameters (which by this time we have lost).)
    
    3) If time is advanced such that it appears that several expiries have
       been missed, the overrun count will reflect the misses.  (The other
       option is to not reflect this in the overrun.) At the same time, nothing
       is done to acknowledge, to the user, that we are repeating expiries when
       the clock is retarded.

    [PATCH] ppc64: janitor log_rtas_error() call arguments
    
    This patch from Linas Vepstas (rediffed by me) fixes the confusing argument
    aliasing of the log_rtas_error() subroutine.
    
    This patch makes no functional changes, it just cleans up some strange
    usage.
    
    The rtas_args used to communicate with firmware are always taken from the
    paca struct, so as to keep the args at a fixed, low-memory location.  But
    the log_rtas_error() routine also took an rtas_args pointer, which it
    assumed was aliased to the paca struct.  This aliasing is both
    un-neccessary, and confusing; this patch eliminates this confusion.

    [PATCH] ppc64: PACA cleanup
    
    Cleanup the PPC64 PACA structure.  It was previously a big mess of
    unecessary fields, overengineered cache layout and uninformative comments.
    This is essentially a rewrite of include/asm-pp64/paca.h with associated
    changes elsewhere.  The patch:
    
    - Removes unused PACA fields
    
    - Removes uneeded #includes
    
    - Uses gcc attributes instead of explicit padding to get the desired
      cacheline layout, also rethinks the layout and comments accordingly.
    
    - Better comments where asm or firmware dependencies apply non-obvious
      layout constraints.
    
    - Splits up the pointless STAB structure, letting us move its elements
      independently.
    
    - Uses offsetof instead of hardcoded offset in spinlocks.
    
    - Eradicates xStudlyCaps identifiers
    
    - Replaces PACA guard page with an explicitly defined emergency stack
      (removing more than NR_CPUS pages from the initialized data segment).

    [PATCH] ppc64: remove RTAS arguments from PACA
    
    This patch removes the RTAS arguments structure on ppc64 from the PACA.
    The args have to be in the RMO, but since we have a global spinlock for
    RTAS anyway, there's no reason to have a separate copy of the args per-CPU.
     This patch replaces the PACA field with a single instance in the global
    rtas structure.
    
    The one exception is for the rtas_stop_self() call, which can't take the
    lock, because it never returns.  But it has a fixed set of arguments, so we
    can use another global instance which is initialized at boot.
    
    This lets us remove rtas.h from paca.h, which substantially reduces overall
    #include hairiness (because paca.h is now, as it wants to be, a nice
    low-level structure-defining header which relies on very little and can
    safely be included almost anywhere).  Although it does add some noise to
    the patch, because a bunch of places relied on the indirect inclusion of
    rtas.h, or even more indirect inclusions (see the hunks applying to eeh.h
    and current.h!).

    [SERIAL] Remove UPF_RESOURCES
    
    The UPF_RESOURCES flag was added to the serial layer to cater for
    the idiosyncrasies of the PCMCIA layer, where the PCMCIA core code
    handles the claiming of busy resources.
    
    However, the PCMCIA core has progressed, and now does not claim busy
    resources - IOW, it now behaves just like any other bus driver,
    where resources are allocated non-busy and its up to the drivers to
    mark their regions busy using request_region / request_mem_region.
    
    The effect of this is that the UPF_RESOURCES hack in the serial
    layer is now redundant, and can now be removed - 8250 devices
    should now always use request_region / request_mem_region
    unconditionally.

    [PATCH] enable SMP Opterons boot an NX-enabled x86 kernel
    
    This fixes a corner-case NX bug: the x86 SMP kernel doesnt boot on SMP
    Opterons if NX is enabled [and mem=nopentium is specified], due to
    kernel-space NX protection preventing the SMP trampoline from being
    executable.
    
    Since the SMP trampoline is a rare case of 'dynamic code' executed by
    the kernel (it has to be below 640K so it cannot be part of the kernel
    text itself), i've added the necessary infrastructure to enable/disable
    executability of specific kernel pages.
    
    We cannot simply disable NX via the MSR because we've got the NX bits in
    the kernel pagetables, which are set up before we do the SMP bootup.
    The NX bit in the pagetables is undefined if EFER.NXE is 0, so we cannot
    count on NX-capable CPUs not faulting when they encounter them.
    
    I've tested the x86 kernel on a non-NX SMP x86 box and on an NX UP box,
    on which i've also tested a simulated SMP trampoline, it all works fine.
    
    - add infrastructure to enable/disable executability of kernel pages
    
    - make the SMP trampoline page executable.

    [netdrvr] disable certain drivers that are broken on 64-bit
    
    Disable Toshiba FIR IRDA driver (donauboe) and IBM Lanstreamer
    token ring driver on all 64-bit platforms.  Add #error to each driver
    explaining the problem, causing build of driver to fail when
    BITS_PER_LONG == 64.

    [PATCH] skfddi - fix warning
    
    The conversion to ANSI, caused a warning because the mulitcast code needs
    a cast.  dmi->dmi_addr is a u8 array, and fddi_addr is just a wrapper around a u8 array.

    [PATCH] PCMCIA net device unplugging ordering fix
    
    This is a rather old patch which re-orders the teardown of PCMCIA
    network devices.  Current device drivers remove the IO mappings,
    interrupts, and free any PCMCIA windows before they unregister
    themselves from the network layer.
    
    This patch ensures that we first unregister from the network layer
    before performing any teardown of resources or windows.
    
    Note: the only card which has been tested in this patch is pcnet_cs.

    [PATCH] get rid of __OPTIMIZE__ requirement in net drivers
    
    Several network drivers have checks that they are only built with -O.
    This breaks checking with sparse and other tools, and seems like a holdover from
    when drivers were built out of tree and the kernel build system was less stable.
    This patch gets rid of these.

    [PATCH] pcnet32: acknowledge all interrupts early.
    
    A recent change I made broke pcnet32 in a way that allowed real hardware
    to work, but broke VMWare.  This patch acknowledges all interrupts early
    in the pcnet32_interrupt while loop.  Without this patch on real hardware
    the first transmit operation would clear the 'init' interrupt, but in
    VMWare it would rain interrupts.  Keith Moore did more testing for me
    on VMWare and I did a better job testing on hardware.  Petr Vandrovec
    correctly pointed out the source of the problem on lkml.
    
    This patch is not needed for 2.4.27-rc1 unless my patch labeled
    "pcnet32: recover after rx hang" is applied (which it has not).

    [CRYPTO]: Add TEA and XTEA algorithms.
    
    The following is a patch against 2.6.7 (should apply cleanly to 2.6.5 or
    above).  It implements the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) and the
    Xtended TEA (XTEA) algorithms.  TEA goes back to 1994 and is a good
    algorithm espically for memory constrained systems.  It is similar in
    concept to the IDEA crypto.  It does NOT have any patent restrictions
    and has been put in the public domain by Wheeler and Needham.  Tea is used
    in quite a few products such as filesafe and even Microsoft's Xbox.

    ISA_DMA_THRESHOLD is a DMA mask which must be defined such that it

    by arch_adjust_zones.

    [PATCH] fix page->count discrepancy for zero page
    
    While writing some analysis tools for memory hot-remove, we came across a
    single page which had a ->count that always increased, without bound.  It
    ended up always being the zero page, and it was caused by a leaked
    reference in some do_wp_page() code that ends up avoiding PG_reserved
    pages.
    
    Basically what happens is that page_cache_release()/put_page() ignore
    PG_reserved pages, while page_cache_get()/get_page() go ahead and take the
    reference.  So, each time there's a COW fault on the zero-page, you get a
    leaked page->count increment.
    
    It's pretty rare to have a COW fault on anything that's PG_reserved, in
    fact, I can't think of anything else that this applies to other than the
    zero page.
    
    In any case, it the bug doesn't cause any real problems, but it is a bit of
    an annoyance and is obviously incorrect.  We've been running with this
    patch for about 3 months now, and haven't run into any problems with it.

    [PATCH] EDD: store mbr_signature on first 16 int13 devices
    
    Currently, the x86/x86_64 real-mode kernel setup code reads and stores the
    mbr_signature (4 bytes in the MBR at offset 440 decimal) for BIOS int13h
    device 80h only.  This is useful, but not as useful as if we stored such
    signatures for all int13h devices.  Think OS installer wanting to set up md
    software RAID across several BIOS disks.
    
    Patch below against 2.6.7 allows the storing of the mbr_signature for the
    first 16 BIOS int13h devices, and exports them via
    /sys/firmware/edd/int13_dev8x/mbr_signature as before.
    
    This also merges the three EXPORT_SYMBOLs that setup.c exported for edd.c's
    use into one.

    [PATCH] sh64: Fix syscall table alignment
    
    If the syscall table is in the text section, the movi that loads its
    address into a register will at link time have its immediates resolved as
    though it's an SHmedia symbol, i.e.  the LSB will be 1.  This is then
    misaligned as a base address for loading the address to jump to.
    
    This could be fixed either by moving the table back to the .data section
    (as done here), or by masking off the LSB after loading the table address
    into a register.

    [PATCH] sh64 support
    
    This patch adds sh64 support.
    
    This is a bit overdue, as this was on the should-fix list, though we
    weren't done debugging and finishing off the port until just recently (I
    did a port against 2.5.68 but it wasn't in any shape to be merged).
    
    sh64 is already in 2.4 and has been for quite awhile, so this is mostly
    just a forward port of that code to 2.6 with appropriate bug fixes, etc.
    along the way.  There isn't much in the way of new features that have been
    added to the port yet, though I have added rough hugetlb and oprofile
    support.
    
    This patch doesn't really touch any common code, with the exception of an
    ifdef or two for keyboard support and an ifdef in fb.h to omit sh64 from
    the __raw_xxx() wrapping that sh does.
    
    The only other common driver changes were to sh-sci for serial support, but
    those bits were already merged with the latest batch of sh-sci updates.
    
    Beyond that, the port is completely isolated.

    failing without this patch are Pentium II 300 MHz (Klamath) with

    [PATCH] binfmt misc fd passing via ELF aux vector
    
    The proposed patch uses the aux-vector to pass the fd of the open misc
    binary to the interpreter, instead of using argv[1] for that purpose.
    
    Previous patch - open_nonreadable_binaries, offered the option of
    binfmt_misc opening the binary on behalf of the interpreter.  In case
    binfmt_misc is requested to do that it would pass the file-descriptor of
    the open binary to the interpreter as its second argument (argv[1]).  This
    method of passing the file descriptor was suspected to be problematic,
    since it changes the command line that users expect to see when using tools
    such as 'ps' and 'top'.
    
    The proposed patch changes the method of passing the fd of the open binary
    to the translator.  Instead of passing it as an argument, binfmt_misc will
    request the ELF loader to pass it as a new element in the aux-vector that
    it prepares on the stack for ELF interpreter.  With this patch, argv[1]
    will hold the full path to the binary regardless of whether it opened it or
    not.

    We're now putting 24-byte structures into .init.setup via __setup.  But
    x86_64's compiler is emitting a `.align 16' in there, so they end up on

    [PATCH] ia64: fix reloc-out-of-range error on module loading
    
    I'm hitting this problem because the module I want to load was
    compiled with -g, so the filesize is absolutely huge.  kernel/module.c
    does a vmalloc() to inhale the entire file, and then two calls to
    module_alloc() (which calls vmalloc() on ia64) to load the 'init' and
    'core' sections. The 'init' is small and slips into a gap early in the
    vmalloc playspace, while the 'core' area is allocated after the huge
    area that was allocated for the inhaled copy of the whole file.
    
    I made a one coding change to Jean-Marc's version, adding a check to
    see whether the init/core sections are close enough together for the
    PCREL21B to reach (they almost always are).
    
    I've kept the test that there are no jumps from core to init (though
    the message that is printed is almost as unhelpful as the one that you
    get when you statically link a module into the kernel that has calls
    to the discarded .exit section :-)
    
    This patch stalled out before on the question of whether a PLT was
    overkill for a section-to-section branch, and whether it would be
    better to use relaxation techniques to extend the range.  Doing that
    might be more elegant in some way, but it needs a whole heap of extra
    code (to count how many relaxed branches need to be added and
    allocated them as needed).  This seems a lot of extra code that is
    only ever going to be exercised by maniacs like me with 49MB .ko
    files.
    
    I fixed up the comments to be a little more heplful.

    [PKT_SCHED]: Use get_jiffies_64()
    
    The packet scheduler simulates 64 bit jiffies on 32 bit platforms by running
    a timer keeping a mark and and offset.  Since there is no locking and this is
    racy and doesn't handle jiffie wrap real well.
    
    We can use get_jiffies_64 on 2.6 do get what is needed.
    The downside is the overhead of a function call, and a cache miss in
    get_jiffies_64.

    [PKT_SCHED]: Bad TDIFF_SAFE in csz.
    
    This code in the csz scheduler, is just plain broken.  The TDIFF_SAFE
    effectively expands to:
    	unsigned long delay = now - q->t_c;
    	if (delay > 0) {
    		delay = 0;
    		goto do_reset;
    	}
    	if (delay >> q->delta_log)
    
    So delay is always 0!  I assume that what was originally intended
    is the to keep delay bounded to 1<<q->delta_log.

    [PATCH] ia64: fix incorrect initialization of ar.k4 for BP
    
    The patch to move the current pointer for init_task from region 7 to

    improperly for the bootstrap processor.  Fix this by initializing it

    USB: fix bug where removing usb-serial modules or usb serial devices could oops
    
    This fixes the issue where the Generic driver would bind to all usb-serial
    devices, so the disconnect would not properly go to the real driver that
    controlled the device.  This was very bad when unloading the module with
    the device still connected.

    [NET]: Two tc action fixes.
    
    Another patchlet after turning on preempt and rerunning tests.
    - against dev.c is a genuine bug - i wish preempt would have
    given a more sane hint. Strange on how its a non issue when preempt is
    off.
    - against act_api.c is just an annoyance. I removed the kmod because it
    will only make sense to list actions if policies exist for that action.
    And if policies exist, the module would be loaded.

    [PATCH] ia64: Don't use -mtune=merced for gcc 3.4
    
    Gcc 3.4 has a new DFA scheduler for ia64. Unfortunately, it is not
    well tested for Itanium 1. When I tried to use gcc 3.4 to compile
    2.6 kernel configured for Merced, gcc failed in many places:
    
    http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15598
    http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15653
    http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15655
    http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16130
    http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16142
    http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16143
    
    Some of them have been fixed. But I am afraid many more remain. I don't
    know how many Itanium 1 machines left in production use. If people want
    to optimize kernel for Itanium 1, they can stick with the older gccs.
    Or they should upgrade their machines. I think the gcc developer's time
    should be better spent on somewhere else. I have been using this patch
    for a while, kernel seems to work OK.

    [PATCH] USB: Fix pegasus_set_multicast lockup in drivers/usb/net/pegasus.c
    
    I strongly recommend that this patch be applied.
    
    Without this patch, running tcpdump on an SMP machine with the
    pegasus adapter locks up 9 times out of 10.  This is what happens:
    
    CPU0				CPU1
    pegasus_start_xmit
    	netif_stop_queue
    				pegasus_set_multicast
    					netif_stop_queue
    					netif_wake_queue
    
    Which crashes if another packet is sent to pegasus_start_xmit before
    the first one is finished.
    
    If there are other drivers doing this, please fix them too.
    
    PS I submitted this to Petkan years ago but he probably lost it.

    [PATCH] USB Storage: unusual_devs.h addition
    
    took me a while to get my external usb drive running under linux-2.6.6,
    appears to need the appended fix. according to the header in unusual_devs.h
    one should send them to you, so here you go.
    
    the funny thing is that it works fine unter linux-2.6.0-test11 on different
    hardware, but then i'm out of my depth concerning what might have been
    changed in the usb driver in the meantime. i don't really follow the
    changes. i didn't find any real documentation about what these flags do,
    only a couple of "my usb drive worked with 2.4 but doesn't work any more
    with 2.6" messages on the web, and some of them pointed to unusual_devs.h. i
    do not claim to know what i've done with this fix, but i'd like to see it
    officially included. :-)

    [PATCH] sparse: fix ugly include/linux/efi.h typedef
    
    efi.h declares a function type, and then uses that as an argument to
    another function, and expects the compiler to magically demote the
    function to a function pointer.
    
    Even a gcc person (rth) was surprised that this was legal, and it
    doesn't match any other use of a function pointer in the kernel, and
    sparse doesn't like the implicit type-conversion.
    
    So make the type sane in the first place, instead of depending on
    a very weird corner case of the C language.

    [AIO]: kiocb->private is too large for kiocb's on-stack.
    
    sizeof(struct kiocb) is dangerously large for a structure commonly
    allocated on-stack. This patch converts the 24*sizeof(long) field,
    ->private, to a void pointer for use by file_operations entrypoints.
    A ->dtor() method is added to the kiocb in order to support the release
    of dynamically allocated structures referred to by ->private.
    
    The sole in-tree users of ->private are async network read/write,
    which are not, in fact, async, and so need not handle preallocated
    ->private as they would need to if ->ki_retry were ever used. The sole
    truly async operations are direct IO pread()/pwrite() which do not
    now use ->ki_retry(). All they would need to do in that case is to
    check for ->private already being allocated for async kiocbs.
    
    This rips 88B off the stack on 32-bit in the common case.

    [PATCH] fix GFP zone modifier interators
    
    For each node there are a defined list of MAX_NR_ZONES zones.  These are
    selected as a result of the __GFP_DMA and __GFP_HIGHMEM zone modifier flags
    being passed to the memory allocator as part of the GFP mask.  Each node
    has a set of zone lists, node_zonelists, which defines the list and order
    of zones to scan for each flag combination.  When initialising these lists
    we iterate over modifier combinations 0 ..  MAX_NR_ZONES.  However, this is
    only correct when there are at most ZONES_SHIFT flags.  If another flag is
    introduced zonelists for it would not be initialised.
    
    This patch introduces GFP_ZONETYPES (based on GFP_ZONEMASK) as a bound for
    the number of modifier combinations.

    [PATCH] Fix smbfs readdir oops
    
    This has been reported a couple of times and is consistently causing some
    folks grief, so Urban, would you mind terribly if i send this patch to at
    least clear current bug reports.  If there is additional stuff you want
    ontop of this let me know and i can send a follow up patch.
    
    The bug is that at times we haven't completed setting up the smb_ops so we
    have a temporary 'null' ops in place until the connection is completely up.
     With this setup it's possible to hit ->readdir() whilst the null ops are
    still in place, so we put the process to sleep until the connection setup
    is complete and then call the real ->readdir().

    [PATCH] Don't hold i_sem on swapfiles
    
    We permanently hold the i_sem of swapfiles so that nobody can addidentally
    ftruncate them, causing subsequent filesystem destruction.
    
    Problem is, it's fairly easy for things like backup applications to get
    stuck onthe swapfile, sleeping until someone does a swapoff.
    
    So take all that out again and add a new S_SWAPFILE inode flag.  Test that
    in the truncate path and refuse to truncate an in-use swapfile.
    
    Synchronisation between swapon and truncate is via i_sem.

    [PATCH] ext3: direct-io transaction extending fix
    
    ext3_direct_io_get_blocks() is misinterpreting the return value from
    ext3_journal_extend(), and is consequently running out of buffer credits and
    going BUG on tremendously large direct-io writes.  Fix that up.
    
    Also, I note that the really large direct-io writes can hold a transaction
    open for the entire duration, which can be minutes.  This violates ext3's
    attempt to commit data at regular intervals.  Fix that up by looking at the
    transaction state: if it's T_LOCKED, shut off the current handle so the
    pending commit can complete.

    [PATCH] anon_vma list locking bug
    
    Vladimir Saveliev reported anon_vma_unlink list_del BUG (LKML 24 June).
    His testing is still in progress, but we believe it comes from a nasty
    locking deficiency I introduced in 2.6.7's anon_vma_prepare.
    
    Andrea's original anon_vma_prepare was fine, it needed no anon_vma lock
    because it was always linking a freshly allocated structure; but my
    find_mergeable enhancement let it adopt a neighbouring anon_vma, which of
    course needs locking against a racing linkage from another mm - which the
    earlier adjust_vma fix seems to have made more likely.
    
    Does anon_vma->lock nest inside or outside page_table_lock?  Inside, but
    that's not obvious without a lock ordering list: instead of listing the
    order here, update the list in filemap.c; but a separate patch because
    that's less urgent and more likely to get wrong or provoke controversy.
    
    (Could do it with anon_vma lock after dropping page_table_lock, but a long
    comment explaining why some code is safe suggests it's not.)

    Clean up the script. This also makes it two times faster. (Thanks to
    Herve Eychenne.)
    
    - moved variable definitions to the top, for easier configuration
    - the script contains bashisms, so make it /bin/bash
    - use sed -e'...' -e '...' instead of sed | sed
    - avoid subshells: () changed to {}

    [PATCH] fix NUMA boundaray between ZONE_NORMAL and HIGHMEM
    
    From: Andy Whitcroft <apw@shadowen.org>
    
    This patch eliminates the false hole which can form between ZONE_NORMAL and
    ZONE_HIGHMEM.  This is most easily seen when 4g/4g split is enabled, but
    it's always broken, and we just happen not to hit it most of the time.
    Basically, the patch changes the allocation of the numa remaps regions (the
    source of the holes) such that they officially fall within VMALLOC space,
    where they belong.
    
    Tested in -mjb for a couple of months, and again against 2.6.7-mm1.

    Hit a kernel oops on 2.6.7 kernel when doing direct I/O to hugetlb page.
    
    The destructor of compound page was moved into page->mapping since 2.6.6.
    It got interfered with set_page_dirty() for hugetlb page: an O_DIRECT read
    into first tail page of the compound page will fool set_page_dirty() to
    deference page->mapping->a_ops and then kernel oops.  Patch to fix the

    [PATCH] Permit root to choose vfat policy to UTF8
    
    Right now the kernel detects the sysadmin trying to set the iocharset of
    vfat to UTF8 and prevents this with an error.  While I can see that this is
    not recommended, enforcing this is policy that probably doesn't belong in
    the kernel.  The patch below makes this situation a warning and a
    recommendation instead of a strong blockage.
    
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=126641
    
    is an example of a sysadmin disliking this policy enforcement.

    [PATCH] SELinux: fix build with CONFIG_SECURITY_NETWORK=n
    
    SELinux should just drop out the socket and netfilter hooks when that is

    The problem was introduced because of the fine-grained netlink patches,
    which made the selinux_netlink_send/recv hook functions depend on
    CONFIG_SECURITY_NETWORK but the netlink_send/recv hooks themselves are not
    dependent on it.
    
    Need to move selinux_netlink_send/recv back out of the conditional block,
    and provide a static inline stub for selinux_nlmsg_perm if
    CONFIG_SECURITY_NETWORK is not defined.

    [PATCH] Fix race between CONFIG_DEBUG_SLABALLOC and modules
    
    store_stackinfo() does an unlocked module list walk during normal runtime
    which opens up a race with the module load/unload code.  This can be
    triggered by simply unloading and loading a module in a loop with
    CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC resulting in store_stackinfo() tripping over bad
    list pointers.
    
    kernel_text_address doesn't take any locks, because during an OOPS we don't
    want to deadlock.  Rename that to __kernel_text_address, and make
    kernel_text_address take the lock.

    [PATCH] make __free_pages_bulk more comprehensible
    
    I find __free_pages_bulk very hard to understand ...  (I was trying to mod
    it for the non MAX_ORDER aligned zones, and cleaned it up first).  This
    should make it much more comprehensible to mortal man ...  I benchmarked
    the changes on the big 16x and it's no slower (actually it's about 0.5%
    faster, but that's within experimental error).
    
    I moved the creation of mask into __free_pages_bulk from the caller - it
    seems to really belong inside there.  Then instead of doing wierd limbo
    dances with mask, I made it use order instead where it's more intuitive.
    Personally I find this makes the whole thing a damned sight easier to
    understand.

    [PATCH] NX (No eXecute) support for x86
    
    we'd like to announce the availability of the following kernel patch:
    
         http://redhat.com/~mingo/nx-patches/nx-2.6.7-rc2-bk2-AE
    
    which makes use of the 'NX' x86 feature pioneered in AMD64 CPUs and for
    which support has also been announced by Intel. (other x86 CPU vendors,
    Transmeta and VIA announced support as well. Windows support for NX has
    also been announced by Microsoft, for their next service pack.) The NX
    feature is also being marketed as 'Enhanced Virus Protection'. This
    patch makes sure Linux has full support for this hardware feature on x86
    too.
    
    What does this patch do? The pagetable format of current x86 CPUs does
    not have an 'execute' bit. This means that even if an application maps a
    memory area without PROT_EXEC, the CPU will still allow code to be
    executed in this memory. This property is often abused by exploits when
    they manage to inject hostile code into this memory, for example via a
    buffer overflow.
    
    The NX feature changes this and adds a 'dont execute' bit to the PAE
    pagetable format. But since the flag defaults to zero (for compatibility
    reasons), all pages are executable by default and the kernel has to be
    taught to make use of this bit.
    
    If the NX feature is supported by the CPU then the patched kernel turns
    on NX and it will enforce userspace executability constraints such as a
    no-exec stack and no-exec mmap and data areas. This means less chance
    for stack overflows and buffer-overflows to cause exploits.
    
    furthermore, the patch also implements 'NX protection' for kernelspace
    code: only the kernel code and modules are executable - so even
    kernel-space overflows are harder (in some cases, impossible) to
    exploit. Here is how kernel code that tries to execute off the stack is
    stopped:
    
     kernel tried to access NX-protected page - exploit attempt? (uid: 500)
     Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address f78d0f40
      printing eip:
     ...
    
    The patch is based on a prototype NX patch written for 2.4 by Intel -
    special thanks go to Suresh Siddha and Jun Nakajima @ Intel. The
    existing NX support in the 64-bit x86_64 kernels has been written by
    Andi Kleen and this patch is modeled after his code.
    
    Arjan van de Ven has also provided lots of feedback and he has
    integrated the patch into the Fedora Core 2 kernel. Test rpms are
    available for download at:
    
        http://redhat.com/~arjanv/2.6/RPMS.kernel/
    
    the kernel-2.6.6-1.411 rpms have the NX patch applied.
    
    here's a quickstart to recompile the vanilla kernel from source with the
    NX patch:
    
        http://redhat.com/~mingo/nx-patches/QuickStart-NX.txt
    
    update:
    
     - make the heap non-executable on PT_GNU_STACK binaries.
    
     - make all data mmap()s (and the heap) executable on !PT_GNU_STACK
       (legacy) binaries. This has no effect on non-NX CPUs, but should be
       much more compatible on NX CPUs. The only effect it has it has on
       non-NX CPUs is the extra 'x' bit displayed in /proc/PID/maps.

    [PATCH] larger IO bitmaps
    
    The previous discussion was started here:
    http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0211.0/0477.html but in 2.4
    times this was kind of problematic.
    
    Now, with the lazy bitmap allocation and per-CPU TSS, this will really not
    drain any resources I think.  8K TSS increase and 8K per process *that does
    ioperm()* - I think it is not very bad.
    
    The reasons why I need that, are described in the URL above.  Basically this
    will allow to use full-screen VESA under dosemu (without LFB though), and this
    may be also helpfull for the XFree project and some other projects:

    [PATCH] __alloc_bootmem_node should not panic when it fails
    
    __alloc_bootmem_node currently panics if it cant satisfy an allocation for
    a particular node.  Thats rather antisocial, we should at the very least
    return NULL and allow the caller to proceed (eg try another node).
    
    A quick look at alloc_bootmem_node usage suggests we should fall back to
    allocating from other nodes if it fails (as arch/alpha/kernel/pci_iommu.c
    and arch/x86_64/kernel/setup64.c do).
    
    The following patch does that.  We fall back to the regular __alloc_bootmem
    when __alloc_bootmem_node fails, which means all other nodes are checked
    for available memory.

    [PATCH] Add PCDP console detection support
    
    Add support for the EFI/DIG PCDP console discovery table (see
    http://www.dig64.org/specifications/DIG64_HCDPv20_042804.pdf).
    
    This moves the code from drivers/serial/8250_hcdp.[ch] to
    drivers/firmware/pcdp.[ch], since it's no longer 8250-specific.  It also
    obsoletes CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_HCDP, replacing it with CONFIG_EFI_PCDP (which
    defaults to Y for ia64).
    
    In a nutshell, HCDP tells us "these UARTs are available for use as a
    console," and it's up to the user to explicitly specify the console device.
     The kernel can guess in some cases, but not all.
    
    The PCDP (aka HCDP v2) tells us what we really want to know, namely, "this
    UART or VGA device is the console device." (It also has provision for
    support for new device types.)

    Okay, here's a resend vs current scsi-misc-2.6 that has your three

    [PATCH] fdomain screwup
    
    | From: Andrew Morton
    | To: linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org
    | Subject: fdomain screwup
    |
    | - fdomain_setup() is marked __init, but is called from non-__init
    |   fdomain_16x0_detect()
    |
    | - fdomain_setup() is declared in drivers/scsi/pcmcia/fdomain_stub.c as
    |   taking two arguments, but is implemented in fdomain_setup() taking a
    |   single argument.
    |
    |   Please, never ever ever put extern function declarations in .c files.
    |   Put it in a header file which is visible to the definition and to all
    |   callsites.
    |
    | - fdomain_setup() is declared static, hence the linkage fails.
    |
    | - fdomain_16x0_bus_reset() is implemented in drivers/scsi/fdomain.c but
    |   has static scope, so the call from drivers/scsi/pcmcia/fdomain_stub.c
    |   doesn't work.
    
    [I didn't find this to be the case, so I didn't fix it.]
    
    | - fdomain_16x0_bus_reset() has an extern declaration in
    |   drivers/scsi/pcmcia/fdomain_stub.c.  This should be moved to a header
    |   file which is visible to etc...
    
    Builds and loads.  No hardware to test.

    a patch though and left it to me whether we'd merged it despite only

    I've left the check in esp_input just in case someone adds a non-ESP encap

    [PATCH] ia64: trashing bootmem on non-NUMA boxes
    
    call_pernode_memory() is rounding memory regions to page boundaries,
    but in the non-NUMA case, it's incorrectly passing the rounded start and
    the original length.  Any reserved memory regions sitting beyond a
    memory region that isn't nicely aligned is potentially at risk for
    getting freed and trashed.  This is a fairly nasty bug that can bite in
    very hard to find ways.  In my case, the EFI memory map was getting
    overwritten, causing the ACPI methods to access chipset registers
    cachable instead of uncachable.  It could potentially be causing some of
    the random hangs and strange behavior we're seeing lately.

    [PATCH] isofs fixes
    
    This fixes two things.
    
    On the one hand we have the old "cruft" mount option, that sometimes was
    enabled automatically, for ridiculously large files or CDROMs.  But what
    was ridiculous ten years ago, no longer is.  So, only decide that
    something is cruft when the user said so.
    
    On the other hand, sometimes we get negative sizes.  That is caused by
    assignments inode->i_size = isonum_733(), where the latter was declared
    integer.  I made it unsigned int, as the standard also does.

    Here is the patch to check encap_type at the earliest possible

    [IPSEC]: Check encap_type at config time.
    
    The following patch moves the udp->encap_type check from the per-packet
    hot-path into udp_setsockopt().
    
    As a consequence, this allows user space to detect whether the kernel
    actually supports the encap type that they're requesting.  Pity no one
    did this before the NON-IKE patch was applied.  As it is there is no
    easy way to detect whether NON-IKE support is present.

    [PATCH] USB: PWC 9.0.1
    
    Attached you will find patches that will bring the PWC driver in the kernel
    up to version 9.0.1 from 8.12 (9.0 wasn't accepted at first). Patches are
    against 2.4.26 and 2.6.7. The main difference with 9.0 is that the
    video_relase() routine is now hopefully in line with kernel requirements.
    I've also added one more ioctl() call, upon request.
    
    I'm also slightly in the dark on the status of the PWC in the 2.6 kernel;
    I've seen two patches: the first was a bad one, since it would crash your
    kernel when you unplug the cam. I've seen a second patch to reverse the
    first one, but I don't know if that went in. Either way, you might get a
    conflict in pwc-if.c in and about the pwc_video_release() routine; this
    patch was generated against the clean 2.6.7 kernel source. Should you need
    or want to fix it manually, this patch should remove the
    pwc_video_release() in the 2.6 kernel.

    the iRiver H100 series, occasionally transfer 0 bytes with GOOD status.
    This change will make the sd driver aware that something unexpected has

    [PATCH] USB: gadgetfs AIO support
    
    This patch adds AIO support to gadgetfs, letting user mode programs use
    "libaio" to manage USB I/O concurrency with the same API as they may
    already be using for disk files.  In particular, it's practical to
    stream isochronous data to/from userspace using this API, by keeping
    an endpoint's I/O queue from emptying.
    
    Each AIO "iocb" in userspace corresponds directly to one "usb_request"
    (and one kiocb) in the kernel.  Their lifecycles, including cancelation,
    overlap completely.  That's much of why the patch is so small (surprised
    the heck out of me!); that, and using copy_{to,from}_user() rather than
    trying fancy dma mapping tricks to attain zerocopy nirvana.
    
    The kernel AIO module forgot to export kick_iocb(), so this adds the
    missing declaration ... needed when using gadgetfs as a module.

    a ZLP ... they can just send one if the host asks, or start the status
    stage whenever the host thinks it's time.  Other controllers make it hard
    to be forgiving in those cases.
    
    This patch updates all the gadget drivers to explicitly set the req->zero
    flag to reflect whether the USB spec says a ZLP "must" be sent by the
    device.  "Forgiving" drivers won't notice the change, but the others need
    to see this information passed down from the gadget driver.

    [PATCH] USB: Add mb() during initialization of UHCI controller
    
    In a recent thread it was mentioned that some architectures, such as PPC,
    do not guarantee relative ordering between different varieties of
    processor/device data transfers.  This patch adds an mb() instruction to
    the UHCI driver, to insure that the data structures in memory (cached by
    the CPU and accessed by DMA) are fully flushed before the controller is
    started (by regular bus IO).

    [PATCH] USB: Imiprove usb_device tracking in dummy_hcd
    
    A tricky problem the dummy_hcd driver has to solve is keeping track of the
    usb_device structure that corresponds to a registered gadget.  Right now
    that's not done very robustly.  This patch stores the address of the
    structure when a new URB is submitted and also acquires a reference to
    make sure that completing the final URB won't deallocate the structure
    before dummy_hcd is through with it.

    [PATCH] USB: EHCI IRQ tweaks
    
    Various tweaks to EHCI IRQ handling, these may affact some systems.
    
     - Delays enabling IRQs until the root hub is more fully set up, so
       any "resume detect" IRQs can be handled properly.  (Craig Nadler)
    
     - Power down ports on driver shutdown.  (Craig Nadler)
    
     - Remove some duplicate irq-sharing logic that somehow crept in; check
       only once, and return IRQ_NONE to detect IRQ storms better (db)
    
     - Minor comment fix re integrated TTs.  (db)

    [PATCH] symlink 1/9: infrastructure and explanation
    
    This patch-kit gets past the limit on nested symlinks, without
    incompatible API changes _and_ with killing code duplication in most of
    the readlink/follow_link pairs.  And no, it's not the old ->getlink()
    crap - procfs et.al.  are not special-cased there.
    
    Here's how it works:
     * ->follow_link() still does what it used to do - replaces
       vfsmount/dentry in the nameidata it got from caller.  However, it can
       also leave a pathname to be resolved by caller.
     * we add an array of char * into nameidata; we always work with
       nd->saved_names[current->link_count].  nd_set_link() sets it,
       nd_get_link() returns it.
     * callers of ->follow_link() (all two of them) check if ->follow_link()
       had left us something to do.  If it had (return value was zero and
       nd_get_link() is non-NULL), they do __vfs_follow_link() on that name.
       Then they call a new method (->put_link()) that frees whatever has to
       be freed, etc.
    
    Note that absolute majority of symlinks have "resolve a pathname" as
    part of their ->follow_link(); they can do something else and some don't
    do that at all, but having that pathname resolution is very, very
    common.
    
    With that change we allow them to shift pathname resolution part to
    caller.  They don't have to - it's perfectly OK to do all work in
    ->follow_link().  However, leaving the pathname resolution to caller
    will
       a) exclude foo_follow_link() stack frame from the picture
       b) kill 2 stack frames - all callers are in fs/namei.c
    and they can use inlined variant of vfs_follow_link().
    
    That reduction of stack use is enough to push the limit on nested
    symlinks from 5 to 8 (actually, even beyond that, but since 8 is common
    for other Unices it will do fine).
    
    For those who have "pure" ->follow_link() (i.e.  "find a string that
    would be symlink contents and say nd_set_link(nd, string)") we also get
    a common helper implementing ->readlink() - it just calls
    ->follow_link() on a dummy nameidata, calls vfs_readlink() on result of
    nd_get_link() and does ->put_link().  Using (or not using) it is up to
    filesystem; it's a helper that can be used as a ->readlink() for many
    filesystems, not a reimplementation of sys_readlink().  However, that's
    _MANY_ filesystems - practically all of them.
    
    Note that we don't put any crap like "if this is a normal symlink, do
    this; otherwise call ->follow_link() and let it do its magic" into
    callers - all symlinks are handled the same way.  Which was the main
    problem with getlink proposal back then.
    
    That covers almost everything; the only cases left are nfs, ncpfs and
    cifs.  Those will go later - we are backwards compatible, so it's not a
    problem.
    
    First patch: infrastructure - helpers allowing ->follow_link() to leave
    a pathname to be traversed by caller + corresponding code in callers.

    There is a problem in the hpt366.c driver where the function

    speed variable.  The speed variable should use the value returned by
    hpt3xx_ratefilter which decides the speed after checking against the bad

    [PATCH] sparse: trivial drivers/char/* annotation and format fixes
    
     - trivial annotation in several places in drivers/mtd
     - a bunch of debugging printks switched from %x to %llx (they get 64bit
       values)
     - in doc200[01].c fixed type of (unused) last argument in their
       doc_read_ecc().

    [PATCH] revert partition nonsense
    
    Updating my source to 2.6.7 I see that you applied some
    nonsense garbage patch. Please undo.
    
    [ Note by Linus: the fact that DOS_EXTENDED_PARTITION is 5, and we're
      iterating over slots 1-4 in the partition table, are two totally
      unrelated things. Using the symbolic constant does indeed not make
      any sense at all here, as Andries so eloquently points out. ]

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix booting on LPAR machines with more than 1 CPU
    
    The exception rewrite contains a small bug that prevents bring up of CPUs
    on logically partitioned machines.
    
    The kernel is trying to zero the backlink on the new stack while running
    with relocation disabled, which potentially cause it to try to access an
    address outside of the region allowed in real mode.  This seem to be a
    leftover from previous code as we also zero the backlink later after
    turning off the MMU.
    
    This patch removes the offending bit.

    [PATCH] Better memset
    
    Anton noticed in some traces that we were spending an awfully long time
    doing a memset.  The ppc64 memset is basically unchanged from the ppc32
    version, and it only does 4-byte stores and doesn't unroll the loop.
    Here's a memset that performs a bit better.
    
    I have been using it for 3 weeks now, and Anton has tested it on a
    variety of machines, without problems.

    [PATCH] ppc64: clean up prom.c and related files
    
    Somebody back in the mists of time decided that call_prom and rtas_call
    should return longs even though both of those bits of firmware run in
    32-bit mode and produce a 32-bit result.  To make life more interesting,
    the 32-bit result gets zero-extended to 64 bits, which makes checking
    for a -1 return value more complicated than it should be.
    
    This patch changes call_prom and rtas_call to return an int, and makes
    the corresponding changes to use ints for the variables used to hold
    those return values.
    
    While I was doing this I finally got annoyed enough with the strings of
    prom_print() and prom_print_hex() calls that we do to write a simple
    prom_printf.  I deliberately didn't use snprintf because the execution
    environment is weird at this point - we aren't running at the address we
    are linked at just yet - and I didn't want to inflict that on any code
    outside this file.  I also did a prom_debug() macro, which eliminated a
    few ifdefs.
    
    There are also a bunch of other minor cleanups.  This patch makes very
    few algorithmic changes but does get rid of a lot of casts.  :)
    
    I have been running with this patch for a couple of weeks, and Anton has
    tested it too.

    [PATCH] fix x86-64 ptrace access to 32-bit vsyscall page
    
    When I made get_user_pages support looking up a pte for the "gate" area, I
    assumed it would be part of the kernel's fixed mappings.  On x86-64 running
    a 32-bit task, the 32-bit vsyscall DSO page still has no vma but has its
    pte allocated in the user mm in the normal fashion.  This patch makes it
    use the generic page-table lookup calls rather than the shortcuts.
    With this, ptrace on x86-64 can access a 32-bit process's vsyscall page.
    
    The behavior on x86 is unchanged.

    [PATCH] oom killer: ignore free swapspace
    
    From: William Lee Irwin III <wli@holomorphy.com>
    
    During stress testing at Oracle to determine the maximum number of clients
    2.6 can service, it was discovered that the failure mode of excessive
    numbers of clients was kernel deadlock.  The following patch removes the
    check if (nr_swap_pages > 0) from out_of_memory() as this heuristic fails
    to detect memory exhaustion due to pinned allocations, directly causing the
    aforementioned deadlock.

    [PATCH] hugetlb.c - fix try_to_free_low()
    
    From: "Chen, Kenneth W" <kenneth.w.chen@intel.com>
    
    Turn on CONFIG_HIGHMEM and CONFIG_HUGETLBFS.  Try to config the hugetlb
    pool:
    
    [root@quokka]# echo 100 > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages
    [root@quokka]# grep HugePage /proc/meminfo
    HugePages_Total:   100
    HugePages_Free:    100
    
    [root@quokka]# echo 20 > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages
    [root@quokka]# grep HugePage /proc/meminfo
    HugePages_Total:     0
    HugePages_Free:      0
    
    [root@quokka]# echo 100 > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages
    [root@quokka]# grep HugePage /proc/meminfo
    HugePages_Total:   100
    HugePages_Free:    100
    
    [root@quokka]# echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages
    [root@quokka]# grep HugePage /proc/meminfo
    HugePages_Total:    31
    HugePages_Free:     31
    
    The argument "count" passed to try_to_free_low() is the config parameter
    for desired hugetlb page pool size.  But the implementation took that input
    argument as number of pages to free.  It also decrement the config
    parameter as well.  All give random behavior depend on how many hugetlb
    pages are in normal/highmem zone.
    
    A two line fix in try_to_free_low() would be:
    
    -			if (!--count)
    -				return 0;
    +			if (count >= nr_huge_pages)
    +				return count;
    
    But more appropriately, that function shouldn't return anything.

    [PATCH] consolidate in-kernel configuration
    
    From: Andy Whitcroft <apw@shadowen.org>
    
    Being able to recover the configuration from a kernel is very useful and it
    would be nice to default this option to Yes.  Currently, to have the config
    available both from the image (using extract-ikconfig) and via /proc we
    keep two copies of the original .config in the kernel.  One in plain text
    and one gzip compressed.  This is not optimal.
    
    This patch removes the plain text version of the configuration and updates
    the extraction tools to locate and use the gzip'd version of the file.
    This has the added bonus of providing us with the exact same results in
    both cases, the original .config; including the comments.

    [PATCH] cirrusfb: major update
    
    From: David Eger <eger@havoc.gtf.org>
    
    This patch brings the cirrusfb driver up to date with 2.6.  cirrusfb has
    suffered bit rot like you wouldn't believe (last updated...  2.3.x era?).
    The driver will now compile again, and you can change to a high resolution
    text mode with stty.  Known defects: doesn't play nice with X, nor fbset.
    
    C = Cosmetic change
    L = Logical change
    A = API change
    W = register Writing change
    
    (1-CA) fb_info and cirrusfb_info:
       - mostly cosmetic, but a lot less confusing, and no more nasty casting.
    
      It used to be stylish to embed struct fb_info_gen (now struct fb_info)
      as the first member of struct clgenfb_info (now struct cirrusfb_info),
      and then you'd cast to the deisred struct.
      Now we pass the size of our data structure to framebuffer_alloc(),
      and we make fb_info and cirrusfb_info reference each other with
      pointers (as in radeonfb).
    
      In the old code, there two declarations were common:
    
      clgenfb_info *fb_info;
      clgenfb_info *info;
    
      since there's also a 'struct fb_info' now, I found this really confusing,
      and unified usage as:
    
      cirrusfb_info *cinfo;
      fb_info *info;
    
      This accounts for a lot of the search and replace cosmetic upgrade.
    
    (2-A) All of the FB knowledge of FB internals is gone in 2.6
    
    (3-LW) revised maxclock numbers (cirrusfb_board_info_rec.maxclock[5])
    
    	In my quest to get fbset to work, I borrowed some maxclock data
    	from the X.Org tree for various chipsets.  It didn't really seem
    	to help.  oh well.
    
    (3-LA) upgraded PCI registration
    
    	Instead of doing PCI walking from the driver, we hand off a
    	pci_device_id table to the PCI subsystem and just get called when
    	it finds a relevant board.
    
    (4-L) striking lots of __init and __initdata specifiers
    
    	I was running into some things not working when I moved the call to
    	init_vgachip() from the driver registration to set_par().  I thought
    	perhaps this was due to some things being marked __init accidentally
    	so I axed said annotations.  Turns out it was something else.  See 5.
    
    (5-LA) delayed chip initialization, nasty double-set_par() pseudo-bug
    
      Tony says that the fb drivers shouldn't do any chipset initialization
      until they get a set_par() call.  This way, fb modules can be safely
      unloaded if no one gets around to using them, and the vga_con -> fbcon
      hand off is smoother, as fbcon can still grab the back-scroll data from
      vga_con...
    
      In any case, moving the calls to init_vgachip() and fbgen_do_set_var()
      from driver initialization to set_par() revealed that the cirrus
      register-writing function needs to be called twice for a mode change to
      work.  I don't understand why.
    
    (6-LA) split clgen_decode_var() into the bits that check the var and the
      bits that actually generate register information (par/regs) to write
    
      Adding modedb hooks here might actually fix fbset, i think...
    
    (7-LW) No longer write the palette in init_vgachip() nor in set_par().
      Someone else (fbcon?) seems to be making its own calls to setcolreg()
      for us.
    
    (8-LW) setcolreg() -- while removing all of the console cruft, I had
      to try to reconstitute the palette code. I think I got this right,
      but I could be off -- the penguin boots in the correct colors at least ;-)
    
    (9-L) pan_display() - we don't do wrap, silly. that's only on the amiga.
    
    (10-L) pan+BLT - to make pan play nicely with copyarea()/fillrect()
       I had to add a couple of calls to cirrusfb_WaitBLT() to make sure
    	the engine is idle.
    
    (11-LW) cirrusfb_blank() - I upgraded the switch here to use the new
      VESA_* blanking mode constants.  I think I translated the right
      logic for the right blanking levels.

    In 2.4, OProfile allowed normal users to trigger sample dumps (useful under
    low sample load).  The patch below, by Will Cohen, allows this for 2.6 too.

    [PATCH] Fix early CPU vendor detection for non intel cpus
    
    From: Andi Kleen <ak@suse.de>
    
    Early CPU detect can only work after the various sub CPU drivers have
    registered their devices.
    
    Currently the vendor would be always 0, which is Intel.
    
    This prevents Athlons from being recognized as buggy PPros and fixes some
    other workarounds for non Intel CPUs too.

    [PATCH] MIPS Update
    
    From: Ralf Baechle <ralf@linux-mips.org>
    
    MIPS update:
    
     - Further conversion of MIPS kernel configuration to reverse dependencies.
     - Support for the PMC-Sierra Yosemite evaluation board.
     - Merge arch/mips/mm-32 and arch/mips/mm-32 into arch/mips/mm.
     - Partial support for the R8000 now that I finally have clearance for the
       documentation previously covered by NDA.
     - Make distclean fixes.
     - Regenerate default configuration files against latest Kconfig files.
     - Fix handling of data bus errors in modules.
     - Make R4000 bug probing more bullet proof.
     - Rewrite semaphore code folloing the PPC implementation to no longer
       manipulate 2 32-bit quantities atomically using 64-bit instructions.
       Occasionally this did cause problems due to struct semaphore not having
       sufficient alignment.
     - Make sys_pipe() code bullet proof against gcc 3.5 over-optimization.
     - Fix possibly exploitable bug in IRIX compatibility statvfs(2).
     - Make sched_clock() an outline function.
     - Support for the MIPS 24K and 25K processors.
     - Make functions static that aren't needed anywhere else.
     - Factor out some more generic MIPS SMP code.
     - Factor out common part of the GT-64240 code.
     - Ocelot C now uses the generic MV-64340 interrupt handler code.
     - Factor out common board support code
     - More cleanup and bug fixes for the NEC VR41xx code.
     - Start cleanup of hazard handling as required for MIPS32/64 V2 processors.
     - Enforce minimal kmalloc alignment of 8 byte so 64-bit registers can be
       stored into fields without exceptions.
     - Speeling and warning fixes.

    I can find and fix those if you want).

    [PATCH] nr_pagecache can go negative
    
    We use per-cpu counters for the system-wide pagecache accounting.  The

    overflow.
    
    Hence it is possible, under weird circumstances, for nr_pagecache to go

    [PATCH] reduce function inlining in slab.c
    
    From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
    
    slab.c contains too many inline functions:
    
    - some functions that are not performance critical were inlined.  Waste
      of text size.
    
    - The debug code relies on __builtin_return_address(0) to keep track of
      the callers.  According to rmk, gcc didn't inline some functions as
      expected and that resulted in useless debug output.  This was probably
      caused by the large debug-only inline functions.
    
    The attached patche removes most inline functions:
    
    - the empty on release/huge on debug inline functions were replaced with
      empty macros on release/normal functions on debug.
    
    - spurious inline statements were removed.
    
    The code is down to 6 inline functions: three one-liners for struct
    abstractions, one for a might_sleep_if test and two for the performance
    critical __cache_alloc / __cache_free functions.
    
    Note: If an embedded arch wants to save a few bytes by uninlining
    __cache_{free,alloc}: The right way to do that is to fold the functions
    into kmem_cache_xy and then replace kmalloc with
    kmem_cache_alloc(kmem_find_general_cachep(),).

    [PATCH] hwcache align kmalloc caches
    
    From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
    
    Reversing the patches that made all caches hw cacheline aligned had an
    unintended side effect on the kmalloc caches: Before they had the
    SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN flag set, now it's clear.  This breaks one sgi driver -
    it expects aligned caches.  Additionally I think it's the right thing to
    do: It costs virtually nothing (the caches are power-of-two sized) and
    could reduce false sharing.
    
    Additionally, the patch adds back the documentation for the
    SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN flag.

    [PATCH] tweak the buddy allocator for better I/O merging
    
    From: William Lee Irwin III <wli@holomorphy.com>
    
    Based on Arjan van de Ven's idea, with guidance and testing from James
    Bottomley.
    
    The physical ordering of pages delivered to the IO subsystem is strongly
    related to the order in which fragments are subdivided from larger blocks
    of memory tracked by the page allocator.
    
    Consider a single MAX_ORDER block of memory in isolation acted on by a
    sequence of order 0 allocations in an otherwise empty buddy system.
    Subdividing the block beginning at the highest addresses will yield all the
    pages of the block in reverse, and subdividing the block begining at the
    lowest addresses will yield all the pages of the block in physical address
    order.
    
    Empirical tests demonstrate this ordering is preserved, and that changing
    the order of subdivision so that the lowest page is split off first
    resolves the sglist merging difficulties encountered by driver authors at
    Adaptec and others in James Bottomley's testing.
    
    James found that before this patch, there were 40 merges out of about 32K
    segments.  Afterward, there were 24007 merges out of 19513 segments, for a
    merge rate of about 55%.  Merges of 128 segments, the maximum allowed, were
    observed afterward, where beforehand they never occurred.  It also improves
    dbench on my workstation and works fine there.

    [PATCH] vm: vfs shrinkage tuning
    
    Some people want the dentry and inode caches shrink harder, others want them
    shrunk more reluctantly.
    
    The patch adds /proc/sys/vm/vfs_cache_pressure, which tunes the vfs cache
    versus pagecache scanning pressure.
    
    - at vfs_cache_pressure=0 we don't shrink dcache and icache at all.
    
    - at vfs_cache_pressure=100 there is no change in behaviour.
    
    - at vfs_cache_pressure > 100 we reclaim dentries and inodes harder.
    
    
    The number of megabytes of slab left after a slocate.cron on my 256MB test
    box:
    
    vfs_cache_pressure=100000   33480
    vfs_cache_pressure=10000    61996
    vfs_cache_pressure=1000     104056
    vfs_cache_pressure=200      166340
    vfs_cache_pressure=100      190200
    vfs_cache_pressure=50       206168
    
    Of course, this just left more directory and inode pagecache behind instead of
    vfs cache.  Interestingly, on this machine the entire slocate run fits into
    pagecache, but not into VFS caches.

    [PATCH] vmscan.c scan rate fixes
    
    We've been futzing with the scan rates of the inactive and active lists far
    too much, and it's still not right (Anton reports interrupt-off times of over
    a second).
    
    - We have this logic in there from 2.4.early (at least) which tries to keep
      the inactive list 1/3rd the size of the active list.  Or something.
    
      I really cannot see any logic behind this, so toss it out and change the
      arithmetic in there so that all pages on both lists have equal scan rates.
    
    - Chunk the work up so we never hold interrupts off for more that 32 pages
      worth of scanning.
    
    - Make the per-zone scan-count accumulators unsigned long rather than
      atomic_t.
    
      Mainly because atomic_t's could conceivably overflow, but also because
      access to these counters is racy-by-design anyway.

    From: Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>
    
    Major rewrite of cpumask to use a single implementation, as a struct-wrapped
    bitmap.
    
    This patch leaves some 26 include/asm-*/cpumask*.h header files orphaned - to
    be removed next patch.
    
    Some nine cpumask macros for const variants and to coerce and promote between
    an unsigned long and a cpumask are obsolete.  Simple emulation wrappers are
    provided in this patch for these obsolete macros, which can be removed once
    each of the 3 archs (i386, ppc64, x86_64) using them are recoded in follow-on
    patches to not need them.
    
    The CPU_MASK_ALL macro now avoids leaving possible garbage one bits in any
    unused portion of the high word.
    
    An inproved comment lists all available operators, for convenient browsing.

    These bitmap improvements make it a suitable basis for fully supporting

    requires more than one unsigned long's worth of bits).

    and wrappers for each bitmap_<op> are exposed in include/linux/bitmap.h
    
    This patch _includes_ Bill Irwins rewrite of the bitmap_shift operators to not

    [PATCH] cpumask: make cpu_present_map real even on non-smp
    
    From: Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>
    
    This patch makes cpu_present_map a real map for all configurations, instead of
    a constant for non-SMP.  It also moves the definition of cpu_present_map out
    of kernel/cpu.c into kernel/sched.c, because cpu.c isn't compiled into non-SMP
    kernels.
    
    The pattern is that each of the possible, present and online cpu maps are
    actual kernel global cpumask_t variables, for all configurations.  They are
    documented in include/linux/cpumask.h.  Some of the UP (NR_CPUS=1) code
    cheats, and hardcodes the assumption that the single bit position of these
    maps is always set, as an optimization.

    [PATCH] rcu: avoid passing an argument to the callback function
    
    From: Dipankar Sarma <dipankar@in.ibm.com>
    
    This patch changes the call_rcu() API and avoids passing an argument to the
    callback function as suggested by Rusty.  Instead, it is assumed that the
    user has embedded the rcu head into a structure that is useful in the
    callback and the rcu_head pointer is passed to the callback.  The callback
    can use container_of() to get the pointer to its structure and work with
    it.  Together with the rcu-singly-link patch, it reduces the rcu_head size
    by 50%.  Considering that we use these in things like struct dentry and
    struct dst_entry, this is good savings in space.
    
    An example :
    
    struct my_struct {
    	struct rcu_head rcu;
    	int x;
    	int y;
    };
    
    void my_rcu_callback(struct rcu_head *head)
    {
    	struct my_struct *p = container_of(head, struct my_struct, rcu);
    	free(p);
    }
    
    void my_delete(struct my_struct *p)
    {
    	...
    	call_rcu(&p->rcu, my_rcu_callback);
    	...
    }

    [PATCH] rcu lock update: Use a sequence lock for starting batches
    
    From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
    
    Step two for reducing cacheline trashing within rcupdate.c:
    
    rcu_process_callbacks always acquires rcu_ctrlblk.state.mutex and calls
    rcu_start_batch, even if the batch is already running or already scheduled to
    run.
    
    This can be avoided with a sequence lock: A sequence lock allows to read the
    current batch number and next_pending atomically.  If next_pending is already
    set, then there is no need to acquire the global mutex.
    
    This means that for each grace period, there will be
    
    - one write access to the rcu_ctrlblk.batch cacheline
    
    - lots of read accesses to rcu_ctrlblk.batch (3-10*cpus_online()).  Behavior
      similar to the jiffies cacheline, shouldn't be a problem.
    
    - cpus_online()+1 write accesses to rcu_ctrlblk.state, all of them starting
      with spin_lock(&rcu_ctrlblk.state.mutex).
    
      For large enough cpus_online() this will be a problem, but all except two
      of the spin_lock calls only protect the rcu_cpu_mask bitmap, thus a
      hierarchical bitmap would allow to split the write accesses to multiple
      cachelines.
    
    Tested on an 8-way with reaim.  Unfortunately it probably won't help with Jack
    Steiner's 'ls' test since in this test only one cpu generates rcu entries.

    [PATCH] rcu lock update: Add per-cpu batch counter
    
    From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
    
    Below is the one of my patches from my rcu lock update.  Jack Steiner tested
    the first one on a 512p and it resolved the rcu cache line trashing.  All were
    tested on osdl with STP.
    
    Step one for reducing cacheline trashing within rcupdate.c:
    
    The current code uses the rcu_cpu_mask bitmap both for keeping track of the
    cpus that haven't gone through a quiescent state and for checking if a cpu
    should look for quiescent states.  The bitmap is frequently changed and the
    check is done by polling - together this causes cache line trashing.
    
    If it's cheaper to access a (mostly) read-only cacheline than a cacheline that
    is frequently dirtied, then it's possible to reduce the trashing by splitting
    the rcu_cpu_mask bitmap into two cachelines:
    
    The patch adds a generation counter and moves it into a separate cacheline.
    This allows to removes all accesses to rcu_cpumask (in the read-write
    cacheline) from rcu_pending and at least 50% of the accesses from
    rcu_check_quiescent_state.  rcu_pending and all but one call per cpu to
    rcu_check_quiescent_state access the read-only cacheline.  Probably not enough
    for 512p, but it's a start, just for 128 byte more memory use, without slowing
    down rcu grace periods.  Obviously the read-only cacheline is not really
    read-only: it's written once per grace period to indicate that a new grace
    period is running.
    
    Tests on an 8-way Pentium III with reaim showed some improvement:
    
    oprofile hits:
    Reference: http://khack.osdl.org/stp/293075/

    The total runtime differs between both runs, thus the % number must
    be compared: Around 50% faster. I've uninlined rcu_pending for the
    test.
    
    Tested with reaim and kernbench.
    
    Description:
    
    - per-cpu quiescbatch and qs_pending fields introduced: quiescbatch contains
      the number of the last quiescent period that the cpu has seen and qs_pending
      is set if the cpu has not yet reported the quiescent state for the current
      period.  With these two fields a cpu can test if it should report a
      quiescent state without having to look at the frequently written
      rcu_cpu_mask bitmap.
    
    - curbatch split into two fields: rcu_ctrlblk.batch.completed and
      rcu_ctrlblk.batch.cur.  This makes it possible to figure out if a grace
      period is running (completed != cur) without accessing the rcu_cpu_mask
      bitmap.
    
    - rcu_ctrlblk.maxbatch removed and replaced with a true/false next_pending
      flag: next_pending=1 means that another grace period should be started
      immediately after the end of the current period.  Previously, this was
      achieved by maxbatch: curbatch==maxbatch means don't start, curbatch!=
      maxbatch means start.  A flag improves the readability: The only possible
      values for maxbatch were curbatch and curbatch+1.
    
    - rcu_ctrlblk split into two cachelines for better performance.
    
    - common code from rcu_offline_cpu and rcu_check_quiescent_state merged into
      cpu_quiet.
    
    - rcu_offline_cpu: replace spin_lock_irq with spin_lock_bh, there are no
      accesses from irq context (and there are accesses to the spinlock with
      enabled interrupts from tasklet context).
    
    - rcu_restart_cpu introduced, s390 should call it after changing nohz:
      Theoretically the global batch counter could wrap around and end up at
      RCU_quiescbatch(cpu).  Then the cpu would not look for a quiescent state and
      rcu would lock up.

    [PATCH] jbd needs to wait for locked buffers
    
    From: Chris Mason <mason@suse.com>
    
    jbd needs to wait for any io to complete on the buffer before changing the
    end_io function.  Using set_buffer_locked means that it can change the
    end_io function while the page is in the middle of writeback, and the
    writeback bit on the page will never get cleared.
    
    Since we set the buffer dirty earlier on, if the page was previously dirty,
    pdflush or memory pressure might trigger a writepage call, which will race
    with jbd's set_buffer_locked.

    [PATCH] Allow i386 to reenable interrupts on lock contention
    
    From: Zwane Mwaikambo <zwane@linuxpower.ca>
    
    Following up on Keith's code, I adapted the i386 code to allow enabling
    interrupts during contested locks depending on previous interrupt
    enable status. Obviously there will be a text increase (only for non
    CONFIG_SPINLINE case), although it doesn't seem so bad, there will be an
    increased exit latency when we attempt a lock acquisition after spinning
    due to the extra instructions. How much this will affect performance I'm
    not sure yet as I haven't had time to micro bench.

    [PATCH] USB: Fail pending URBs in dummy_hcd upon disconnect
    
    This patch fixes another bug in the dummy_hcd driver.  When a gadget
    driver unregisters (simulating a device disconnect), dummy_hcd stops the
    timer that it uses for processing outstanding URBs.  Unfortunately this
    means that those URBs will never be given back.  The patch lets the timer
    continue running; when it expires all the remaining URBs will fail so the
    timer won't be reinitialized.

    [PATCH] USB: Add logical connect-change notices to the hub driver
    
    This patch implements the missing functionality necessary to get device
    resets working fully.  It adds a bit-array of ports with logical
    connect-changes pending to the hub structure, so that the hub driver can
    recognize that these ports should be treated as though they had
    disconnected and re-connected.  This is how we will handle devices that
    "morph" (i.e., change their descriptors) following a reset, as might
    happen with a firmware upload.
    
    There is also a lot of additional kerneldoc and a few small changes to
    some log messages.  An important restriction is that usb_reset_device()
    will refuse to work if the device is suspended.  Trying to reset a
    suspended device leads to several problems, not least of which is that the
    device's parent hub might be suspended as well.
    
    With this patch the device reset code is pretty much complete.  However it
    won't always work correctly until the device locking is straightened out.
    That's coming up next.

    [PATCH] Handle altivec assist exception properly
    
    This is the PPC64 counterpart of the PPC32 Altivec assist exception
    handler that went in recently.
    
    On PPC64 machines with Altivec (i.e.  machines that use the PPC970 chip,
    such as the G5 powermac), the altivec floating-point instructions can
    operate in two modes: one where denormalized inputs or outputs are
    truncated to zero, and one where they aren't.  In the latter mode the
    processor can take an exception when it encounters denormalized
    floating-point inputs or outputs rather than dealing with them in
    hardware.
    
    This patch adds code to deal properly with the exception, by emulating
    the instruction that caused the exception.  Previously the kernel just
    switched the altivec unit into the truncate-to-zero mode, which works
    but is a bit gross.  Fortunately there are only a limited set of altivec
    instructions which can generate the assist exception, so we don't have
    to emulate the whole altivec instruction set.
    
    Note that Altivec is Motorola's name for the PowerPC vector/SIMD
    instructions; IBM calls the same thing VMX, and currently only IBM makes
    64-bit PowerPC CPU chips.  Nevertheless, I have used the term Altivec in
    the PPC64 code for consistency with the PPC32 code.

    [PATCH] radeonfb: Fix panel detection on some laptops
    
    The code in radeonfb looking for the BIOS image currently uses the BIOS
    ROM if any, and falls back to the RAM image if not found.  This is
    unfortunatly not correct for a bunch of laptops where the real panel
    data are only present in the RAM image.
    
    This works around this problem by preferring the RAM image on mobility
    chipsets.  This is definitely not the best workaround, we need some arch
    support for linking the RAM image to the PCI ID (preferrably by having
    the arch snapshot it during boot, isolating us completely from the
    details of where this image is in memory).  I'll see how we can get such
    an improvement later.

    [libata sata_sil] Re-fix mod15write bug
    
    Certain early SATA drives have problems with write requests whose
    length satisfy the equation "sectors % 15 == 1", on the SiI 3112.
    Other drives, and other SiI controllers, are not affected.
    
    The fix for this problem is to avoid such requests, in one of three
    ways, for the affect drive+controller combos:
    1) Limit all writes to 15 sectors
    2) Use block layer features to avoid creating requests whose
       length satisfies the above equation.
    3) When a request satisfies the above equation, split the request
       into two writes, neither of which satisfies the equation.
    
    I chose fix #1, the most simple to implement.  After discussion with
    Silicon Image and others regarding the impact of this fix, I have
    decided to remain with fix #1, and will not be implementing a
    "better fix".  This means that the affected SATA drives will see
    decreased performance, but set of affected drives is small and will
    never grow larger.
    
    Further, the complexity of implementing solution #2 or
    solution #3 is rather large.
    
    When implementing lba48 'large request' support, I unintentionally
    broke the fix for these affected drives.  Kudos to Ricky Beam for
    noticing this.
    
    This change restores the fix, by adding a flag ATA_DFLAG_LOCK_SECTORS
    to indicate that the max_sectors value set by the low-level driver
    should never be changed.

    msix_capability_init() puts the offset of the MSI-X capability into

    and then tries to use pos as the offset again, which results in
    writing the MSI-X enable bit off into space.

    [PATCH] [11/18] qla2xxx: Misc. fixes
    
      Small fixes:
    
      o Remove incorrect and unused ISP2100 #define
        SS_RESIDUAL_LEN_VALID.
    
      o Fix problem where an incorrect status would be returned
        for qla2x00_configure_fabric() if the driver was unable to
        log into a fabric's SNS.
    
      o Check for the additional WAIT_FOR_AL_PA state in
        qla2x00_fw_ready() since switch vendors may push NOS/OLS
        primitives during a 'port disabled' state.

    [PATCH] [7/18]  qla2xxx: Tape command handling fixes
    
      Fix several tape handling issue:
    
      1) When the firmware receives the LOGO from the device, any
      active exchanges will be returned with a completion status
      of 0x29 -- this will cause the port to be marked as lost and
      request made to the DPC routine to begin a relogin attempt.
      The problem is, since we've never actually logged out of the
      device and cannot do so in interrupt context, we must be
      sure to perform the logout before the qla2x00_fabric_login()
      in the RELOGIN_NEEDED code.
    
      2) Sets the Get Port Database options to ZERO when issuing
      the call to qla2x00_get_port_database().  This consolidates
      actuall login handling in the place it should be, in the
      previous qla2x00_fabric_login() call rather than depending
      on any 'hidden' behaviour of the firmware.  If a device did
      a LOGO after the login, then any subsequent exachanges will
      be returned with an 0x29 completion status and the
      RELOGIN_NEEDED code will handle the login.
    
      3) Finally, if the master and slave state do not indicate a
      logged-in state from the Get Port Database call, then one
      cannot depend on the information returned from the firmware
      -- the firmware typically wipes out the PCB information for
      a given loopID when logged out.  So, return immediately with
      a failed status.

    [PATCH] [4/18]  qla2xxx: ISR RISC paused fixes
    
      Problem reported/corrected by Michael Reed [mdr@sgi.com]:
    
      We have a 2312 that puts the 8.00.00b12-k qla2xxx driver
      into an infinite loop with a solid interrupt, 0x8008,
      hcsr = 0x7430, risc status register 0x40008110,
      immediately after enabling parity on the board.
    
      It looks as though the early out test in
      qla_isr.c:qla2x00_intr_handler() against stat is broken.
      HSR_RISC_PAUSED is set.  Also, there's a stale mailbox
      completion flagged (stat&0xff) which will short circuit
      the default case in the switch if it got that far.

    Yes, it is _wrong_!   This code is baggage left behind from earlier
    drivers when we were 'asked' to work around certain applications'
    inability to properly construct commands.

    [PATCH] tmscsim: host_lock use in LLD
    
    While reviewing tmscsim, I noticed something, I didn't quite like /
    understand. The driver takes the host_lock (with irqsave) at the entry to
    the ISR, and releases it at the exit. And inside the ISR there are
    potentially long busy-waits... Like
    
     	int ctr = 6000000; /* only try for about a second */
     	while( --ctr && !((dstate = DC390_read8 (DMA_Status)) &
     				DMA_XFER_DONE) && pSRB->SGToBeXferLen );
    
    The attached patch is attempting to fix those places. Not sure if this is
    a proper fix though. In my understanding, after looking through the code,
    the host_lock is used to protect host-specific data and host-registers.
    The ->queuecommand is already called with it help, so, one just,
    basically, have to protect other contexts - interrupt, timer,... So, looks
    mostly right.

    Attached. Also fixed some __init / __devinit and __exit / __devexit
    attributes. Although, would be good to have something like
    
    #ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI
    #define __pcidevinit
    #define __pcidevinitdata
    #define __pcidevexit
    #define __pcidevexitdata
    #else
    #define __pcidevinit __init
    #define __pcidevinitdata __initdata
    #define __pcidevexit __exit
    #define __pcidevexitdata __exitdata
    #endif

    NTFS: Add a new type, ntfs_index_context, to allow retrieval of an index
          entry using the corresponding index key.  To get an index context,
          use ntfs_index_ctx_get() and to release it, use ntfs_index_ctx_put().
          This also adds a new slab cache for the index contexts.  To lookup a
          key in an index inode, use ntfs_index_lookup().  After modifying an
          index entry, call ntfs_index_entry_flush_dcache_page() followed by
          ntfs_index_entry_mark_dirty() to ensure the changes are written out
          to disk.  For details see fs/ntfs/index.[hc].  Note, at present, if
          an index entry is in the index allocation attribute rather than the
          index root attribute it will not be written out (you will get a
          warning message about discarded changes instead).

    [PCMCIA] 05-nonbusy
    
    When allocating memory and IO resources, do not mark them busy.
    This allows drivers themselves to claim and mark the regions busy,
    as they are supposed to.

    [PATCH] kbuild: add deb-pkg target
    
    To prepare kbuild for more kernel packaging formats move all packaging support
    to scripts/package.
    
    In top-level Makefile introduce generic support for all package formats using
    target names *-pkg.  Included the old rpm target for backward compatibility.
    
    A new variable KBUILD_IMAGE is used to specify what kernel image will be part
    of the final package, and is to be set by the arch specific makefile.
    KBUILD_IMAGE may be overridden from command line or environment.  KBUILD_IMAGE
    will see wider usage later, mainly when installing kernel images.
    
    Introducing KBUILD_IMAGE allowed arch specific details to be deleted from the
    mkspec and builddeb scripts.
    
    While in the process added the deb packet format.  Script is From: Wichert
    Akkerman <wichert@wiggy.net>
    
    To create a RPM packet use 'make rpm-pkg'.
    To create a deb packet use 'make deb-pkg'.
    Both targets are included in 'make help'

    allmodconfig and allyesconfig are currently failing because they select

    Firmware is usually provided in separate filer '_shipped', and there is no

    This patch three issues in NUMA API
    
    - When 1 was passed to set_mempolicy or mbind as maxnodes argument
      get_nodes could corrupt the stack and cause a crash.  Fix that.
    
    - Remove the restriction to do interleaving only for order 0.  Together
      with the patch that went in previously to use interleaving policy at boot
      time this should give back the original behaviour of distributing the big

    [PATCH] fix possible stack corruption during reiserfs_file_write
    
    With preallocation turned on, reiserfs_allocate_blocks_for_region wasn't
    sending a large enough array to hold all the blocks it was asking the block
    allocator to find.  This can result in stack corruption.
    
    The fix is to kmalloc an array to hold the blocks, making sure to allocate
    something large enough.
    
    There was also a recent optimization to force the allocator to find a free
    region large enough to hold the entire preallocation size.  This was
    sometimes causing more blocks to be allocated then had been requested,
    which would also overflow the array.  Something more elegant is required
    here, until then just disable the optimization.

    [PATCH] v4l: tuner + tda9887 updates
    
    This is a big update for the tuner and tda9887 modules which are used for TV
    card tuning.
    
    The tda9887 module is basically completely rewritten and understands all the
    config bits now instead of having just some fixed config presets.  Some of
    these config bits can be changed by insmod options now.
    
    The other big change is that both modules allow to use the V4L2 API for
    inter-module communication (i.e.  when bttv/saa7134/...  pass through the
    tuning ioctls to the modules).  That allows to specify the TV norm more
    precisely (not just PAL but PAL-I, PAL-BG, ...), which is needed in some cases
    to make TV audio work correctly.  Using the old v4l1 API is still possible so
    this shouldn't break any users of these two modules.

    [PATCH] iommu max segment size
    
    This patch is from James, I've changed it slightly only.
    
    The problem is that some IOMMU implementations have a maximum limit to the
    size of the number of contiguously mappable pages (admittedly, this limit
    is mostly in the resource management algorithms rather than the IOMMUs
    themselves).
    
    This patch adds this concept to the bio layer via the parameter
    
    BIO_VMERGE_MAX_SIZE
    
    which architectures can define in asm/io.h (if undefined, we assume it to
    be infinite, which is current behaviour).
    
    While adding this, I noticed several places where bio was making incorrect
    assumptions about virtual mergeability (none of which was a bug: bio was
    overestimating rather than underestimating).
    
    - The worst offender was bio_add_page(), which seemed never to check for
      virtual mergeability
    
    - I also fixed blk_hw_contig_segments() not to check the QUEUE_CLUSTER
      flag, and not to check the phys segment boundary.
    
    In order to track the hw segment size across bios, I had to introduce two
    extra bio parameters: bi_hw_front_size and bi_hw_back_size which store the
    sizes of the front and back hw contiguous segments (and which will be equal
    if there's only one hw segment).  When the bio is merged into a request,
    these fields are updated with the total hw contig size so they can always
    be used to assess if the merger would violate the BIO_VMERGE_MAX_SIZE
    parameter.

    [PATCH] Add ovcamchip driver
    
    This patch adds a new driver for the OmniVision OV6xx0 and OV7xx0 series of
    CMOS image sensors.  It is currently used by the w9968cf USB webcam driver,
    which is already in mainline 2.6.  Up until now it had to be compiled
    outside the kernel tree, which is clearly suboptimal.
    
    It is also used by version 2 of the ov511 USB webcam driver, which will be
    merged in the near future.  That will reduce some code duplication, since
    the existing ov511 has much of this code built-in.
    
    This was previously submitted to Linux-USB-Devel, and I have fixed the
    concerns that came up at that time.

    [PATCH] O_NOATIME support
    
    This patch adds support for the O_NOATIME open flag (GNU extension):
    
    int O_NOATIME  	Macro
      If this bit is set, read will not update the access time of the file.
      See File Times. This is used by programs that do backups, so that
      backing a file up does not count as reading it. Only the owner of the
      file or the superuser may use this bit.
    
    It is useful if you want to do something with the file atime (for instance,
    moving files that have not been accessed in a while to somewhere else, or
    something like Debian's popularity-contest) but you also want to read all
    files periodically (for instance, tripwire or debsums).
    
    Currently, the program that reads all files periodically has to use utimes,
    which can race with the atime update:
    
        A               B
      open
      fstat
      read
                      open
                      read
                      close
      close
      utimes
    
    And the file still has the old atime, instead of the new one from when B
    did the read from it.  This problem does not happen if A uses O_NOATIME
    instead of utimes to preserve the atime.
    
    This patch adds the O_NOATIME constant for all architectures, but it would
    also be possible to add it one architecture at a time by defining it to 0
    when not defined in asm-*.

    [PATCH] Permit inode & dentry hash tables to be allocated > MAX_ORDER size
    
    Here's a patch to allocate memory for big system hash tables with the
    bootmem allocator rather than with main page allocator.
    
    It is needed for three reasons:
    
    (1) So that the size can be bigger than MAX_ORDER.  IBM have done some
        testing on their big PPC64 systems (64GB of RAM) with linux-2.4 and found
        that they get better performance if the sizes of the inode cache hash,
        dentry cache hash, buffer head hash and page cache hash are increased
        beyond MAX_ORDER (order 11).
    
         Now the main allocator can't allocate anything larger than MAX_ORDER, but
         the bootmem allocator can.
    
         In 2.6 it appears that only the inode and dentry hashes remain of those
         four, but there are other hash tables that could use this service.
    
    (2) Changing MAX_ORDER appears to have a number of effects beyond just
        limiting the maximum size that can be allocated in one go.
    
    (3) Should someone want a hash table in which each bucket isn't a power of
        two in size, memory will be wasted as the chunk of memory allocated will
        be a power of two in size (to hold a power of two number of buckets).
    
        On the other hand, using the bootmem allocator means the allocation
        will only take up sufficient pages to hold it, rather than the next power
        of two up.
    
        Admittedly, this point doesn't apply to the dentry and inode hashes,
        but it might to another hash table that might want to use this service.
    
    
    I've coelesced the meat of the inode and dentry allocation routines into
    one such routine in mm/page_alloc.c that the the respective initialisation
    functions now call before mem_init() is called.
    
    This routine gets it's approximation of memory size by counting up the
    ZONE_NORMAL and ZONE_DMA pages (and ZONE_HIGHMEM if requested) in all the
    nodes passed to the main allocator by paging_init() (or wherever the arch
    does it).  It does not use max_low_pfn as that doesn't seem to be available
    on all archs, and it doesn't use num_physpages since that includes highmem
    pages not available to the kernel for allocating data structures upon -
    which may not be appropriate when calculating hash table size.
    
    On the off chance that the size of each hash bucket may not be exactly a
    power of two, the routine will only allocate as many pages as is necessary
    to ensure that the number of buckets is exactly a power of two, rather than
    allocating the smallest power-of-two sized chunk of memory that will hold
    the same array of buckets.
    
    The maximum size of any single hash table is given by
    MAX_SYS_HASH_TABLE_ORDER, as is now defined in linux/mmzone.h.

    [PATCH] export DMI check functions
    
    This patch creates and exports 2 functions which can be used by the rest of
    kernel code to perform DMI data checks:
    
    - dmi_check_system() function checks system DMI data against given blacklist
      table and on each match runs corresponding callback function;
    
    - dmi_get_system_info() function returns DMI data value.  Useful for people
      wanting more complex DMI data check than simple string match.
    
    Also filling unused match entries with NO_MATCH made optional, but existing
    NO_MATCH occurences are left intact, so people are free to continue dmi_scan.c
    patching without massive reject problems.

    [PATCH] FAT: don't use "utf8" charset and NLS_DEFAULT
    
    Recently, some distributors have set "utf8" to NLS_DEFAULT, therefore,
    FAT uses the "iocharset=utf8" as default.  But, since "iocharset=utf8"
    doesn't provide the function (lower <-> upper conversion) which FAT
    needs, so FAT can't provide suitable behavior.
    
    This patch does:
    
         - doesn't recognize "utf8" as "iocharset"
         - doesn't use NLS_DEFAULT as default "iocharset"
         - instead of NLS_DEFAULT, adds FAT_DEFAULT_CODEPAGE and
           FAT_DEFAULT_IOCHARSET
    
    NOTE: the following looks like buggy, so it's not recommended
    
        "codepage=437,iocharset=iso8859-1,utf8"
    
    however, some utf8 file name can handle. (in this case, it uses the
    table of iso8859-1 for lower <-> upper conversion)

    copy of these (sys_start, sys_stop) in a slightly different
    form.

    [PCMCIA] 02-validatemem
    
    Move validate_mem() so we don't recurse.  We call this function from
    the DS_GET_FIRST_TUPLE and DS_VALIDATE_CIS calls, which are the the
    first two functions which may be called by cardmgr or cardctl which
    require CIS access.

    [PATCH] sis900-fix-phy-transceiver-detection.patch
    
    From: Daniele Venzano <webvenza@libero.it>
    
    Fix PHY transceiver detection code to fall back to known PHY and not to the
    last detected.
    
    The code checks every transceiver detected for link status and type, but fails
    when ghost transceivers are detected, deciding to use the last one detected.
    
    With this patch the driver should choose the correct transceiver even when
    some ghosts are detected by checking for the type of the tranceiver it is
    going to use.

    [PATCH] natsemi updates
    
    - support for external phys, both fibre and twisted pair, added:
          * remove the "phy" parameter from mdio_{read,write}: the
            function accesses the current phy.
          * new functions to access external phys: miiport_{read,write}
          * scan for external phys on _probe.
          * ethtool support for switching between internal
            and external phys.
          * introduce an init_phy_fixup helper: a few settings must be
            reapplied after reenabling the internal phy.
    - move register_netdev to the end of _probe. The current position
    could cause races with hotplug.
    - do not wait for autonegotiation completed after initialization.
    - use pci_name() instead of dev->name until register_netdev has
    initialized dev->name.
    - read the BMSR register in the link beat interrupt twice:
    The link status field is latched, without reading twice a link up
    event will be missed (and only noticed a few seconds later in the
    media timer)
    - restart the autonegotiation after modifying the capabilities.

    [PATCH] pcnet32: recover after rx hang.
    
    This patch fixes a receive hang that occasionally occurs after a Tx
    FIFO underrun.  The receive dma remains in a hung state sometimes.  The
    transmit operations continue to occur, but no receive activity.
    
    This was reproduced on several ppc64 systems and the fix has been verified
    there.  The patch has been tested as well on an ia32 system, which did
    not experience the hang because it did not have fifo underruns, which is
    a preqrequisite for the hang.  The memory barriers decreased the frequency
    of occurrence.  The final change to reset the chip instead of just stopping
    it eliminated the last hangs.
    
    Please also apply against 2.4.7 (with offset of -1), tested ia32.

    Allows translation of shared memory addresses for devices using

    from the ARM DMA address, for example with some USB OHCI
    controllers.
    
    For more background information, please see the ARM Linux mailing

    Patch from Nicolas Pitre
    
    Let's make it coherent with what the actual code is doing and has
    always done, even in 2.4.  Nobody complained about this so let's
    just fix the comment.  The most natural usage pattern for this is
    a base address and a size so it's more efficient to have an exclusive
    end address anyway.

    This cset adds the code to handle the hardware vector floating point

    an implementation for the common cases, and bounces exceptions for
    other cases, which have to be handled in software, and signalling
    SIGFPE as appropriate.

    [PATCH] ipr abort hang fix
    
    The following patch fixes a hang that occurs when an abort
    is issued by the midlayer. The hang is the result of overriding
    a field in the union of the ipr_cmd struct. It is fixed by moving
    this pointer outside of the union, since it is not mutually exclusive
    with the other fields in the union.

    [PKT_SCHED]: Add loss option to network delay scheduler.
    
    This enhances the network simulation scheduler to do simple random loss.
    
    The loss parameter is a simple 32 bit value such that 0 means no loss, and
    0xffffffff is always drop.  I have a new version of the tc command which takes
    care of conversion from percent to this value.

    [PATCH] sparse: drivers/message/fusion annotations and fixes
    
    Sigh...  First of all, LSI folks have very quaint idea of existing
    platforms and word sizes on those.  Their definitions of U32 and S32
    should really be reserved for posterity (preferably chiseled into the
    rock they have between the ears), but kernel is the wrong place for
    that.  Fixed.
    
    mptctl_do_mpt_command() was always called on userland pointers;
    kernel/userland argument removed along with dead code, function
    annotated, callers updated.
    
    The rest is trivial annotations in mptctl.c and in its ioctl structures
    - nothing fancy there.

    [PATCH] crapectomy - last users of kernel_scsi_ioctl() gone
    
    Last 3 users of kernel_scsi_ioctl() eliminated; two of them used to read
    partition table by issuing a READ6 via ioctl (instead of just calling
    scsi_bios_ptable() as every other ->biosparam() instance does).
    
    The last one was doing a very quaint access to fields of scsi_device by
    issuing SCSI_IOCLT_GET_LUN and then shuffling bits in the result.  Down
    with that insanity...

    [PATCH] SCSI whitelist changes
    
    The BLIST_REPORTLUN2 blacklist item has exactly the behavior that
    the MYLEX DACARMRB (and SGI TP9100, which is really a 2Gb upgrade
    to the DACARMRB) need.
    
    These devices use a PQ of 1 instead of 3 for unconfigured luns,
    which means that every RAID has 32 luns, many or most of which
    are just phantoms.
    
    However, it does support Report Luns, and it returns the correct
    data.

    [PATCH] SCSI Flexible timout intfrastructure
    
    The object of this infrastructure is to give HBAs early warning that
    error handling is about to happen and also provide them with the
    opportunity to do something about it.
    
    It introduces the extra template callback:
    
    eh_timed_out()
    
    which scsi_times_out() will call if it is populated to notify the LLD
    that an outstanding command took a timeout.
    
    There are three possible returns:
    
    EH_HANDLED:	I've fixed the problem, please complete the command for me
    (as soon as the timer fires, scsi_done will do nothing, so the timer
    itself will call a special version of scsi_done that doesn't check the
    timer).
    
    EH_NOT_HANDLED:	Invoke error recovery as normal
    
    EH_RESET_TIMER:	The command will complete, reset the timer to its
    original value and start it ticking again.

    This patch for the dummy_hcd driver prevents it from rejecting SET-ADDRESS
    requests when the address is already set.  The USB 2.0 spec states that if
    a device is in the ADDRESS state, it should accept and start using the new
    address.  Behavior in the CONFIGURED state is undefined, but since
    dummy_hcd doesn't keep track of the difference between the two states we
    might as well accept the new address in any case.

    [PATCH] cfq direct io alias problem
    
    This is a fix for when we encounter an alias during insert. When that
    happens we move the request to dispatch, but it may happen that this
    request is also the ->last_merge hint. So we may attempt to merge with
    this later, when it's either in progress or already freed. Rearrange the
    logic a bit so we clear the merge hint there as well. It looks more
    complex than it is, the only real code change is the addition of a
    cfq_remove_merge_hints() in cfq_dispatch_sort().

    [PATCH] RLIM: enforce rlimits on queued signals
    
    Add a user_struct pointer to the sigqueue structure.  Charge sigqueue
    allocation and destruction to the user_struct rather than a global pool.  This
    per user rlimit accounting obsoletes the global queued_signals accouting.
    
    The patch as charges the sigqueue struct allocation to the queue that it's
    pending on (the receiver of the signal).  So the owner of the queue is charged
    for whoever writes to it (much like quota for a 777 file).
    
    The patch started out charging the task which allocated the sigqueue struct.
    In most cases, these are always the same user (permission for sending a
    signal), so those cases are moot.  In the cases where it isn't the same user,
    it's a privileged user sending a signal to another user.
    
    It seems wrong to charge the allocation to the privleged user, when the other
    user could block receipt as long as it feels.  The flipside is, someone else
    can fill your queue (expectation is that someone else is privileged).  I think
    it's right the way it is.  The change to revert is very small.

    is necessary to ensure signals generated out of process context can be charged
    to the correct user.

    [PATCH] Hugetlb page bug fix for i386 in PAE mode
    
    Hit a bug check when unmap a hugetlb vma in PAE mode on i386 (and x86-64).
    
     Bad page state at free_hot_cold_page (in process 'a.out', page c165cc40)

    It turns out there is a bug in hugetlb_prefault(): with 3 level page table,
    huge_pte_alloc() might return a pmd that points to a PTE page.  It happens
    if the virtual address for hugetlb mmap is recycled from previously used
    normal page mmap.  free_pgtables() might not scrub the pmd entry on munmap
    and hugetlb_prefault skips on any pmd presence regardless what type it is.
    Patch to fix the bug.

    [PATCH] IPMI base patch to fix channel handling and add polling
    
    This patch fixes some problems with handling of channel detection in the
    driver.  Some systems that are IPMI 1.5 do not implement the channel query
    command.  Also, the interface has to be fully up before the command is
    ready.
    
    This patch also adds a polling interface; this is required for situations
    where interrupts are not running, but the system must still issue IPMI
    commands, like when taking a crash dump.
    
    It also updates the driver version to v32.

    [PATCH] Updates to rivafb driver
    
    The patch updates rivafb to the following:
    
    1.  Fixed cursor corruption and simplified cursor code.
    
    2.  Maximized var->yres_virtual on initial mode setting.  Scrolling,
       therefore, defaults to y-panning which is significantly faster.
    
    3.  Restricted var->xres_virtual and var->yres_virtual to 0x7fff
       (hardware limitation?).  Otherwise, var->yres_virtual > 0x7fff + panning
       will hang the GPU.
    
    4.  Added I2C/DDC support.  This feature enables independent mode setup
       to rivafb.  'stty rows n cols n' should now work correctly.  This is a
       configurable option.
    
    5. Various/minor fixes to drawing code.

    The fsx-linux hole fill failure problem was caused by

    _all_ values for loops_per_jiffy and for certain {n,u}delay()s for many
    loops_per_jiffy values.
    
    Assuming
    
    LPJ = 1501115
    
    udelay(87)
    
    results in
    
    130597 loops to be spent.
    
    However, 1000 * 130597 / 1501115 is 86.999997 us, so we're actually
    _rounding down_.  1000 * 130598 / 1501115 is 87.000662841, which would be
    the technically correct thing to do.  Of course, for the TSC case this
    won't matter as the maths take some time, so the actual delay is
    
    1000 * __udelay(x) / lpj + __OVERHEAD(x)
    
    Anybody worried about both the additional overhead and the fact that the
    overhead takes some time to run should add a check
    
            if (unlikely(xloops < OVERHEAD))
                    return;
            xloops -= OVERHEAD;
    
    to the delay() routines in arch/i386/kernel/timers/*.c and determine
    what the OVERHEAD is.

    [PATCH] round up  in __udelay()
    
    Round up in __udelay(): 2**32 / 100000 is 4294.97, so it's more intuitive
    to round up, and it causes more predictable results:
    
    n usec delay on a 1500000 BogoMIPS system:
    
      n 	   before	  -mull		after
      1	 1000 ticks	 1499 ticks	 1500 ticks
     10	14000 ticks	14999 ticks	15000 ticks
    
    n usec delay on a 100000 BogoMIPS system:
    
     n 	   before	  -mull		after
      1	    0 ticks	   99 ticks	  100 ticks
     10	    0 ticks	  999 ticks	 1000 ticks
    100	 9000 ticks	 9999 ticks	10000 ticks
    
    While it can be argued that some time is also spent in the delay functions,
    it's better to spend _at least_ the specified time sleeping, in my humble
    opinion.  And the overhead of a specific ->delay() implementation should be
    substracted in the specific ->delay() implementation.

    [PATCH] mull'ify multiplication with HZ in __const_udelay()
    
    John Stultz mentioned on lkml ( http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/6/5/15 ) that
    calls to udelay() don't delay long enough, causing trouble e.g.  in the USB
    subsystem.  The following patches address this issue.
    
    Move the multiplication of (loops_per_jiffy * xloops) with HZ into the
    "mull" asm operation.  This increases the accuracy of the delay functions
    largely:
    
    n usec delay on a system with loops_per_jiffy = 1500000 :
    
      n 	   before	  after
      1	 1000 ticks	 1499 ticks
     10	14000 ticks	14999 ticks
    
    n usec delay on a system with loops_per_jiffy = 100000 :
    
     n 	   before	  after
      1	    0 ticks	   99 ticks
     10	    0 ticks	  999 ticks
    100	 9000 ticks	 9999 ticks
    
    As noted by Kurt Garloff, it's necessary to adjust for large
    loops_per_jiffies, as the multiplication of it with HZ fails for 4GHz or
    larger.  So, John Stultz suggested multiplying xloops with 4 first, and
    multiplying with (HZ/4).

    There has been for some time a problem with certain CD-ROMs whose images

    that in certain catalogue entries, the extension separator character '/'
    (RISC OS uses '.' and '/' the other way round) was not replaced with '.';
    thus Linux cannot properly parse this without this patch, thinking that it
    is a directory separator.

     * Fixed argument processing bug in init/main.c (Eric Delaunay)
    This fixes Debian BTS #58566.

    	From: Eric Delaunay <delaunay@lix.polytechnique.fr>
    	Message-Id: <200002201918.UAA02327@jazz.pontchartrain.fr>
    	Subject: pb in handling parameters on kernel command line
    	To: submit@bugs.debian.org (debian bug tracking system)
    
    Hello, I found some bugs in kernel command line parser.  AFAIK, they are not
    Debian nor sparc specific but I'm not subscribed to linux-kernel mailing list
    and since I'm involved with boot-floppies (mainly for sparc), I think I'm right
    to report it here.  Feel free to forward it upstream (I checked the latest
    2.3.46 sources and it seems these bugs are still there).
    
    These bugs are not release critical.  The latter just not gives the user a
    chance to overwrite TERM env var at boot time.  It could be just
    inconvenient for serial console boot, and in this case, our busybox' init is
    already enforcing TERM=vt102.
    Nevertheless if it could not be fixed before the release, I could even write a
    workaround in busybox' init (it's just a matter of rewriting getenv()).
    
    At last, it does not affect sysvinit package because serial console tty is
    controlled by a getty process which is reading terminal settings on its command
    line (take a look in inittab for T0 entries, if any).
    
    Ok, here is my modest contribution to kernel hacking.  I don't know much about
    kernel internals but it seems that argument parsing is a bit broken.
    
    One trivial patch for command line like "init=/bin/sh console=prom" where
    console=prom is replaced by lot of spaces in previous call to setup_arch() on
    sparc, therefore the line parsed by parse_options() is really
    "init=/bin/sh            " and a lot of null args are pushed into argv_init.
    
    The other patch is for command line like "TERM=vt100" where both default & user
    TERM entries are pushed into the env array.
    Taking a look into /proc/1/environ, it shows up:
    HOME=/
    TERM=linux
    TERM=vt100
    
    It appears that ash (maybe other shells too) is giving the latter entry but
    glibc getenv() is giving the former.  It is therefore impossible to get entry
    from the user in a C program like busybox' init (used in Debian boot-floppies).
    
    I guess getenv() is not written to support duplicate entries, therefore the
    kernel should avoid such construct.

    [PATCH] Shift+PgUp if nr of scrolled lines is < 4
    
    Using the vga console driver, if the number of the lines scrolled out is
    less than four, then Shift+PageUp doesn't work.
    
    The bug is closely related to the 'margin' feature of scrolling, which
    means that if less than four lines should remain unvisible in the direction
    we are scrolling to, then we scroll a little bit more just to see those few
    lines.  Kind of two small magnets at the borders of the buffer.
    
    This bug was also reported with maybe a less clear description by Stepan
    Koltsov (cc'ed just for fun) back in 2001 and he got no answer.  I found it
    at http://seclists.org/lists/linux-kernel/2001/Nov/0080.html
    
    His patch simply disables margin support and hence everythings becomes
    okay, but you lose a nice feature.
    
    Here's a patch that retains margin support and fixes the bug.  Works for
    me, tested for a week.  No guarantee.  As I don't fully understand the code
    (see also my previous mail) I'm not 100% sure that I'm doing the right
    thing, so I'd prefer if someone would take a closer look at it.
    
    At least 2.4 and 2.6 are affected, maybe older ones too.

    [PATCH] epoll: replace the file lookup hash with rbtrees
    
    The epoll allocation for the fd lookup hash used to allocate up to 1MB
    (depending on the "hint" size passed to epoll_create()) with
    __get_free_pages(0), and this might lead to a "malicious" user to do
    something like:
    
        for (i = 0; i < 1024; i++)
            epoll_create(BIG-NUM);
    
    You can replace "malicious user" with IBM-ltp test suite, and the meaning
    does not change.  The above code might exhaust memory badly, even before
    the file creation limit is topped.  Also, the allocation was independent
    from the number of fds pushed into the epoll fd hash.  Using an rb-tree
    ther will be not pre-allocation of the hash, and the size of the memory
    used will be proportional to the number of fds pushed into the epoll fd.
    The patch also removes 100 lines of code, that is never a bad thing ;)

    [PATCH] blk: move threshold unplugging
    
    The 'unplug on queued exceeding unplug threshold' logic only works for file
    system requests currently, since it's in __make_request().  Move it where
    it belongs, in elv_add_request().  This way it works for queued block sg
    requests as well.

    [PATCH] cciss ioctl32 update
    
    This patch provides a conversion routine for 32-bit user space apps that
    call into a 64-bit kernel on x86_64 architectures.  This is required for
    the HP Array Configuration utility and the HP management agents.  Without
    this patch the apps will not function.
    
    The 2 ioctls affected are the cciss pass thru ioctls.  Caveat: it spits out
    2 warnings during compilation.  I've tried everything I can think of to
    clean them up, but...  If anyone has any helpful suggestions I'm all ears.

    [PATCH] sys_getdents64 needs compat wrapper
    
    Due to different structure alignment rules in the ABI between ia32 and
    ia64, certain members of the dirent structure are not guaranteed to be 8
    byte aligned on ia64.  This requires a compat wrapper around these 32 bit
    system calls.  Other architectures may or may not have the problem,
    depending on the alignment rules.
    
    This was observed by running /emul/ia32-linux/bin/ls on 2.6.6 which produces
    kernel mode unaligned faults.

    [PATCH] Use numa policy API for boot time policy
    
    Suggested by Manfred Spraul.
    
    __get_free_pages had a hack to do node interleaving allocation at boot
    time.  This patch sets an interleave process policy using the NUMA API for
    init and the idle threads instead.  Before entering the user space init the
    policy is reset to default again.  Result is the same.
    
    Advantage is less code and removing of a check from a fast path.
    
    Removes more code than it adds.
    
    I verified that the memory distribution after boot is roughly the same.

    [PATCH] apic: remove marking of non-present physids in phys_cpu_present_map
    
    Marking invalid APIC ID's in phys_cpu_present_map was intended to generate
    "collisions" between APIC ID's in order to assist the ordinary bounds
    checking against the broadcast physical APIC ID.  However, this is bounds
    checked everywhere it's necessary, and it's also not even possible to
    properly bounds-check everywhere.  So this patch removes that marking of
    non-present physical APIC ID's.

    [PATCH] APIC enumeration fixes
    
    The following patch appears sound according to an audit to ensure that all
    of the codepaths where it was introduced were called after the APIC
    fixmappings were set up.
    
    This patch introduces get_physical_broadcast(), which checks the version ID
    of the local APIC to determine whether it's a serial APIC or xAPIC, and
    returns the correct physical broadcast ID.  It replaces all uses of
    APIC_BROADCAST_ID and IO_APIC_MAX_ID with this in order to ensure.  It also
    changes the checks during MP table parsing so the APIC ID is checked in
    tandem with the version number.
    
    I'm holding out for some kind of testing to get an idea of whether this
    covers the cases or introduces regressions, or whatever.

    [PATCH] 3c59x: support for ATI Radeon 9100 IGP
    
    The following patch adds support for the 3Com networking core found in the
    ATI Radeon 9100 IGP southbridge used on boards like Asus P4R800-VM.
    
    The main point of this patch is using HAS_MII instead of HAS_NWAY for the
    definition of the board.  All the previous trials since the end of last
    year used HAS_NWAY which disables the Tx part of the transceiver; using
    HAS_NWAY was the way all 3Com Cyclone and Tornado chips worked, as they had
    the transceiver integrated.  The ATI solution has an external transceiver
    and I had to physically see the different chip on the board (the board was
    provided by ATI) to finally understand that it needs the HAS_MII
    definition...  I'm still waiting for some docs from ATI to clarify if this
    is the correct way of handling this chip and if there are any differences
    w.r.t EEPROM handling, but as it appears to work and was also confirmed by
    other testers, I don't want to keep owners of such boards away from their
    networks :-)
    
    The textual identification was a bit hard to decide; it's called
    "3c920B-EMB-WNM" in the Windows .INF file that Asus provides for their
    boards.  As this name was already used for PCI ID 9210, I added the
    paranthesis which specifies where this chip is found.
    
    The Scyld driver defines FEATURE_TORNADO to include HAS_NWAY.  This board
    would then probably need to not be defined with FEATURE_TORNADO, but the
    same as in this patch.
    
    I would like to publicly thank Tyson Vickers for both ideas and patience
    during the last few weeks.  He managed to get the driver working by
    randomly setting driver parameters :-) But then he contacted me and worked
    with me towards the solution.

    [PATCH] sisfb update 1.7.10
    
    attached is an update for the sisfb driver to version 1.7.10.
    
    This update includes
    
    - fixes for pure 64bit and 32/64bit mixed systems (add ioctl conversion;
      fix variable sizes, etc; REQUIRED for current X.org/XFree86 on 64bit
      systems, even if pure 64bit),
    
    - fixes for 301C video bridge, (scales TV output correctly now)
    
    - fixes for 1600x1200 and 1400x1050 LCD panels,
    
    - many fixes for 661/741/760 (amongst others, proper LFB support for the
      760 and corrections for SiS' new BIOS data layout; would lead to display
      corruption with old driver)
    
    - add support for many modes for LCD which were unsupported previously,
    
    - add support for HiVision and YPbPr HDTV
    
    - "vga=" statement now honoured properly (sisfb will set the same mode as
      the kernel did by default)
    
    - use LCD native resolution mode if no mode is given
    
    - a major clean up of main driver code,
    
    - radical removal of duplicate (or nearly duplicate) code,
    
    - switched to 2.6 module_param macros,
    
    - enhanced communication with the X driver,
    
    - added eventual POSTing of SiS300/305 card for non-x86 archs,
    
    - added ability to relocate the image on the TV screen using a userland
      tool,
    
    - added Documentation/fb/sisfb.txt (why the heck was this missing?!)
    
    - small fix for SiS DRM driver (match 32/64bit fixes mentioned above)
      (cast the data passed to sis_free as u32)
    
    - make driver re-entrant by avoiding static structures and variables.
    
    As usual, heavily tested.  The mode switching code is even lab-tested by
    SiS (although 100% written by me).  Please apply asap (especially since
    64bit systems were not properly supported previously; as mentioned, current
    X.org/XFree86 needs this update for proper communication with the
    framebuffer driver on 64bit systems.  X crashes on such systems with the
    old driver).

    [PATCH] iso9660: fix handling of inodes beyond 4GB
    
    This is my fourth attempt to patch the isofs code.  It is similar to the last
    posting except this one implements the NFS get_parent() method which has
    always been missing.
    
    The original problem I set out to addresses is that the current iso9660 file
    system cannot reach inodes located beyond the 4GB barrier.  This is caused by
    using the inode number as the byte offset of the inode data.  Being 32-bits
    wide, the inode number is unable to reach inode data that does not reside on
    the first 4GB of the file system.
    
    This causes real problems with "growisofs"
    
          http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/linux/DVD+RW/#isofs4gb
    
    and my pet project "shunt"
    
          http://www.serice.net/shunt/
    
    This patch switches the isofs code from iget() to iget5_locked() which allows
    extra data to be passed into isofs_read_inode() so that inode data anywhere on
    the disk can be reached.
    
    The inode number scheme was also changed.  Continuing to use the byte offset
    would have resulted in non-unique inodes in many common situations, but
    because the inode number no longer plays any role in reading the meta-data off
    the disk, I was free to set the inode number to some unique characteristic of
    the file.  I have chosen to use the block offset which is also 32-bits wide.
    
    Lastly, the pre-patch code uses the default export_operations to handle
    accessing the file system through NFS.  The problem with this is that the
    default NFS operations assume that iget() works which is no longer the case
    because of the necessity of switching to iget5_locked().  So, I had to
    implement the NFS operations too.  As a bonus, I went ahead and implemented
    the NFS get_parent() method which has always been missing.

    [PATCH] BSD accounting format rework
    
    BSD accounting format rework:
    
    Use all explicit and implicit padding in struct acct to
    
     - correctly report 32 bit uid/gid,
     - correctly report jobs (e.g., daemons) running longer than 497 days,
     - increase the precision of ac_etime from 2^-13 to 2^-20
       (i.e., from ~6 hours to ~1 min. after a year)
     - store the current AHZ value.
     - allow cross-platform processing of the accounting file
       (limited for m68k which has a different size struct acct).
     - introduce versioning for smooth transition to incompatible formats in
       the future. Currently the following version numbers are defined:
         0: old format (until 2.6.7) with 16 bit uid/gid
         1: extended variant (binary compatible to v0 on M68K)
         2: extended variant (binary compatible to v0 on everything except M68K)
         3: a new binary incompatible format (64 bytes)
         4: new binary incompatible format (128 bytes).
            layout of its first 64 bytes is the same as for v3.
         5: marks second half of new binary incompatible format (128 bytes)
            (layout is not yet defined)
    
    All this is accomplished without breaking binary compatibility.  32 bit
    uid/gid support is compatible with the patch previously floating around and
    used e.g.  by Red Hat.
    
    This patch also introduces a config option for a new, binary incompatible
    "version 3" format that
    
     - is uniform across and properly aligned on all platforms
     - stores pid and ppid
     - uses AHZ==100 on all platforms (allows to report longer times)
    
    Much of the compatibility glue goes away when v1/v2 support is removed from
    the kernel.  Such a patch is at
    
      http://www.physik3.uni-rostock.de/tim/kernel/2.7/acct-cleanup-04.patch
    
    and might be applied in the 2.7 timeframe.
    
    The new v3 format is source compatible with current GNU acct tools (6.3.5).
    However, current GNU acct tools can be compiled for only one format.  As there
    is no way to pass the kernel configuration to userspace, with my patch it will
    still only support the old v2 format.  Only if v1/v2 support is removed from
    the kernel, recompiling GNU acct tools will yield v3 support.
    
    A preliminary take at the corresponding work on cross-platform userspace tools
    (GNU acct package) is at
    
      http://www.physik3.uni-rostock.de/tim/kernel/utils/acct/
    
    This version of the package is able to read any of the v0/v2/v3 formats,
    regardless of byte-order (untested), even within the same file.
    Cross-platform compatibility with m68k (v1 format) is not yet implemented, but
    native use on m68k should work (untested).  pid and ppid are currently only
    shown by the dump-acct utility.
    
    Thanks to Arthur Corliss, Albert Cahalan and Ragnar Kjørstad for their
    comments, and to Albert Cahalan for the u64->IEEE float conversion code.

    [PATCH] Validate PM-Timer rate at boot time
    
    Add a check to the PM-Timer initialization code.  It validates the PM-Timer
    rate against PIT channel 2 and rejects the PM-Timer if its rate is not
    withing 5% of the expected number.
    
    Rationale:
    
    The PMTMR timers of certain (older) mainboards are running at invalid
    rates, often much faster than the rate expected by the PM-Timer code.  This
    causes the system clock to run much too fast.  See also
    http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2375
    
    Possible workarounds are disabling the PM-Timer in the kernel config or
    disabling the PM-Timer at boot time through the "clock=tsc" parameter.
    However, we believe it is more user friendly to automatically validate the
    PM-Timer rate at boot time before using it as the system time source.
    
    Tested by me (with broken timer) and John Stultz (with good timer) and
    believed to be ok.

    io_apic_sync() was introduced in 2.1.104 and it was originally done for

    and clearly since the lack of io_apic_sync() didnt break some of the other
    writes we do to the IO-APIC registers, it must be unnecessary in the
    masking case too.

    If a second thread runs truncate and shrinks i_size, so isize1 and isize2 are
    different, the read can return up to a page of zero-fill that shouldn't really
    exist.
    
    The trick is to read isize1 after doing the readpage.  I realised this is the
    right way to do it without having to change the readpage API.

    [PATCH] small tweaks to standard resource stuff
    
    Various small tweaks. Compiled and booted.
    
    1. add IORESOURCE_BUSY | IORESOURCE_MEM also for the kernel code and
         data resources. I don't believe this actually matters one bit, but
         they're hooked into a BUSY/MEM parent ("System RAM") and marking
         them busy seems to make sense.
    
    2. delete the .start = 1M default for the kernel code resource. This
         isn't actually a change; it's set to virt_to_phys(_text) in

    [PATCH] Use first-fit for pty allocation
    
    (With Andrew Morton).
    
    The current dynamic pty allocation scheme has a few problems:
    
    - pty numbers grow to be very large, causing wtmp file bloat.
    
    - Seems to break libc5 and some old applications
    
    So change it to do first-fit.  An IDR tree is used to provide a
    logarithmic-time search.

    [PATCH] Ext3: Retry allocation after transaction commit (v2)
    
    Here is a reworked version of my patch to ext3 to retry certain filesystem
    operations after an ENOSPC error.  The ext3_should_retry_alloc() function will
    not wait on the currently running transaction if there is a currently active
    handle; hence this should avoid deadlocks in the Lustre use case.  The patch
    is versus BK-recent.
    
    I've also included a simple, reliable test case which demonstrates the problem
    this patch is intended to fix.  (Note that BK-recent is not sufficient to
    address this test case, and waiting on the commiting transaction in
    ext3_new_block is also not sufficient.  Been there, tried that, didn't work.
    We need to do the full-bore retry from the top level.  The
    ext3_should_retry_alloc() will only wait on the committing transaction if
    there is an active handle; hence Lustre will probably also need to use
    ext3_should_retry_alloc() if it wants to reliably avoid this particular
    problem.)

    [PATCH] pc9800: merge std_resources.c back into setup.c
    
    std_resources.{c,h} was only split off due to pc9800 wanting to override it.
    With it gone, it might as well be merged back in.  Doesn't change any code.
    It was compiled and booted.
    
    This time this also actually doesn't break compilation of any of the
    subarches.  That's to say, any further.  I guess it might have been my .config
    (my regular PC config, with just the subarch switched through menuconfig) or
    O=, but only ELAN actually compiled.  Voyager and VISWS bombed out at the

    [PATCH] IDR fixups
    
    There were definately some problems in there.  I've made some changes and
    tested with a lot of bounds.  I don't have a machine with enough memory to
    fill it up (it would take ~16GB on a 64-bit machine), but I use the "above"
    code to simulate a lot of situations.
    
    The problems were:
    
        * IDR_FULL was not the right value
        * idr_get_new_above() was not defined in the headers or documented.
        * idr_alloc() bug-ed if there was a race and not enough memory was
          allocated.  It should have returned NULL.
        * id will overflow when you go past the end.
        * There was a "(id >= (1 << (layers*IDR_BITS)))" comparison, but at
          the top layer it would overflow the id and be zero.
        * The allocation should return ENOSPC for an "above" value with
          nothing above it, but it returned EAGAIN.
    
    I have not tested on 64-bits (as I don't have a 64-bit machine).
    
    I've included the files, a diff from the previous version, and my test
    programs.
    
    For the test programs, idr_test <size> will just attempt to allocate
    <size> elements, check them, free them, and check them again.
    
    idr_test2 <size> <incr> will allocate <size> element with <incr> between
    them.
    
    idr_test3 just tests some bounds and tries all values with just a few in
    the idr.

    [PATCH] idr: remove counter bits from id's
    
    idr_get_new() currently returns an incrementing counter in the top 8 bits of
    the counter.  Which means that most users have to mask it off again, and we
    only have a 24-bit range.
    
    So remove that counter.  Also:
    
    - Remove the BITS_PER_INT define due to namespace collision risk.
    
    - Make MAX_ID_SHIFT 31, so counters have a 0 to 2G-1 range.
    
    - Why is MAX_ID_SHIFT using sizeof(int) and not sizeof(long)?  If it's for
      consistency across 32- and 64-bit machines, why not just make it "31"?
    
    - Does this still hold true with the counter removed?
    
    /* We can only use half the bits in the top level because there are
       only four possible bits in the top level (5 bits * 4 levels = 25
       bits, but you only use 24 bits in the id). */
    
      If not, what needs to change?

    [PATCH] Fixes for idr code
    
    * On a 32-bit architecture, the idr code will cease to work if you add
      more than 2^20 entries.  You will not be able to find many of the
      entries.  The problem is that the IDR code uses 5-bit chunks of the
      number and the lower portion used by IDR is 24 bits, so you have one bit
      that leaks over into the comparisons that should not be there.  The
      solution is to mask off that bit before doing IDR processing.  This
      actually causes the POSIX timer code to crash if you create that many
      timers.  I have included an idr_test.tar.gz file that demonstrates this
      with and without the fix, in case you need more evidence :).
    
    * When the IDR fills up, it returns -1.  However, there was no way to
      check for this condition.  This patch adds the ability to check for the
      idr being full and fixes all the users.  It also fixes a problem in
      fs/super.c where the idr code wasn't checking for -1.
    
    * There was a race condition creating POSIX timers.  The timer was added
      to a task struct for another process then the data for the timer was
      filled out.  The other task could use/destroy time timer as soon as it is
      in the task's queue and the lock is released.  This moves settup up the
      timer data to before the timer is enqueued or (for some data) into the
      lock.
    
    * Change things so that the caller doesn't need to run idr_full() to find
      out the reason for an idr_get_new() failure.
    
      Just return -ENOSPC if the tree was full, or -EAGAIN if the caller needs
      to re-run idr_pre_get() and try again.

    reiserfsck --rebuild-tree expects the only key with a packing locality of 1 to

    [PATCH] reiserfs: block allocator optimizations
    
    From: <mason@suse.com>
    From: <jeffm@suse.com>
    
    The current reiserfs allocator pretty much allocates things sequentially
    from the start of the disk, it works very nicely for desktop loads but
    once you've got more then one proc doing io data files can fragment badly.
    
    One obvious solution is something like ext2's bitmap groups, which puts
    file data into different areas of the disk based on which subdirectory
    they are in.  The problem with bitmap groups is that if you've got a
    group of subdirectories their contents will be spread out all over the
    disk, leading to lots of seeks during a sequential read.
    
    This allocator patch uses the packing locality to determine which bitmap
    group to allocate from, but when you create a file it looks in the bitmaps
    to see how 'full' that packing locality already is.  If it hasn't been
    heavily used yet, the packing locality is inherited from the parent
    directory putting files in new subdirs close to the parent subdir,
    otherwise it is the inode number of the parent directory putting new
    files far away from the parent subdir.
    
    The end result is fewer bitmap groups for the same working set.  For
    example, one test data set created by 20 procs running in parallel has
    6822 subdirs.  And with vanilla reiserfs that would mean 6822
    packing localities.  This patch turns that into 26 packing localities.
    
    This makes sequential reads of big directory trees more efficient, but
    it also makes the btree more efficient in general.  Things end up sorted
    better because groups of subdirs end up with similar keys in the btree,
    instead of being spread out all over.
    
    The bitmap grouping code tries to use the start of each bitmap group
    for metadata, and offsets the data slightly.  The data and metadata
    are still close together, but not completely intermixed like they are
    in the default allocator.  The end result is that leaf nodes tend to be
    close to each other, making metadata readahead more effective.
    
    The old block allocator had the ability to enforce a minimum
    allocation size, but did not use it.  It now tries to do a pass looking
    for larger allocation chunks before falling back to the old behaviour
    of taking any blocks it can find.
    
    The patch changes the defaults to:
    
    mount -o alloc=skip_busy:dirid_groups:packing_groups
    
    You can get back the old behaviour with mount -o alloc=skip_busy
    
    mount -o alloc=dirid_groups will turn on the bitmap groups
    mount -o alloc=packing_groups turns on the packing locality reduction code
    mount -o alloc=skip_busy:dirid_groups turns on both dirid_groups and
    skip_busy
    
    Finally the patch adds a mount -o alloc=oid_groups, which puts files into
    bitmap groups based on a hash of their objectid.  This would be used for
    databases or other situations where you have a limited number of very
    large files.
    
    This command will tell you how many packing localities are actually in
    use:
    
    debugreiserfs -d /dev/xxx | grep '^|.*SD' | sed 's/^.....//' | awk '{print $1}' | sort -u | wc -l

    [PATCH] binfmt_misc: improve calculation of interpreter's credentials
    
    This patch allows for misc binaries to run with credentials and security
    token that are calculated according to the binaries, and not according to the
    interpreter, which is the legacy behavior of binfmt_misc.
    
    The way it is done is by calling prepare_binprm, which is where these
    attributes are calculated, before switching the 'file' field in the bprm from
    the binary to the interpreter.
    
    This feature should be used with care, since the interpreter will have root
    permissions when running a setuid binary owned by root.
    
    Please note -
    
    - Only root can register an interpreter with binfmt_misc.  The feature is
      documented and the administrator is advised to handle it with care
    
    - The new feature is enabled only with a special flag in the registration
      string.  When this flag is not specified the current behavior of
      binfmt_misc is kept
    
    - This is the only 'right' way for an interpreter to know the correct
      AT_SECURE value for the interpreted binary
    
    
    From: Chris Wright <chrisw@osdl.org>
    
      This patchset looks OK, except for one problem.  It installs the fd (which
      could've been unreadable) without unsharing the ->files.  So someone can use
      this to read unreadable yet executable files.  Here's a patch which fixes
      that up.  I added one bit that's commented out because I'm not positive if a
      final steal_locks() is needed.
    
      I did a fair amount of rearranging to simplify the error conditions
      relative to the fd_install(), and unshare_files().
    
    From: Chris Wright <chrisw@osdl.org>
    
      I found that the intel patchset (and mine as well) leaked i_writecount on
      the original executed file.  In addition, I verified that the steal_locks()
      bit is indeed needed.

    [PATCH] Handle non-readable binfmt_misc executables
    
    <background>
    
    I work in a group that works on enabling the IA-32 Execution Layer
    (http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20040113comp.htm) on Linux.
    In a few words - this is a dynamic translator for IA-32 binaries on IPF
    platform.  Following David Mosberger's advice - we use the binfmt_misc
    mechanism for the invocation of the translator whenever the user tries to
    exec an IA-32 binary.
    
    The EL is meant to help in the migration path from IA-32 to IPF.  From our
    beta customers we learnt that at first stage - they tend to keep their
    environment mostly intact, using the legacy IA-32 binaries.
    
    Such an environment has, naturally, setuid and non-readable binaries.  It
    will be useless to ask the administrator to change the settings of such an
    environment - some of them are very complex, and the administrators are
    reluctant to make any changes in a system that already proved itself to be
    robust and secure.  So, our target with these patches is not to enhance the
    support for scripts but rather to allow a translator to be integrated into a
    working environment that is not (and should not be) aware to the fact it's
    being emulated.
    
    As I said before - it is practically hopeless to expect an administrator of
    such a system to change it so that it will suit the current behavior of
    binfmt_misc.  But, even if we could do that,
    
    I'm not sure it would be a good idea - these changes are likely to be less
    secure than the suggested patches -
    
    - In order to execute non-readable binaries the binary will have to be made
      readable, which is obviously less secure than allowing only a trusted
      translator to read it
    
    - There will be no way for the translator to calculate the accurate
      AT_SECURE value for the translated process.  This might end up with the
      translated process running in a non-secured mode when it actually needs to
      be secured.
    
    </background>
    
    
    I prepared a patch that solves a couple of problems that interpreters have
    when invoked via binfmt_misc.  currently -
    
    1) such interpreters cannot open non-readable binaries
    
    2) the processes will have their credentials and security attributes
       calculated according to interpreter permissions and not those of the
       original binary
    
    the proposed patch solves these problems by -
    
    1) opening the binary on behalf of the interpreter and passing its fd
       instead of the path as argv[1] to the interpreter
    
    2) calling prepare_binprm with the file struct of the binary and not the
       one of the interpreter
    
    The new functionality is enabled by adding a special flag to the registration
    string.  If this flag is not added then old behavior is not changed.
    
    A preliminary version of this patch was sent to the list on 9/1/2003 with the
    title "[PATCH]: non-readable binaries - binfmt_misc 2.6.0-test4".  This new
    version fixes the concerns that were raised by the patch, except of calling
    unshare_files() before allocating a new fd.  this is because this feature did
    not enter 2.6 yet.
    
    
    Arun Sharma <arun.sharma@intel.com> says:
    
    We were going through an internal review of this patch:
    
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107424598901720&w=2
    
    which is in your tree already.  I'm not sure if this line of code got
    sufficient review.
    
    +               /* call prepare_binprm before switching to interpreter's file
    +                * so that all security calculation will be done according to
    +                * binary and not interpreter */
    +               retval = prepare_binprm(bprm);
    
    The case that concerns me is: unprivileged interpreter and a privileged
    binary.  One can use binfmt_misc to execute untrusted code (interpreter) with
    elevated privileges.  One could argue that all binfmt_misc interpreters are
    trusted, because only root can register them.  But that's a change from the
    traditional behavior of binfmt_misc (and binfmt_script).
    
    
    (Update):
    
    Arun pointed out that calculating the process credentials according to the
    binary that needs to be translated is a bit risky, since it requires the
    administrator to pay extra attention not to register an interpreter which is
    not intended to run with root credentials.
    
    After discussing this issue with him, I would like to propose a modified
    patch: The old patch did 2 things - 1) open the binary for reading and 2)
    calculate the credentials according to the binary.
    
    I removed the riskier part of changing the credentials calculation, so the
    revised patch only opens the binary for reading.  It also includes few words
    of warning in the description of the 'open-binary' feature in
    binfmt_misc.txt, and makes the function entry_status print the flags in use.
    
    As for the 'credentials' part of the patch, I will prepare a separate patch
    for it and send it again to the LKML, describe the problem and ask for people
    comments.

    [PATCH] mm: flush TLB when clearing young
    
    Traditionally we've not flushed TLB after clearing the young/referenced bit,
    it has seemed just a waste of time.  Russell King points out that on some
    architectures, with the move from 2.4 mm sweeping to 2.6 rmap, this may be a
    serious omission: very frequently referenced pages never re-marked young, and
    the worst choices made for unmapping.
    
    So, replace ptep_test_and_clear_young by ptep_clear_flush_young throughout
    rmap.c.  Originally I'd imagined making some kind of TLB gather optimization,
    but don't see what now: whether worth it rather depends on how common
    cross-cpu flushes are, and whether global or not.
    
    ppc and ppc64 have already found this issue, and worked around it by arranging
    TLB flush from their ptep_test_and_clear_young: with the aid of pgtable rmap
    pointers.  I'm hoping ptep_clear_flush_young will allow ppc and ppc64 to
    remove that special code, but won't change them myself.
    
    It's worth noting that it is Andrea's anon_vma rmap which makes the vma
    available for ptep_clear_flush_young in page_referenced_one: anonmm and
    pte_chains would both need an additional find_vma for that.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Optimize exception/syscall entry/exit
    
    This rewrites the PPC64 exception entry/exit routines to make them
    smaller and faster.
    
    In particular we no longer save all of the registers for the common
    exceptions - system calls, hardware interrupts and decrementer (timer)
    interrupts - only the volatile registers.  The other registers are saved
    and restored (if used) by the C functions we call.  This involved
    changing the registers we use in early exception processing from r20-r23
    to r9-r12, which ended up changing quite a lot of code in head.S.
    Overall this gives us about a 20% reduction in null syscall time.
    
    Some system calls need all the registers (e.g.  fork/clone/vfork and
    [rt_]sigsuspend).  For these the syscall dispatch code calls a stub that
    saves the nonvolatile registers before calling the real handler.
    
    This also implements the force_successful_syscall_return() thing for
    ppc64.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Implement CONFIG_PREEMPT
    
    This implements CONFIG_PREEMPT for ppc64.  Aside from the entry.S
    changes to check the _TIF_NEED_RESCHED bit when returning from an
    exception, there are various changes to make the ppc64-specific code
    preempt-safe, mostly adding preempt_enable/disable or get_cpu/put_cpu
    calls where needed.  I have been using this on my desktop G5 for the
    last week without problems.

    [PATCH] ia64: switching between CPEI & CPEP
    
    A couple of months ago Hidetoshi Seto from Fujitsu proposed
    a patch to provide similar switching between interrupt mode
    and polling mode for corrected platform events (CPE) as we
    have for processor events (CMC) [with the obvious difference
    that not all platforms support an interrupt for CPE].
    
    I dusted it off and made a couple of very minor cleanups (which
    Seto-san checked out last night on his test setup and confirmed
    still passes).

    [PATCH] USB: Only process ports with change events pending
    
    This patch adds a bit-array to the hub driver's private data structure,
    used for storing the contents of the hub's interrupt status message.  That
    message indicates which ports have events pending (and whether the hub
    itself has events pending).  By only polling the status of the ports
    listed in the bit-array we can save a fair amount of overhead in hub
    communication.
    
    (The #error test added to hub.h is a little awkward, but it's purely
    precautionary -- it won't matter until someone decides to support hubs
    with more than 31 ports!)
    
    Also included in the patch, since this seemed the perfect opportunity for
    it, is Byron's suggestion for handling hub events in the order in which
    they were received.

    [ACPI] Fix a lockup which Sid Boyce <sboyce@blueyonder.co.uk>
    discovered with IOAPIC disabled.
    
    The problem was that drivers/serial/8250_acpi.c found COM1 in the ACPI
    namespace and called acpi_register_gsi() to set up its IRQ.  ACPI tells us
    that the COM1 IRQ is edge triggered, active high, but acpi_register_gsi()
    was ignoring the edge_level argument, so it blindly set the COM1 IRQ to be
    level-triggered.

    [NET]: Clear dev refs in dst->child.
    
    This is a resend of an earlier patch to dst_dev_event.  I've changed
    it slightly by moving the input/output assignment into dst_ifdown.
    
    To recap, this patch drops lingering IPsec references to a device that
    is being unregistered.  The child processing in the GC is too late
    since it never runs until the reference on the dst hits zero which
    could take a long time for things like TCP connections.
    
    The reason I've left the input/output assignment outside the loop is
    because they aren't really necessary for the IPsec dst's, and if
    it were in the loop then we'll have to do the same child processing
    in ___dst_free as well.
    
    I've tested this with an ESP/IPCOMP tunnel and I can confirm that it
    does fix the problem.

    [ARM PATCH] 1928/1: lh7a40x #7 Changes to memory model to support contiguous SDRAM
    
    Patch from Marc Singer
    
    [if's replaced by ifdef's.]
    
    While the BLOB boot loader doesn't support it, there are two others,
    UBOOT and Logic's LOLO, that will initialize the SDRAM controller such
    that the memory appears as a contiguous region.  This layout to be
    required for WinCE and, thus, is the default for these loaders.  The
    memory organization had been optimized for discontiguous blocks.  Now,
    it supports a default mode that is compatible with all of the
    bootloaders as well as options to optimize for either contiguous or
    discontiguous models.
    
    Withing, there is also a slight change to the way that the DEBUG_LL
    macros select the UART address.  Now it uses immediate constants
    exclusively.

    [ARM PATCH] 1926/3:  PXAFB cleanups and fixes
    
    Patch from Ian Campbell
    
    Sorry, 1926/2 was missing a brace. Fixed here.
    
    Previous commentry:
    I have corrected the grayscale conversion to correctly use the upper
    byte rather than the lower one. As requested I have also left the
    actual grayscale conversion where it was this time and just dealt with
    the palette differences in pxafb_setpalettereg.
    
    fb_alloc_cmap is only called when bits_per_pixel is < 16, otherwise
    any existing cmap is freed.
    
    I also fixed up all the spaces and brackets issues (not just the one
    you raised previously) this introduces some noise in the patch, if
    you'd like the two patches separately please ask.

    [ARM] Add clock API
    
    Since peripheral clocks are be derived in SoC or even platform
    specific ways, we need a way to keep this information out of the
    drivers.  AMBA Primecells are defined in terms of functional units
    where clocks are derived from external sources, and it is up to the
    SoC designer to determine where to derive those clocks from.
    
    Therefore, we provide a very basic API which allows platforms to
    provide this information in a generic manner to their peripherals.
    This framework also allows peripherals to shut down unused clock
    sources when they're not in use.

    NTFS: - Add new element itype.index.collation_rule to the ntfs inode
            structure and set it appropriately in ntfs_read_locked_inode().
          - Implement a new inode type "index" to allow efficient access to the
            indices found in various system files and adapt inode handling
            accordingly (fs/ntfs/inode.[hc]).  An index inode is essentially an
            attribute inode (NInoAttr() is true) with an attribute type of
            AT_INDEX_ALLOCATION.  As such, it is no longer allowed to call
            ntfs_attr_iget() with an attribute type of AT_INDEX_ALLOCATION as
            there would be no way to distinguish between normal attribute inodes
            and index inodes.  The function to obtain an index inode is
            ntfs_index_iget() and it uses the helper function
            ntfs_read_locked_index_inode().  Note, we do not overload
            ntfs_attr_iget() as indices consist of multiple attributes so using
            ntfs_attr_iget() to obtain an index inode would be confusing.

    [libata] PCI IDE command-end/irq-acknowledge cleanup
    
    Restruct default irq handler (used for many PCI IDE-like SATA
    controllers) to obtain device status and acknowledge interrupts
    a bit differently.
    
    In an attempt to better attack the "ich5 screaming interrupt" problem,
    acknowledge and clear the device's INTRQ by reading the Status register
    _before_ ack'ing the controller's irq status.  This is a deviation
    from how the Linux IDE driver acknowledges interrupts, but it may
    be the best method, since the ICH5 appears to continue to assert
    the interrupt bit in the BMDMA until the device INTRQ line is cleared.
    
    Of course, SATA has no INTRQ line per se, so ICH5 essentially has
    new interrupt behavior not seen before in the PCI IDE world, while
    pretending that it's compatible with PCI IDE.  Sigh.
    
    This change affects all SATA controllers (for which there are libata
    drivers) except for sata_promise and sata_sx4.

    [libata] PCI IDE DMA code shuffling
    
    PCI IDE DMA standard (or "bmdma") helper routines ata_bmdma_stop,
    ata_bmdma_ack_irq, and ata_bmdma_status are added to linux/libata.h,
    and used in libata-core.
    
    There is a minor behavior change, such that, the Alt Status register
    is read before acknowledging the bmdma interrupt.  This should be ok,
    and furthermore there will be more significant behavior changes
    in this area coming soon.

    [libata] don't probe from workqueue
    
    Since we want the probe phase to call other workqueues, this is
    required to eliminate future deadlocks.
    
    Other methods would include starting a single-shot thread just for
    probing, but overall, using a separate thread for probing is pointless
    since we are already in process context when we probe.
    
    So, we simply call ata_bus_probe directly.

    JFS: Don't allow reading beyond the inode map's EOF
    
    If we try to read inodes that are beyond the size of the inode map,
    __read_metapages would read unitialized pages into the inode map's
    address space.  If the inode map is later grown in order to allocate
    more inodes, the page is initialized and written under a different
    address space.  Having the stale page in the page cache prevents the
    properly initialized page from being read, and results in errors.
    
    This problem can be provoked by an nfs client trying to read an inode
    that does not exist.

    [PATCH] USB: Remove private khubd semaphore
    
    This patch removes the private semaphore used by the hub driver, and uses
    the regular "serialize" semaphore instead.  This will satisfy the general
    locking requirements for adding and removing devices attached to the hub.
    The only tricky aspect is that now the hub event handler must take a
    reference to the hub device while waiting to acquire the semaphore, in
    case the hub is disconnected during the wait.
    
    The patch also replaces a few occurrences of spin_lock_irqsave() in
    regions where interrupts are known to be enabled with spin_lock_irq().

    [PATCH] USB Storage: Fix race when removing the SCSI host
    
    This patch fixes a race is disconnecting a usb-storage device that occurs
    with the SCSI layer.  It's primarily reproducable via adding delays into
    various disconnect and reset processing paths, but has also been
    encountered in the field.
    
    This patch started life as as281b, and was modified by me only to patch
    properly against current kernels.
    
    The main features of the patch are:
    
    	Store the host pointer at the start of the control thread
    	rather than trying to get it from srb->device; after the host
    	is removed the SCSI device structure may no longer exist.
    
    	Keep dev_semaphore locked during the entire time the control
    	thread or reset handlers are using the us_data structure.
    
    	Reorder the items in dissociate_dev() and release_resources()
    	so that things are released in the opposite order from the way
    	they were acquired originally.  Don't bother to increment and
    	decrement the usb_device's reference count; it's unnecessary.
    
    	In disconnect(), first set the DISCONNECTING flag so that no
    	more I/O will take place and no more requests will be accepted.
    	Next, cut short the current command and wait for it to finish.
    	Then call scsi_remove_host().  The SCSI core guarantees that
    	when scsi_remove_host() returns, the host will not be in error
    	recovery and all outstanding commands will have been cancelled.
    
    	Remove some old useless left-over code that was #if'ed out.
    
    	Use a wait_queue for the 6-second delay during device resets
    	so that we can be woken up in the middle if a disconnect occurs.
    
    The key point here is that after scsi_remove_host(), everything is idle as
    far as the SCSI midlayer is concerned.  But if there was a command in
    progress at the time, the midlayer will abort it without telling us or
    waiting for it to complete.  Hence we have to wait for the control thread
    to be idle before we can try to kill it.  This should happen quickly,
    since all I/O attempted by the thread will fail immediately.

    [PATCH] USB Storage: INQUIRY fixup, mode-sense options, Genesys devices
    
    This patch does a few things (all in the same section of code).  It started
    life as patches as226b, as280, and as275.  Later it was merged into as226e
    and I added significantly to it.
    
    
    First, this patch introduces a new config option to allow people to enable
    write-protect detection for their USB devices.  With some luck, we've
    finally got it right and can eventually remove this option in favor of
    enabling this behavior all the time.
    
    Next, we change how we force some flags on -- it turns out that there are
    some 'generic' entries in the SCSI devinfo which was overriding us when we
    didn't want it.
    
    Finally, we add a safety check to the workaround for GeneSys Logic devices
    -- if the max_sectors parameter has already been turned down, we won't turn
    it up.

    [PATCH] sysfs: fs/sysfs/inode.c: modify parents ctime and mtime on creation
    
    When a node is added to sysfs (e.g. a device plugged in via USB), the
    filesystem fails to make this change visible in the parent directory's
    ctime/mtime. This is in contrast to removing a device, because in that
    case, sysfs makes use of the function simple_unlink from fs/libfs.c which
    takes care of that. Instead of using simple_link from fs/libfs.c on
    creation, sysfs implements its own mechanism. This patch hooks into the
    function sysfs_create and sets the ctime and the mtime of the parent to
    CURRENT_TIME.

    [PATCH] PCI Hotplug: rpaphp.patch -- multi-function devices not handled correctly
    
    I made changes to rpaphp code, so it can handle multi-fuction
    devices correctly. The problem is that the pci_dev field of slot struct
    can only record one pci_dev of  the devices of a multi-fuction card.  I
    changed pci_dev (a single pci_dev type pointer) to pci_funcs( a list of
    pci_dev type pointers). I  rewrote some of the config/unconfig code to
    support  the slot struct change.
    
    Along with above changes,  I added LDRSLOT(logical I/O slot) support.
    We need LDRSLOT support for DLPAR I/O.  A card in a LDRSLOT can't be
    physically removed, but can be logically removed  from one partiton and
    reassinged to another partition.
    
    I also merged rpaphp changes from ames tree.

    [PATCH] PCI: clarify pci.txt wrt IRQ allocation
    
    I think we should make it explicit that PCI IRQs shouldn't be relied

        ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.7-rc3/2.6.7-rc3-mm1/broken-out/bk-acpi.patch
    
    does PCI interrupt routing (based on ACPI _PRT) and IRQ allocation
    at pci_enable_device()-time.
    
    (To avoid breaking things in 2.6, the above patch still allocates
    all PCI IRQs in pci_acpi_init(), before any drivers are initialized.
    But that shouldn't be needed by correct drivers, and I'd like to
    remove it in 2.7.)

    [PATCH] USB: Mark devices as NOTATTACHED as soon as possible
    
    This patch implements something we've been lacking for a long time: a way
    to mark devices as USB_STATE_NOTATTACHED as soon as we know that they're
    gone.  The usb_device->state member is no longer protected by the
    ->serialize semaphore; instead there's a new private spinlock.  Usbcore
    routines should no longer set ->state directly; instead they should use
    the new utility routine usb_set_device_state().  There are protections
    against changing states while devices are being added or removed.
    
    	Change assignments to udev->state into calls of
    	usb_set_device_state().
    
    	Add new private device_state_lock to the hub driver, along
    	with usb_set_device_state() and recursively_mark_NOTATTACHED().
    
    	Acquire the new spinlock while adding or removing children[]
    	pointers.
    
    	When disabling a port that has a child device, mark the child
    	as NOTATTACHED.
    
    You mentioned once having tried to do something like this and running into
    trouble.  Take a good look and let me know if you see any difficulties
    here.

    [PATCH] fealnx-mac-address-and-other-issues.patch
    
    (resend - I need to get this out of my tree my one means or another..)
    
    
    From: "SuD (Alex)" <sud@latinsud.com>
    
    I recently was given a surecom 10/100 ethernet card and found that i could
    not change Mac address for it as other driver/devices allow.  I tried to
    implement the missing feature and noticed that the device is quite peculiar
    (or either my system is broken), when trying to fill mac address registers
    (no matter whether io_ops is set): - If I write a byte (writeb) to an even
    i/o address it seems like actually a word was written (the next byte is set
    to 0).  - If I write a byte to an odd i/o address my pc gets bad freezed.
    
    That made think of writing 16bit words (writew) for the memory address, as
    opposed to what most driver examples do.  It works for me (I hope i set the
    lines at the right place in device_open function after the device is
    reset).  I hope the code is clean enough and does not mess with byte
    ordering.  This is the patch (this time against 2.6.5):
    
    (akpm: Is this right on big-endian?)

    [PATCH] ia64: fix race in fsys_bubble_down to avoid fp-register corruption
    
    The fast system-call fall-back-path has a race: it reads PSR, modifies
    some bits, then writes back the new PSR.  Unfortunately, the contents
    of PSR may change between reading and writing it.  For example, an
    interrupt could occur which could trigger a context-switch.  The
    context-switch might in turn flush the floating-point-high (FPH)
    partition to memory, clear PSR.MFH, and set PSR.DFH.  To prevent this
    race, the patch below turns off PSR.I before reading PSR.
    
    This fixes a floating-point corruption problem that was observed on a
    system with a libc which has the fast system-call support enabled.
    
    The performance impact is minimal (on the order of a handful of cycles).

    [PATCH] ia64: mark non-existent NUMA-nodes as offline
    
    I found a problem with HP NUMA configuration in 2.6.7-rc3-mm1.  The
    node_online_map is incorrect because of actions taken by
    reassign_cpu_only_nodes in arch/ia64/mm/discontig.c.  The mm1 patch
    which changes the mempolicy for the init_task uses this invalid
    node_online_map and eventually uses a non-existent node's zonelist
    when calling __alloc_pages.
    
    The patch below takes care of this issue.  It puts the non-existent
    nodes offline.

    [PATCH] USB: Minor tidying up of hub driver
    
    After my last few changesets there were a few small items that needed to
    be tidied up.
    
    	Update kerneldoc to reflect the actual operation of
    	usb_disconnect() and usb_new_device().  The new locking
    	requirements are listed too, though they aren't all
    	implemented yet.
    
    	Fulfill the new locking requirement in hcd_panic().
    
    	Remove unneeded local variables to conserve stack space in
    	usb_disconnect(), which calls itself recursively.
    
    	In hub_port_connect_change(), store the parent's children[]
    	pointer as late as possible and don't lock the new device until
    	then (that's when it becomes globally accessible).  This will
    	minimize the time that the not-fully-configured device structure
    	is visible to other parts of the kernel.

    [PATCH] USB: Fix bus-list root-hub race
    
    There are a few places where the code enumerates through all the USB
    devices on all the buses, starting with each bus's root hub and working
    down.  However a bus does not always have a root hub, and the code does
    not check that the root_hub pointer is non-NULL.  This patch fixes the
    problem, using the usb_bus_list_lock semaphore to synchronize access when
    root hubs are added or removed.
    
    In addition it seemed like a good idea to minimize the time that a
    non-fully-configured root hub is accessible through the bus's pointer.  So
    this patch delays setting the pointer and holds usb_bus_list_lock while
    configuring a root hub.
    
    It turned out that a bunch of things needed to be changed for all this to
    work:
    
    	Check for NULL root_hub pointer in usb_device_read() and
    	usb_find_device().
    
    	Pass the root-hub device as a separate argument to
    	hcd_register_root().
    
    	Make usb_register_root_hub() acquire the usb_bus_list_lock and
    	set the bus->root_hub pointer.
    
    	For consistency's sake, move the place where the children[]
    	pointer to a non-root-hub device gets stored as close as possible
    	to where usb_new_device() is called.
    
    	Make usb_disconnect() acquire the usb_bus_list_lock when removing
    	a root hub.
    
    	Change usb_hcd_pci_remove() and the non-PCI host drivers so that
    	they call usb_disconnect() with a pointer to the bus's root_hub
    	pointer, not a pointer to a temporary variable.
    
    	Change all the host controller drivers not to store the root_hub
    	pointer in the bus structure but instead to pass it as a new
    	argument to hcd_register_root().
    
    I made some attempt to update the hc_sl811 driver along with the rest, but
    it's pretty clear that driver won't work in the current framework.  Among
    other things, it never reads the root hub's device descriptor.  To what
    extent is the driver really supported?

    This patch adds management of platform device resources to the
    device model, allowing drivers to lookup resources, IRQs and DMA
    numbers in the platform device resource array.  We also add a
    couple of functions which allow platform devices and their resources
    to be registered.

    [PATCH] Add cpu hotplug support to cpuid.c
    
    Here is the patch that uses a cpu hotplug callback, to allow dynamic support
    of cpu id for classes in sysfs.
    
    This patch applies on top of the one I sent out earlier that Greg included.
    I do not have access to hardware that supports cpu hotswapping (virtually or not)
    so have not been able to test that aspect of the patch. However, the original
    functionality of listing static cpu's still works.
    
    Please consider for testing or inclusion.

    [PATCH] USB: rndis (1/4) update OID support
    
    NDIS devices have a generic attribute get/set API where the attributes
    are identified by 32 bit "OIDs".  This fixes some problems with the OIDs
    supported by the original RNDIS patch:
    
      - It included OIDs not found in the RNDIS spec.  These have been
        removed.  As a rule, these weren't exported in the "OIDs I support"
        list, and only a couple wouldn't fail those accesses, so this mostly
        changes what debug printk appears.
    
      - OIDs used for optional 802.3 statistics were partially supported.
        They're all in the OID list now, but the support is #ifdeffed out.
        (Those statistics were mostly just made up, anyway!)
    
      - "Required" OIDs for suspend, resume, and wakeup support weren't
        listed.  Their messages are now defined, but support is #ifdeffed
        out.  Seems the docs aren't entirely accurate, and Windows can
        behave reasonably without them.  (This area needs help from someone
        who knows MS-Windows power management.)
    
    There are also a few minor cleanups, more reasonable default volume level
    for debug messages (never at KERN_INFO, keepalives only if VERBOSE), and
    dumping of all bytes of some undocumented messages Windows XP has been
    seen emitting shortly before the host suspended itself.

    [PATCH] USB: Fix resource leakage in the hub driver
    
    The hub driver is very careless about returning resources when an error
    occurs while installing a new device.  This patch attempts to put some
    order back into the situation.  Details:
    
    	Since usb_new_device() allocates neither the device structure
    	nor the device address, it shouldn't release either one.
    
    	Because usb_new_device() no longer releases the device structure,
    	usb_register_root_hub() doesn't need to take an extra reference
    	to it.
    
    	Since the device address selection and TT setup code is used
    	only for new devices, not ones being reset, move that code from
    	hub_port_init() to hub_port_connect_change().  By the same token,
    	hub_port_init() doesn't have to release the device address or
    	the device structure.
    
    	Just to make things look better, move the failure code in
    	hub_port_init() to the end of the routine.  And when disabling
    	endpoint 0, disable both the IN and OUT parts of the endpoint.
    
    	In hub_port_connect_change(), make all the failure paths
    	execute the same code so that resources are always released.
    	These resources comprise: the pointer from the parent to the
    	new child device, the HCD state for ep0, the device's address,
    	and the device structure itself -- in short, everything that's
    	set up before calling usb_new_device().

    [PATCH] ia64: fix ia32 virtual memory leaks due to partial-page mappings
    
    Certain IA-32 applications which do mmap/munmaps which are not
    PAGE_SIZE aligned could see temporary (recovered at process exit time)
    memory leaks, because the kernel didn't have enough data to decide if
    the complete page could be unmapped. This patch adds a new data
    structure called the "partial page list" which helps the kernel keep
    track of precisely which 4k pages are in use by the IA-32 application.
    
    Armed with this data, the kernel can make better decisions at munmap
    and mprotect time. No significant performance degradation was observed
    in the workloads we tested and in some cases, the performance actually
    improved!  This is possibly due to the reduced length of the vma list.

    Ok, here you are! :)
    Attached is a patch for linux-2.6.7-rc2. (though the patch hasn't changed
    since -rc1)
    
    Again a short description:
    (the patch removes most of the changes done in linux-2.6.2)
    1. Removed the local buffer of cyberjack_write, because something goes wrong
    upon a write-request bigger than the buffer. Without this, a write-request
    stalls with error -3.
    2. Removed some usb_clear_halt() lines. Without this, the device doesn't even
    open and returns -7.
    
    It works for my cyberjack pinpad USB card reader on
    - nforce2 chipset
    - VIA KM266 chipset
    - AMD Irongate chipset

    [PATCH] Module section offsets in /sys/module
    
    So here I am trying to write about how one can apply gdb to a running
    kernel, and I'd like to tell people how to debug loadable modules.  Only
    with the 2.6 module loader, there's no way to find out where the various
    sections in the module image ended up, so you can't do much.  This patch
    attempts to fix that by adding a "sections" subdirectory to every module's
    entry in /sys/module; each attribute in that directory associates a
    beginning address with the section name.  Those attributes can be used by a
    a simple script to generate an add-symbol-file command for gdb, something
    like:
    
    #!/bin/bash
    #
    # gdbline module image
    #
    # Outputs an add-symbol-file line suitable for pasting into gdb to examine
    # a loaded module.
    #
    cd /sys/module/$1/sections
    echo -n add-symbol-file $2 `/bin/cat .text`
    
    for section in .[a-z]* *; do
        if [ $section != ".text" ]; then
    	echo  " \\"
    	echo -n "	-s" $section `/bin/cat $section`
        fi
    done
    echo
    
    Currently, this feature is absent if CONFIG_KALLSYMS is not set.  I do
    wonder if CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO might not be a better choice, now that I think
    about it.  Section names are unmunged, so "ls -a" is needed to see most of
    them.

    [PATCH] USB: Genuine changes to hub_port_debounce()
    
    This patch includes the algorithmic changes I would like to see in
    hub_port_debounce().  They are:
    
    	Increase the total timeout period from 400 ms to 1500 ms.
    
    	Check the port's connect-changed status during the polling
    	loop.
    
    	Return as soon as the connection has been stable for the
    	required time, even if it has been stably _dis_-connected.
    	(The current code waits for the full timeout period if there
    	isn't a connection.)
    
    In previous emails I have responded to all the concerns raised by others
    about these changes, and I can't imagine how they could cause any trouble.
    
    	Increasing the total timeout won't affect people with properly
    	functioning hardware.  Their connections will quickly stabilize
    	and the routine will return just as before.  People with flaky
    	hardware that takes a long time to settle down will now be able
    	to use their devices.
    
    	Checking the connect-changed status during the polling loop will
    	make the test more conservative.  The code will be able to
    	detect transient disconnections that it would have missed
    	before, and it won't return until the connection really _is_
    	stable.  Furthermore, this makes the test compliant with the
    	USB specification, which requires the stability timer to be
    	restarted whenever a connection change occurs.
    
    	Returning early for disconnections is a simple optimization.
    	It's more important now that the total timeout length is 1.5
    	seconds rather than 0.4 seconds.
    
    I urge you to apply this patch and for people to try it out.  If there do
    turn out to be problems... the patch is very small, well-contained, and
    easy to revert.

    [PATCH] USB: Superficial improvements to hub_port_debounce()
    
    Since my previous suggestions for changes to hub_port_debounce()
    encountered so much resistance, this patch makes some fairly superficial
    improvements to the code while leaving the logic of the algorithm almost
    completely intact.  The only behavioral change is that it actually
    requests the port status at the start, rather than assuming the status is
    not CONNECTED.  Changes include:
    
    	Vastly improved comments that are now unambiguous and accurately
    	descriptive of the code.
    
    	Local variables changed to more sensible names.  The stability
    	period is now reported in milliseconds rather than a meaningless
    	poll count.
    
    	The sleep interval is moved from the start of the loop to the
    	end, so that the first time through we read the port status
    	immediately.
    
    	If the connection has not stabilized after the total timeout
    	expires, -ETIMEDOUT is returned rather than whatever the
    	current connect status happens to be.
    
    	If the connection does stabilize then the port status is returned
    	so that hub_port_connect_change() will have an up-to-date value
    	for the status rather than relying on the pre-debounce value.
    
    The changes I wanted to make but other people were worried about are
    included as comments.  A later (small) patch will uncomment them for
    testing.

    [PATCH] USB: Debounce all connect change events
    
    This patch makes the hub driver debounce all connection changes.  Right
    now the driver only does so if the status happens to be CONNECTED at one
    particular instant.  However, the whole point of debouncing is that the
    connection is subject to transient interruptions until it has stabilized;
    hence deciding whether to debounce based on a single initial test defeats
    the entire purpose.
    
    There are some additional smaller changes that go along with the major
    one:
    
    	Comments added to hub_port_connect_change() detailing the
    	conditions under which it will be called.
    
    	Don't clear the port's connect-changed feature if it wasn't
    	set.
    
    	Skip debouncing if there wasn't a physical connection change
    	but only a logical port-enable change (or a firmware-download-
    	induced device morph -- not yet implemented).
    
    	Clear all the hub status change indicators in hub_events()
    	before handling a connect change.  This will reduce syslog
    	clutter from status change bits that remain set while khubd
    	is busy taking care of a new device.
    
    The patch includes no changes to the debounce routine itself.  Please
    apply.

    [PATCH] USB: Code cleanup for the UHCI driver
    
    This patch makes some simple cleanups in the UHCI driver:
    
    	It introduces msecs_to_jiffies() conversions and uses msleep().
    
    	It wakes up threads waiting for an endpoint to be disabled
    	in the oddball case where interrupts aren't working.  (This
    	should have been in a previous patch but I missed it.)
    
    	It disables PCI interrupt generation whenever the controller
    	is reset and enables it when the controller is started.  This
    	may possibly solve some people's problems with suspend/resume.

    At the label PMError, kobject_unregister is called, which decrements the
    recount by 2, which will result in calling release at label Done (put_device).
    
    kobject_unregister should be superseded by kobject_del.

    [PATCH] fix check_region usage in eata_pio
    
    Based on "eata_generic.h", this SCSI controller has 9 bytes of IO
    space, not 8, so update request_region(), release_region(), and
    n_io_port to use 9 instead of 8.

    I converted your patch to use the DMA-API.  This will be necessary to
    use the EISA advansys boards---Of course, EISA won't work properly until
    the entire driver is converted to the driverfs probing API, sigh, but
    I'll get around to that eventually.
    
    OK, and I couldn't resist getting rid of the stupid in_isr locking on
    the done function.

    [PATCH] USB: kyocera 7135 patch
    
    Here is a patch based on 2.6.7-rc2 that makes the Kyocera 7135 work.
    The Kyocera appears to have the same setup as the Trio.  Its endpoints
    are laid out like this:
    
    > >>>type                  address
    > >>>usb bulk out:         0x01
    > >>>usb interrupt in:     0x82
    > >>>usb bulk out:         0x03
    > >>>usb bulk in:          0x84
    The last two are the ones used for the syncing communication.
    
    So the patch adds the ids for the kyocera and makes the treo_attach
    function handle the kyocera too.  I also changed the comment; it appears
    there was an error in the original comment about the treo:

    It looks like those errors you see are caused by a bug in the usblp

    This patch adds class support to arch/i386/kernel/cpuid.c. This enables udev

    Here are the results for the SMP:
    
    [hlinder@w-hlinder2 hlinder]$ tree /sys/class/cpuid
    /sys/class/cpuid
    |-- cpu0
    |   `-- dev
    `-- cpu1

    [hlinder@w-hlinder2 hlinder]$ more /sys/class/cpuid/cpu1/dev
    203:1
    [hlinder@w-hlinder2 hlinder]$
    
    And for the UP:
    
    [root@w-hlinder2 root]# tree /sys/class/cpuid
    /sys/class/cpuid
    `-- cpu0
        `-- dev

    [Driver Model] Add default attributes for classes class devices.
    
    - add struct class::class_attrs, which is designed to point to an
      array of class_attributes that are added when the class is registered
      and removed when the class is unregistered.
      This allows for more consolidated and cleaner definition of and
      management of attributes.
    
    - Add struct class::class_dev_attrs to do something similarly for
      class devices. Each class device that is registered with the class
      gets that set of attributes added for them, and subsequently removed
      when the device is unregistered.
    
    Each array depends on a terminating attribute with a NULL name. Hint:
    use the new __ATTR_NULL macro to terminate it.

    [Driver Model] Consolidate attribute definition macros
    
    - Create __ATTR(), __ATTR_RO(), and __ATTR_NULL macros to help define
      attributes in a neat, short-hand form.
    
    - Apply these macros to the attribute definition in include/linux/device.h
    
    - Note: These can be used to more cleanly define attributes in your own
      code. e.g:
    
    	static struct device_attribute attrs[] = {
    		__ATTR_RO(foo),
    		__ATTR_RO(bar),
    		__ATTR(baz,0666,baz_show,baz_store),
    		__ATTR_NULL,

    [PATCH] USB: Move usb_new_device() et al. into hub.c
    
    This patch moves usb_new_device(), usb_disconnect(), usb_choose_address(),
    and usb_release_address() from usb.c to hub.c.  As a side benefit,
    choose_address() and release_address() can now become static.  The other
    two can't, because they have to be exported for use by HCD's when
    registering/unregistering root hubs.
    
    Some other features of the patch:
    
    	The usb_snddefctrl() and usb_rcvdefctrl() macros have been
    	removed, since only one of them was used and only in one spot.
    
    	The comment about configuration choice needing to interact with
    	hub power budgeting has been moved in accordance with David's
    	wish.  usb_new_device() checks to make sure a configuration
    	could be chosen and logs a warning if no choice was made.
    
    	Following Linus's preference, the #ifdef preprocessor stuff has
    	been removed from around the calls the show_string routine.  It
    	is now defined as a non-inline routine when debugging is enabled
    	and as an inline no-op otherwise (the compiler will optimize
    	away the useless tests).

    This patch stops changing the reported fault mode in cases where retries of

    Plus, it stops printing messages when retrying.
    
    It also reduces the number of retries; the first retry seems to resolve most
    of these firmware problems.

    [PATCH] Stop megaraid trashing other i960 based devices
    
    From: Alan Cox <alan@redhat.com>
    
    In 2.4 the megaraid driver was careful to avoid stepping on wrong devices.
    Specifically the megaraid3 series devices used an intel pci ID (8086:1960)
    which is the generic i960 identifier not their own.
    
    The code to do this in 2.4 worked for almost all cases, but even that code has
    mysteriously vanished in 2.6 meaning the megaraid driver trashes stuff like
    promise i2o cards and compaq management cards.
    
    The following patch puts back the 2.4 stuff + one additional check so that the
    driver isn't quite as rude as it was before.

    [PATCH] move scsi debugging helpers and give them sane names
    
     - give the constants.c prettyprinting helpers proper scsi_ prefixed
       names (and keep compat versions for 2.6.x)
     - move them to include/scsi/scsi_dbg.h so now really only legacy stuff
       is left in drivers/scsi/scsi.h

    [NETDRV #2] Use driver-specific name for resources
    
    Here is the next part which uses a driver-specific name instead of
    dev->name for resource allocations prior to netdev registration.
    It also changes printks that are in direct response to errors in
    resource allocations.

    [PATCH] Nuke HAS_IP_COPYSUM for net drivers
    
    Entirely untested, but Obviously Correct(TM). HAS_IP_COPYSUM has been
    utterly meaningless for a long time.

    [ACPI] PCI IRQ update (Bjorn Helgaas)
    http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2574
    
    mp_parse_prt() and iosapic_parse_prt() used to allocate all
    IRQs, whether devices needed them or not.  Some devices
    failed because the this method enabled unused PCI Interrupt
    Link Devices, which disrupted active link devices.
    
    Now the PRT knowledge is pulled out of the arch
    code and the IRQ allocation and IO-APIC programming
    is done by pci_enable_device().
    This is also a step toward allowing the addition
    of new root bridges and PRTs at run-time.
    
    The architecture supplies
    
     unsigned int
     acpi_register_gsi(u32 gsi, int edge_level, int active_high_low)
    
    which is called by acpi_pci_irq_enable().  ACPI supplies
    all the information from the PRT, and the arch sets up
    the routing and returns the IRQ it allocated.
