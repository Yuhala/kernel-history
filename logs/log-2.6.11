    Patch from Sascha Hauer
    
    This patch fixes the handling of the dma interrupt acknowledge register (DISR).
    A DMA interrupt is acknowledged by setting the corresponding bit in
    DISR. So we are not allowed to use |= on this register because we could
    lose interrupts.

    [SERIAL] 8250 woraround for buggy uart
    
    Patch from Alex Williamson
    
    This patch adds support for detecting and working around a bug in
    the A2 rev of the Exar ST16C2550 UART.  The chip incorrectly
    advertises an EFR and mis-detects as having the wrong size FIFO.
    Much of the patch below is Russell's proposed solution to the
    problem.  The only changes I've made are to check the FIFO size
    on the part (because there is a real part with the same divisor
    ID and larger FIFO) and save and restore the LCR register around
    the size_fifo() routine (it doesn't work correctly with a LCR
    value of 0xBF).

    The new pipe buffer merging doesn't check for the "no readers" case, so

    Make pipe "poll()" take direction of pipe into account.
    
    The pipe code has traditionally not cared about which end-point of the
    pipe you are polling, meaning that if you poll the write-only end of a
    pipe, it will still set the "this pipe is readable" bits if there is
    data to be read on the read side.
    
    That makes no sense, and together with the new bigger buffers breaks
    python-twisted.
    
    Based on debugging/patch by Andrea Arcangeli and testcase from
    Thomas Crhak

    [PATCH] ppc64: hugepage hash flushing bugfix
    
    This fixes a potentially bad (although very rarely triggered) bug in the
    ppc64 hugepage code.
    
    hpte_update() did not correctly calculate the address for hugepages, so
    pte_clear() (which we use for hugepage ptes as well as normal ones)
    would not correctly flush the hash page table entry.  Under the right
    circumstances this could potentially lead to duplicate hash entries,
    which is very bad.
    
    davem's upcoming patch to pass the virtual address directly to set_pte()
    and its ilk will obsolete this, but this is bad enough it should
    probably be fixed in the meantime.

    [PATCH] r8169: IRQ races during change of mtu
    
    IRQ races during change of mtu
    - NAPI poll must be enabled prior to IRQ activation or the IRQ handler
      will not know what to do with an incoming packet;
    - rtl8169_down() needs to try twice to sync with the IRQ handler when
      it is not issued under !netif_running() protection.
    
    Both changes make it safe to request a change of mtu on a live device.

    [PATCH] Fix possible futex mmap_sem deadlock
    
    Some futex functions do get_user calls while holding mmap_sem for
    reading.  If get_user() faults, and another thread happens to be in mmap
    (or somewhere else holding waiting on down_write for the same
    semaphore), then do_page_fault will deadlock.  Most architectures seem
    to be exposed to this.
    
    To avoid it, make sure the page is available.  If not, release the
    semaphore, fault it in and retry.
    
    I also found another exposure by inspection, moving some of the code
    around avoids the possible deadlock there.

    [libata] Add missing hooks, to avoid oops in advanced SATA drivers
    
    Advanced SATA drivers should not (and cannot) use the basic
    PCI IDE hooks for checking the Status and Error registers, as these
    registers are either in non-standard locations, or simply don't
    exist.
    
    In the error handling path, libata was unconditionally calling some
    PCI IDE hardware bitbanging functions, which would cause an oops
    in the AHCI driver and any other advanced libata driver.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Wrong vaddr in flush_hash_one_pte()
    
    Reworking the ppc32 mm helps me find interesting bugs in the existing bug,
    well, brown paper bag for me, I made this one a while ago.
    
    The routine flush_hash_one_pte() used by ptep_test_and_clear_young()
    wasn't properly recaclulating the vaddr from the pte pointer &
    page->index.  The result is that we probably never flushed things from
    the hash, so that's at least the _second_ bug affecting
    ptep_test_and_clear_young(), swap on ppc32 must have been really broken
    :(

    [PATCH] ppc32: kernel mapping breakage
    
    Christoph Lameter's patch that change page allocators to use GFP_ZERO
    broke ppc32 in a subtle way. Our allocator is designed to work before
    mem_init_done, in which cases it uses a ppc specific early_get_page()
    which doesn't return zeroed pages. However, he removed the call to
    clear_page() unconditionally, thus causing the kernel initial page
    tables to have random data in them.
    
    They are initialized with set_pte, which means it's _mostly_ harmless,
    except that set_pte on ppc32 preserves the _PAGE_HASHPTE bit, thus we
    end up with random bits there, which can cause issues with further
    manipulation of the kernel page tables and will slow down all hash
    faults to them causing unnecessary searches.

    is that the computation is recalc_ssthresh is incorrect and
    BICTCP_1_OVER_BETA/2 should be BICTCP_1_OVER_BETA*2.
    
    My fix is to implement the code from BIC TCP 1.1 which uses a sysctl
    to set the beta.  There are a few variable name changes from the 1.1
    code, and made the scaling factor a #define instead of hardcoded.

    [PATCH] natsemi long cable fix
    
    This is a minor modification to the previous patch submission that does
    not assume the default contents of the DSPCFG register are zero.
    
    When used with Revision D of the DP83815, the "Recommended Registers
    Configuration" from page 78 of the DP83815 data sheet is not entirely
    compatible with the driver's "short cable patch".  When the DSPCFG
    register is written with the value suggested in the document, then
    do_cable_magic() can't read the DSP coefficient and determines that all
    cables attached to the DP83815D are 'short', regardless of actual
    length.  Short cables (< 30m) cause do_cable_magic to enable additional
    attenuation to reduce CRC and idle errors.  If the extra attenuation is

    x86: when choosing PCI starting address, print out gap information
    
    This makes for better messages on what is going on. It also
    allows us (if we want to), to pick the PCI starting address
    somewhere else in the gap. That may be a good idea (ie do a
    
    	pci_mem_start = (gapstart + (gapsize >> 3) + 0xfffff) & ~0xfffff;
    
    or similar.

    Be more careful about looking for gaps in the e820 table.
    
    We really don't care about anything beyond the 4GB mark,
    so make the tests for that explicit (and add a comment),
    and use regular "unsigned long" for the gap information.

    [ARM PATCH] 2493/1: put IXP2000 slowport in 8-bit mode after boot
    
    Patch from Lennert Buytenhek
    
    This is an old patch from 2.6.9-rc3-ds2 that never made it upstream.
    The IXP2000 slowport has two modes of operation, 8-bit and 32-bit.
    The slowport itself is a byte-wide bus, and in 8-bit mode, it does the
    more-or-less obvious thing: every word read causes four byte reads,
    and those bytes are then combined into a word according to the xscale
    core's current endian setting.  So, what value you get depends on what
    endianity your IXP2000 is running in.
    In 32-bit mode, however, it is the slowport itself which combines
    bytes into words, and for this it unconditionally uses little endian
    mode.  In this mode, word reads from the slowport will return the
    same value no matter whether the xscale core is running in big or
    little endian mode.  This can be a plus in some cases.  Byte (and
    halfword) accesses in 32-bit mode have rather useless semantics
    due to this, though.
    The usefulness of 32-bit mode is limited to the initial boot.  When
    the IXP2000 resets, the slowport is always in 32-bit mode, so if you
    flash the bootloader into flash (which is connected to the slowport)
    using little-endian byte ordering, the xscale will always read the
    instruction stream correctly, no matter whether it's running in big
    or little endian mode.
    After booting it makes no sense to use 32-bit mode anymore.  Especially
    since the slowport's word ordering in 32-bit mode is little endian,
    and the IXP2000 is conventionally run in big endian, which gives all
    kinds of fun issues when trying to access peripherals connected to
    the slowport.
    In fact, the current MTD map driver for IXP2000 already sets the
    slowport to 8-bit mode because it cannot access the flash otherwise.
    However, this means that if the MTD map driver is not compiled in for
    some reason, the slowport will stay in 32-bit mode after the initial
    boot, which will cause peripheral accesses to unexpectedly break!

    [PATCH] Fix buf in zeromap_pud_range() losing virtual address
    
    This patch fixes a nasty bug that took us almost a week to track down on
    ppc64, introduced by the 4L page table changes, and resulting in random
    memory corruption. All archs that rely on a PTE page's struct page to
    contain the mm & address (in mapping/index) will be affected.
    
    zeromap_pud_range() is one of these page tables walking functions that
    split the address into a base and an offset. It forgets to add back the
    "base" when calling the lower level zeromap_pmd_range(), thus passing a
    bogus virtual address. Most archs won't care, unless they do the above,
    since the lower level can allocate a PTE page.
    
    Kudo's to Michael Ellerman too who spent that week running tests after
    tests to track it down, since the only way we managed to get it to show
    up was after about 1 to 2h of LTP runs ...
    
    (Note: We are in _urgent_ need to consolidate all those page table
    walking functions, they all do things in a subtely different way, with
    different checks (sometimes redudant) and inconsitent with each other,
    even within a given set of them. Hopefully, Nick has some work in
    progress there).

    [PATCH] Check for wraps in copy_page_range
    
    While browsing the 4 level page table changes (looking for a bug), I

    or that sort of thing.

    [PATCH] Fix possible race with 4level-fixup.h
    
    When using 4level-fixup.h, a PMD page may end up beeing freed before the
    matching PGD entry is cleared due to the way the compatibility macros
    work. This can cause nasty races on some architectures.
    
    This patch fixes it by defining pud_clear() to be pgd_clear(). That
    means we'll actually write 0 twice, a small price to pay here,
    especially seeing how easy it is to convert to the new headers anyway
    (hint hint, ppc & ppc64 patches as soon as 2.6.11 is out).

    [PATCH] USB: ehci requeue revisit
    
    This gets rid of a bug found in some IRQ handling logic, after tripping
    a debug assertion.  Basically, a recent patch called the wrong routine to
    unlink a QH.  Net result, it wasn't allowing for the case that some other
    QH was already being unlinked.  This patch uses the correct routine; the
    names are confusingly similar, and the effect is often identical.
    
    The consequence of using the wrong routine was that the driver could
    lose one of the pending unlinks (probably wedging some activity) and
    treat the other one as completed before it was safe to do so (which
    probably wouldn't oops, but could cause other nasty corruption).

    http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2005-02/msg00053.html

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20050211 from Bob Moore
    
    Implemented ACPI 3.0 support for implicit conversion within
    the Match() operator. match_obj can now be of type
    integer, buffer, or string instead of just type integer.
    Package elements are implicitly converted to the type
    of the match_obj. This change aligns the behavior of
    Match() with the behavior of the other logical operators
    (LLess(), etc.)  It also requires an errata change to the
    ACPI specification as this support was intended for ACPI
    3.0, but was inadvertently omitted.
    
    Fixed a problem with the internal implicit "to buffer"
    conversion.  Strings that are converted to buffers will
    cause buffer truncation if the string is smaller than the
    target buffer. Integers that are converted to buffers will
    not cause buffer truncation, only zero extension (both as
    per the ACPI spec.) The problem was introduced when code
    was added to truncate the buffer, but this should not be
    performed in all cases, only the string case.
    
    Fixed a problem with the Buffer and Package operators
    where the interpreter would get confused if two such
    operators were used as operands to an ASL operator (such
    as LLess(Buffer(1){0},Buffer(1){1}).  The internal result
    stack was not being popped after the execution of these
    operators, resulting in an AE_NO_RETURN_VALUE exception.
    
    Fixed a problem with constructs of the form
    Store(Index(...),...). The reference object returned from
    Index was inadvertently resolved to an actual value. This
    problem was introduced in version 20050114 when the
    behavior of Store() was modified to restrict the object
    types that can be used as the source operand (to match
    the ACPI specification.)
    
    Reduced stack use in acpi_get_object_info().

    [NET]: Add netdev argument to dst ifdown.
    
    This patch adds a net_device argument to ifdown.  After all,
    it's a bit silly to notify someone of an ifdown event without

    Fix bogus opost buffer size check
    
    Noted while going through the n_tty code: that buffer check
    used to check against the size of the temporary kernel buffer,
    but since the tty layer was changed to use kernel buffers
    though-out, the kernel buffer array became just a pointer, and
    the check was limiting the opost blocksize to the size of a
    pointer, which makes no sense.
    
    Just remove it, since now the whole buffer is always in kernel
    space.

    Limit tty IO chunking to 2kB
    
    The NTTY code can get confused by 4kB chunks, apparently
    because n_tty_receive_room() will claim to have more room
    than n_tty_receive_buf() can actually accept.
    
    Until somebody figures out what the real n_tty_receive_room()
    logic should be, let's just limit it to a safe 2kB.
    
    Thanks go to Andreas Schwab for finding a test-case.

    [PATCH] r8169: merge of Realtek's code
    
    Merge of Realtek's code
    - code dedicated to a new phy (spotted by Richard Dawe);
    - C+ register fiddling seems required for both RTL_GIGA_MAC_VER_{D/E};
    - apart from being reserved, register at address 0xe2 is named 'IntrMitigate';
    - bump version number.
      A bunch of people do not use the vanilla kernel module simply because
      Realtek's driver has a higher revision number. This is not an issue per
      se but their driver is buggy due to some partial merge of in-kernel code.

    [PATCH] r8169: endianness fixes
    
    Endianness fixes
    
    - rtl8169_rx_csum() forgot to convert the descriptor to cpu order,
    - same thing for rtl8169_rx_vlan_skb() but this one is more tricky as
      the layout of the (u32) word in the 8169 descriptor calls for a
      second level of swap at the vlan tag level (u16). The old code only
      did the second part (in an endian-dependant way, how fun).
    - rtl8169_tx_vlan_tag(): this time the (u32 descriptor level) cpu_to_le32

    Summary: avoid even calls to cpu_to_{b/l}eXX on a given piece of data.
    
    The change has no effect on x86. Now sparc64 talks to x86.

    [ARM PATCH] 2473/1: fix alignment trap handler for big-endian
    
    Patch from Lennert Buytenhek
    
    The alignment trap handler in arch/arm/mm/alignment.c performs halfword
    and word accesses by translating them into byte accessing and then
    combining the pieces.  However, it assumes little-endian byte ordering
    in doing so, which causes unaligned accesses on big-endian platforms
    to erroneously load or store byteswapped data.
    This patch was pulled from an old 2.4 -ds tree, and appears to fix the
    issue.  It was submitted for 2.4 at the time (ARM patch ID 1205/1206),
    but rejected since big-endian ARM platforms are not supported in 2.4.

    Claim Topic TP560 data/fax/voice modem.  This device reports as class 0x0780,

                    Region 0: I/O ports at a400 [size=8]

    Some rc.serial scripts extract IRQ and I/O port information from
    /proc/pci and stuff it into an unused port using setserial.  That
    doesn't work reliably anymore because pci_enable_device() is never
    called, so the IRQ may not be enabled.

    [PATCH] Fix small vmalloc per allocation limit
    
    The vmap vmalloc rework in 2.5 had a unintended side effect.  vmalloc uses
    kmalloc now to allocate an array with a list of pages.  kmalloc has a 128K
    maximum.  This limits the vmalloc maximum size to 64MB on a 64bit system
    with 4K pages.  That limit causes problems with other subsystems, e.g.
    iptables relies on allocating large vmallocs for its rule sets.
    
    This is a bug IMHO - on 64bit platforms there shouldn't be such a low limit
    on the vmalloc size.  And even on 32bit it's too small for custom kernels
    with enlarged vmalloc area.
    
    Another problem is that this makes vmalloc unreliable.  After the system
    has been running for some time it is unlikely that kmalloc will be able to
    allocate >order 2 pages due to memory fragmentation.
    
    This patch takes the easy way out for fixing this by just allocating this
    array with vmalloc when it is larger than a page.  While more complicated
    and intrusive solutions would be possible they didn't use vmalloc
    recursively they didn't seem it worth to handle this very infrequent case.
    
    Please note that the vmalloc recursion is strictly bounded because each
    nested allocation will generate a much smaller stack frame.  Also the
    kernel stack can handle even a few recursion steps easily because vmalloc
    has only a small stack frame.

    [PATCH] general split_vma hugetlb fix
    
    My recent do_munmap hugetlb fix has proved inadequate.  There are
    other places (madvise, mbind, mlock, mprotect) where split_vma is
    called.  Only mprotect excludes a hugetlb vma: the others are in
    danger of splitting at a misaligned address, causing later BUGs.
    
    So move the ~HPAGE_MASK check from do_munmap to split_vma itself;
    and fix up those places (madvise and mlock) which expect split_vma
    can fail only with -ENOMEM, and wish to convert that to -EAGAIN.
    (It appears genuine that some of these syscalls should be failing
    with -ENOMEM and some with -EAGAIN, so respect those behaviours.)
    
    madvise_dontneed doesn't use split_vma, but is equally in danger
    of causing a hugetlb BUG via zap_page_range.  Whereas elsewhere the
    patch is permissive (allowing the operation on a hugetlb vma even when
    pointless, so long as it doesn't missplit it), here we must use -EINVAL
    on any hugetlb vma, since a page fault would hit the BUG in its nopage.

    This patch fixes the problem reported in:
    
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=110798711911645&w=2
    
    
    The 5700 link problem was caused by reading uninitialized values in sram and
    causing capacitive coupling mode to be enabled by mistake. This patch fixes
    the problem by properly validating the sram contents.

    [PATCH] Fix the mincore() syscall
    
    This fixes the mincore syscall in three ways:
    
     (1) It moves as much argument checking outside of the semaphore-holding
         region as possible.
    
     (2) It checks the region parameters against TASK_SIZE so that a 32-bit binary
         on a 64-bit platform will get the right error when calling this syscall
         on a region that overlaps the end of the 32-bit address space.
    
     (3) It tidies up the VMA checking loop a little.

    [PATCH] i2c compat ioctl breakage
    
    do_i2c_rdwr_ioctl() does two compat_alloc_user_space().  That doesn't
    work; no state is kept and second allocation will ignore the first one
    (i.e.  give overlapping chunk of user stack).

    The mcd driver drives only very old hardware (some single and double speed
    CD drives that were connected either via the soundcard or a special ISA
    card), and the mcdx driver offers more functionality for the same hardware.
    
    My plan is to mark MCD as broken in 2.6.11 and if noone complains
    completely remove this driver some time later.

    [PATCH] radeonfb update
    
    It adds the sleep support for newer powermacs, improve power saving on some
    laptops, makes use of the new fbdev modelist management routines, and fixes
    a few backlight related issues.
    
    I tested it on a thinkpad T30 and a few PPC boxes with success.  It should
    be less invasive than the previous one (I don't try to restore the mode on
    exit, that is what breaks the thinkpad and possibly other stuffs that boot
    in VGA text mode), plus fixed a couple of bugs in the mode detection code.
    I also reverted the memory map fix on ppc since it doesn't work properly on
    some recent laptops where the firmware sets a tiled display.  I'll rework
    that completely to update the memory map as part of the mode setting later.
    That should fix various issues when switching with X/DRI on x86.

    [PATCH] Add try_acquire_console_sem
    
    The new PowerMac sleep code provides an arch hook that can be used by video
    drivers on laptops to bring back the screen very early, pretty much before
    anything else.  This basically turns reports of the style "my laptop doesn't
    wakeup" to "I get this or this oops/error/panic on wakeup", making fixing the
    PM related bugs possible on a whole range of them.
    
    However, the fbdev wakeup code triggers WARN_ON's in the VT subsystem if
    called without the console semaphore when redrawing the screen (I added those
    warnings a couple of kernel versions ago), and we can't call
    acquire_console_sem() since we are so early in the wakeup process that we are
    considered as in_atomic() (we hold irqs off too).
    
    This patch addds a try_acquire_console_sem() function that can be used by
    those video drivers that implement this early wakeup hook.  If the acquire
    fails (which should never happen in practice), wakeup is delayed to the normal
    PCI callback which does a blocking acquire_console_sem().

    [PATCH] uml: use PTRACE_OLDSETOPTIONS instead of PTRACE_SETOPTIONS
    
    In linux 2.6, PTRACE_SETOPTIONS is redefined to 0x4200, while the old 2.4
    value (21) is still available as PTRACE_OLDSETOPTIONS.
    
    So, if UML uses PTRACE_SETOPTIONS, an UML-kernel built on a 2.6 won't run
    on a 2.4 host.  Hence we must use PTRACE_OLDSETOPTIONS.
    
    For cases when PTRACE_OLDSETOPTIONS does not exists (i.e.  2.4 host or
    archs which miss it because they don't have a "deprecated" value), we
    fallback this macro to PTRACE_SETOPTIONS.

    some characters have different code from the code in updated table of MS.
    For example, the unicode for character 0xB8A3 (GBK) should be U+798F, but
    the code is U+FA1B in nls_cp936.c.
    
    Regenerated the tables.  The number of differences is rather large, so I
    did not check every change, but looking at a random sample the changes seem
    OK.  Mostly the CJK Compatibility Ideographs have been replaced by their
    ordinary equivalents.  Some code points that were unassigned now got a

    [PATCH] OProfile: ARM/XScale1 PMU support fix
    
    Richard Purdie provided a patch to fix support for XScale1 processors (this
    is the PMU version i never had access to initially), we weren't clearing
    the overflow flags after an overflow interrupt had triggered resulting in
    no additional interrupts occuring.  Additionally i've added basic power
    management support.

    [PATCH] Force read implies exec for all 32bit processes in x86-64
    
    This effectively enables executable stack and executable heap for all 32bit
    programs on x86-64, except if noexec32=on is specified.
    
    This does not support changing this with personality right now, this would
    need more intrusive changes.  A 64bit process will always turn it off and a
    32bit process turn it on.
    
    Also readd the noexec32=on option to turn this off and fix a minor bug in
    noexec=...  (would be reported as unknown option)

    [PATCH] Fix shmget for ppc64, s390-64 & sparc64.
    
    The second parameter of the sys_ipc system wrapper on ppc64, s390-64 and
    sparc64 is an "int".  sys_shmget gets called with this 32 bit value as the
    size parameter.  This limits the maximum shared memory segment on these
    three architectures to 2GB.  To fix this the second parameter is declared
    as an "unsigned long" and is then casted to the type required by the The
    same int vs.  unsigned long bug is fixed for sys_msgsnd and sys_msgrcv as
    well.

    [PATCH] Fix compat shmget overflow
    
    This fixes an incorrect sign extension in the compat layer that breaks
    32bit shmget that are >2GB.  sys_shmget has a signed size_t size argument,
    and the int size argument coming from 32bit user space would get sign
    extended to 64bit, which is wrong.
    
    I fixed it on all compat architectures, except PPC64 which was already ok.
    
    It was originally debugged and fixed by Karl Rister @ IBM for SLES9 on x86-64.

    [PATCH] L18 flash corruption fix
    
    Another fix to the put_chip() concurrency logic.
    
    Problem was occurring when:
    
    1) one thread was erasing a block in partition x;
    2) another thread suspended the erase in order to write to
       partition y;
    3) a third thread came along to read a different block from
       partition x and, when it called put_chip(), chip->oldstate was
       FL_ERASING and the erase (mistakenly) resumed;
    4) the write in partition y obviously failed at that point.
    
    Incidentally, the fix for this problem also fixed the case where
    suspending writes for MTD XIP usage was not working properly.

    [PATCH] sonypi: add fan and temperature status/control
    
    1. FAN Status/Control: you can now get the fan status (running or not) and
       also set the fan speed (for <5 seconds only). The problem is that there
       is an auto regulator that kicks in within about 5 seconds after that to
       restart the fan if it is above a threshold temperature (39 Degree C in
       my Vaio). It is useful just to get the fan status (primarily). It also
       appears that you can change the speed by increasing the values (much
       like the LCD control) - there are effectively only about 6 speeds (it
       seems - not sure, but from what I've played with on my Vaio).
    
    2. Temperature: you can get the current temperature (same as reported by
       ACPI). This is primarily useful for APM users (since ACPI already gives
       this). I have used this to detect when the fan comes on in my Vaio (39
       Degree C).

    [PATCH] Fix oops in alloc_zeroed_user_highpage() when page is NULL
    
    The generic and IA-64 versions of alloc_zeroed_user_highpage() don't
    check the return value from alloc_page_vma().  This can lead to an oops
    if we're OOM.
    
    This fixes my oops on PPC64, but I haven't got an IA-64 machine/compiler
    handy.

    drm: fix race condition in radeon driver
    
    Close a race which could allow for privilege escalation by users with DRI
    privileges on Radeon hardware.  Essentially, a malicious program could submit
    a packet containing an offset (possibly in main memory) to be rendered from/to,
    while a separate thread switched that offset in userspace rapidly between a
    valid value and an invalid one.  radeon_check_and_fixup_offset() would pull the
    offset in from user space, check it, and spit it back out to user space to be
    copied in later by the emit code.  It would sometimes catch the bad value, but
    sometimes the malicious program could modify it after the check and get an
    invalid offset rendered from/to.
    
    Fix this by allocating a temporary buffer and copying the data in at once.
    While here, make the cliprects stuff not do the VERIFYAREA_READ and
    COPY_FROM_USER_UNCHECKED gymnastics, avoiding a lock order reversal on FreeBSD.
    Performance impact is negligible  -- no difference on r200 to ~1% improvement on
    rv200 in quake3 tests (P4 1Ghz, demofour at 1024x768, n=4 or 5)

    [PATCH] NOMMU: Improved handling of get_unmapped_area() errors
    
    The attached patch does two things:
    
     (1) We no longer check the return value of file->f_op->get_unmapped_area()
         unless we actually called it. We know addr is zero otherwise because
         we'd've given an error earlier if it wasn't.
    
     (2) If -ENOSYS was returned by that operation, then we assume we actually
         called a driver (such as the framebuffer driver) that might want to
         invoke the operation in a lower level driver (such as matroxfb) if one
         exists, and that it found that one didn't.
    
         We translate the -ENOSYS error into -ENODEV - the error we would have
         given if the operation was not supplied in the file ops.
    
         Doing this permits us an opportunity for arch_get_unmapped_area() or
         something else to be called if we want that to happen, particularly in
         the MMU case.

    [PATCH] uml: hostfs: (security) fix chmod +s permission check
    
    Frank Fricke reported that hostfs does not verify that a chmod +s, for
    instance, is done by a sufficiently privileged user, as long as the UML
    kernel itself can complete the operation on the host.
    
    So, for instance, if UML is run as root and under /mnt/host we have a hostfs
    mount, this works successfully:
    
    paolo@zion:~ (0)$ chmod 4755 /mnt/host/bin/bash
    paolo@zion:~ (0)$ ll /mnt/host/bin/bash
    
     -rwsr-xr-x  1 root root 662724 2004-10-20 02:15 /mnt/host/bin/bash*
    
    (bash refuses running as setuid, but you could have another shell on the
    host, as dash or whatever).
    
    In general, if UML is run as uid 500 on the host, a hostfs mount is done
    and under the hostfs mount there is a file with uid 500 on the host, I can
    freely make it setuid (if it's executable).
    
    This is especially bad when UML is run as root (which you should not do),
    but is a problem in general, since it allows any user to create setuid 500
    (in this example) executables on the host filesystem.
    
    Finally, while I was looking at the chmod() implementation, I spotted a
    kludge in the code and explained it with a comment.

    [PATCH] fix wait_task_inactive race
    
    When a task is put to sleep, it is dequeued from the runqueue while it is
    still running.  The problem is that one some arches that have non-atomic
    scheduling, the runqueue lock can be dropped and retaken in schedule() before
    the task actually schedules off, and wait_task_inactive did not account for
    this.

    mousedev_packet() clears list->ready too early when called with

    [NETLINK]: Use SKB_MAXORDER to calculate NLMSG_GOODSIZE
    
    NLMSG_GOODSIZE specifies a good default size for the skb tailroom
    used in netlink messages when the size is unknown at the time of
    the allocation.
    
    The current value doesn't make much sense anymore because
    skb_shared_info isn't taken into account which means that
    depending on the architecture NLMSG_GOOSIZE can exceed PAGE_SIZE
    resulting in a waste of almost a complete page.
    
    Using SKB_MAXORDER solves this potential leak at the cost of
    slightly smaller but safer sizes for some architectures.

    [NETFILTER]: Clean NAT status bits on module unload
    
    another patch which I think should go in 2.6.11, it fixes a crash
    when unloading, then reloading iptable_nat.
    
    ip_nat_core doesn't clear the status bits in struct ip_conntrack on
    module unload, but zeroes out the nat area. When the module is loaded
    again and a connection times out ip_nat_cleanup_conntrack tries to
    list_del the zeroed list-head and crashes. There are probably more
    conditions under which it can crash or cause other misbehaviour.

    [ARM PATCH] 2458/1: prevent PXA2xx defines from clashing with SA1111's
    
    Patch from Nicolas Pitre
    
    A more elegant solution could be applied which would require more work.
    However there is only one platform using both chips (Lubbock) and half
    of the SA1111 features are unusable due to botched DMA support at the
    PCB level anyway.  Therefore this solution should be sufficient for
    now.
    Also removed the SADIV defines which use would not constitute good
    programming practice. Divisors should be computed directly in the code
    especially since different PXA2xx versions have different clock source
    frequencies.  No in-tree driver uses them so this is low impact..
    Finally changed alignment to fit rest of file.

    [PATCH] libata: fix ata_piix on ICH6R in RAID mode
    
    Here is the cleaned up patch (as you suggested) that enables ata_piix
    to work in RAID mode on ICH6R.  I tested it and it seems to behave
    correctly
    
    in all the modes---sees all 4 disks in IDE and RAID modes, doesn't
    see any in Compatibility mode (which is right, because only two are
    available and the regular IDE driver has picked them up already).
    
    
    Change description:  only test for PCI IDE legacy mode, via the
    PCI programming interface register, if the PCI device is of class
    PCI_CLASS_STORAGE_IDE.

    Also kill kfree_skb_fast(), that is a relic from fast switching
    which was killed off years ago.
    
    The bug is that in the case where we do the atomic_read()
    optimization, we need to make sure that reads of skb state
    later in __kfree_skb() processing (particularly the skb->list
    BUG check) are not reordered to occur before the counter
    read by the cpu.

    [PATCH] do_munmap() hugetlb fix
    
    The hugetlb_page test in do_munmap is too permissive.  It checks start vma,
    but forgets that end vma might be different and huge though start is not:
    so hits unmap_hugepage_range BUG if misaligned end was given.
    
    And it's too restrictive: munmap has always succeeded on unmapped areas
    within its range, why should it behave differently near a hugepage vma?
    
    And the additional checks in is_aligned_hugepage_range are irrelevant here,
    when the hugepage vma already exists.  But the function is still required
    (on some arches), as the default for prepare_hugepage_range - leave
    renaming cleanup to another occasion.

    When looking for identical xattr blocks to share, we were not comparing the
    name_index fields.  This could lead to false sharing when two xattr blocks
    ended up with identical attribute names and values, and the only default
    acls.  Because acls are cached, the bug was hidden until the next reload of
    the affected inode.
    
      $ mkdir -m 700 a b
      $ setfacl -m u:bin:rwx a
    	< acl of a goes in the mbcache
    
      $ setfacl -dm u:bin:rwx b
    	< acl of b differs only in name_index, so a's acl is reused
    
      $ getfacl b
    	< shows the result from the inode cache
    
      < empty inode cache (remount, etc.)
    
      $ getfacl b
    	< shows an access acl instead of a default acl.

    [PATCH] remove truncate mapped BUG
    
    It's time to remove truncate_complete_page's BUG_ON(page_mapped(page)): it
    was there to give confidence in the new vm_truncate_count mechanism.
    Earlier releases had no such check, and it wouldn't be at all helpful if it
    ever bugged up file truncation on a production system - though we don't
    know of any scenario in which that could happen now.

    [PATCH] tmpfs caused truncate BUG
    
    Just before removing truncate_complete_page's BUG_ON(page_mapped(page)),
    thought I'd recheck on a few filesystems.  The shame!  Easily triggered
    with tmpfs: not because of recent changes, but because shmem_nopage omitted
    the i_size_read from Andrea's careful truncate_count/i_size_read
    /cachelookup/truncate_count sequence.  For varying reasons, other users of
    shmem_getpage can't go beyond i_size, so just add it to shmem_nopage.

    [PATCH] Fix PPC rwlock code on SMP
    
    Currently, the kernel won't compile for SMP ppc32 if preempt is
    enabled.  This patch adds suitable read_can_lock and write_can_lock
    definitions.
    
    This patch also adds a real _raw_read_trylock (inline and out-of-line
    versions), changes the rwlock->lock field to a signed int, which is
    what it really was all along, and cleans up the out-of-line rwlock
    code in arch/ppc/lib/locks.c.  It removes the debug fields from the
    rwlock struct because we were never using them, even with
    CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK set.
    
    I have compile and boot tested this with the four combinations of
    CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCKS on and off, and CONFIG_PREEMPT on and off.
    Please put this patch into 2.6.11 so that 2.6.11 will work for
    ppc32 with CONFIG_SMP and CONFIG_PREEMPT.

    According to Vojtech Pavlik:
    
    The first write after writing TN_SETVAL to the config register sets the

    When you only do the first write you never set the threshold and interrupts
    won't be generated properly.

    [PATCH] Use MM_VM_SIZE in exit_mmap
    
    The 4 level pagetable code changed the exit_mmap code to rely on TASK_SIZE.
     On some architectures (eg ppc64 and ia64), this is a per task property and
    bad things can happen in certain circumstances when using it.
    
    It is possible for one task to end up "owning" an mm from another - we have
    seen this with the procfs code when process 1 accesses /proc/pid/cmdline of
    process 2 while it is exiting.  Process 2 exits but does not tear its mm
    down.  Later on process 1 finishes with the proc file and the mm gets torn
    down at this point.
    
    Now if process 1 was 32bit and process 2 was 64bit then we end up using a
    bad value for TASK_SIZE in exit_mmap.  We only tear down part of the
    address space and leave half initialised pagetables and entries in the MMU
    etc.
    
    MM_VM_SIZE() was created for this purpose (and is used in the next line for
    tlb_finish_mmu), so use it.  I moved the PGD round up of TASK_SIZE into the
    default MM_VM_SIZE.

    [PATCH] TASK_SIZE is variable.
    
    Bad things can happen if a 32-bit process is the last user of a 64-bit mm.
    TASK_SIZE isn't a constant, and we can end up clearing page tables only up
    to the 32-bit TASK_SIZE instead of all the way.  We should probably
    double-check every instance of TASK_SIZE or USER_PTRS_PER_PGD for this kind
    of problem.
    
    We should also double-check that MM_VM_SIZE() and other such things are
    correctly defined on all architectures.  I already fixed ppc64 which let it
    stay as TASK_SIZE, and hence dependent on the _current_ context instead of
    the mm in the argument.

    When a page fault occurs on an address below the stack-vma, UML tries to

    On i386 and x86_64, the failing address is compared to the current userspace
    stack pointer.  If the failing address is below "esp-32" resp.  "rsp-128",
    stack expansion is not allowed, and a SIGSEGV is given to the user.

    If you think it cannot make sense to include both <sys/ptrace.h> and

    However, the compilation failure is possibly glibc-version (or better glibc
    includes version) related - what I now is that the failure happens on my
    system with a glibc 2.3.4 (from Gentoo).
    
    Also, fix the syscall table to both compile and have no empty slot (which
    could cause Oopses).

    [PATCH] SELinux: fix selinux_inode_setattr hook
    
    This fixes the selinux_inode_setattr hook function to honor the ATTR_FORCE
    flag, skipping any permission checking in that case.  Otherwise, it is
    possible though unlikely for a denial from the hook to prevent proper
    updating, e.g.  for remove_suid upon writing to a file.  This would only
    occur if the process had write permission to a suid file but lacked setattr
    permission to it.

    during up() processing had finished with those structures.

    From: Steffen Thoss <thoss@de.ibm.com>
    From: Frank Pavlic <pavlic@de.ibm.com>
    
    qeth network driver changes:
     - Improve performance by omitting svs.
     - Use function callback mechanism to set layer 2 parameters when getting
       a reply for a Layer 2 command.
     - dev->hard_header must not be NULL when fake_ll is no set since
       IPv6 and Layer2 needs the default function set by network stack.
     - ping6 works now when running in layer 2 mode.
     - Save original dev->hard_header to restore it when the user doesn't
       want to use fake_ll anymore.
     - Fake ethernet header in outgoing packets. This currently works
       only if qeth is compiled without ipv6 support.
     - Add more debug information in case of failures in qeth_set_offline.
     - Using fake_ll with HiperSockets devices results in misaligned
       ip packets and thus no traffic over HiperSockets.
     - Start qeth_remove_device only after the qeth recovery completed.

    [PATCH] s390: cpcmd interface
    
    - Diagnose 8 needs a response buffer below 2GB real storage.
      As the caller cannot always allocate the buffer with GFP_DMA the best
      solution is to rewrite cpcmd to use a bounce buffer if necessary.
      The old function was renamed to __cpcmd and can be called if appropriate.
      The early boot code does not provide kmalloc but need cpcmd functionality.
      These places have been converted to use __cpcmd, as the init code and data
      are below 2GB.
    - In case of an 31 bit system, cpcmd is defined as __cpcmd.
    - EXPORT_SYMBOL(cpcmd) moved into cpcmd.c
    - some whitespace fixes in cpcmd.[c/h]

    would be.  Otherwise, cpufreq_resume() always prints an error and exits

    [PATCH] device-mapper: Fixes for 64-bit sector_t
    
    Fix some bugs in device-mapper handling of 64-bit values, replacing
    dm_div_up() and dm_round_up() inlines with macros and removing some
    avoidable divisions of 64-bit numbers.
    
    The mirror region size is the granularity used to manage and monitor the
    data copying, typically 512KB, so 32 bits (of sectors) should be plenty to
    hold this.
    
    Taken together with the two earlier patches:
      "fix TB stripe data corruption" (a missing cast) and
      "stripe_width should be sector_t",
    I've now had 3 independent reports that this fixes device-mapper
    for devices with large stripes.
    
    Still awaiting test results for dm-crypt and dm-raid1.

    Not that low-level code really tends to care, but since loff_t is
    a signed 64-bit entity and size_t is unsigned (and potentially
    64-bit), mixing the two isn't very well-defined..

    The actual user copy will do them too, but only for the
    range that ends up being actually copied. That hides
    bugs when the range has been clamped by file size or other
    issues.

    [PATCH] via82cxxx: fix ppc32 multiplatform config test
    
    PPC_MULTIPLATFORM exists both for ppc32 and ppc64; chrp and pegasos,
    OTOH, are ppc32-only.  The ifdef in via82cxxx should be for
    PPC_MULTIPLATFORM and PPC32 - it makes no sense for ppc64 multiplatform
    and, as the matter of fact, simply won't compile there.

    [PATCH] md sync_page_io bio leak
    
    I accidentally introduced a leak in there, because the end_io function
    doesn't do a bio_put() like most others. Fortunately it's not critical,
    as it only happens on the md super block read. So just drop the initial
    bio_get(), since it's sync we can just bio_put() safely at the end after
    it has completed.

    [ide] remove WAIT_READY dependency on APM
    
    On the one hand APM isn't enabled on all laptops.
    On the other hand, this also affects regular PCs with APM support (or
    using a distribution kernel with APM support).
    
    The time for the !APM case was already increased from 30msec in 2.4 .
    Isn't there a timeout that is suitable for all cases?

    Until someone has a real good solution (consider e.g. that most PC users
    might have ACPI support enabled), this patch unconditionally sets
    WAIT_READY to 5 seconds.

    [PATCH] USB: Logitech Cordeless Desktop Keyboard fails to report class descriptor
    
    From: Nico Huber <nico.h@gmx.de>
    
    The receiver of my Logitech Cordeless Desktop fails to report the
    keyboard's class descriptor most times I insert the usb-hid module since I
    changed to linux 2.6.  The modell of the receiver is C-BD9-DUAL REV C.  The
    request seems not to fail but the count of received characters is zero.
    
    As I said it only fails most times, I worked around making the following
    changes in drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c from linux-2.6.11-rc2:
    
    Following the good example of drivers/usb/core/message.c line 575, I
    initialized the buffer in hid_get_class_descriptor() to zero.  In the loop
    of hid_get_class_descriptor() not waiting for any result but waiting for a
    result wich is lower the requested size of the class descriptor (line
    1290).  usb_hid_configure() should not try to parse the expected length but
    the received (line 1653).
    
    Attached is a patch with these changes

    Is that really new to 2.6.11-rc1? The kernel byte-swaps the bcdUSB,
    idVendor, idProduct, and bcdDevice fields in the device descriptor. It
    should probably swap them back before copying it up to userspace.

    Andi's diagnosis is correct -- the embedded class_device was not fully
    initialized -- but the solution is wrong.  The correct patch
    is below.  This was clearly my fault, an error in driver-model
    programming brought on by lack of documentation about which fields in the
    driver-model structures need to be set for which API calls.  (Greg, long
    ago I sent you a documentation patch to try and help remedy this problem,
    but it seems to have fallen by the wayside.)

    [PATCH] PCI: change sysfs representation of PCI-E devices
    
    Before changes:
    
    The patch makes the parent of the device pointing to the pci_dev
    structure. The parents portX devices are in /sys/devices which
    should be removed based on your suggestions. Below is /sys/devices
    before any changes made.
    
    /sys/devices
    	|
    	__ ide0
    	|
    	__ pci0000:00
    	|

    	|
    	__ port1
    	|	|
    	|  	__ port1.00
    	|	|
    	|	__ port1.01
    	|	.
    	|	.
    	|	.
    	|
    	__ port2
    	|
     	__ port3
    	|
    	__ system
    
    After changes:
    
    The parents portX devices are no longer necessary because port1.00
    and port1.01 devices shoud have the parent of the pci_dev structure
    (based on your suggestion). The patch does the following changes:
    
    - remove code creating and handling the parent portX devices.
    - rename portX.YZ to pcieYZ (for example port1.00 renamed to pcie00)
      since portX is no longer needed.
    - make pcieYZ have the parent of the pci_dev structure.
    
    Below is /sys/devices after changes made to the patch.

    i2c-viapro through i2c-dev. This is caused by a missing length check on
    a buffer operation when doing a SMBus block read in the i2c-viapro
    driver. The problem was already known and had been fixed upon report by
    Sergey Vlasov back in August 2003 in lm_sensors (2.4 kernel version of
    the driver) but for some reason it was never ported to the 2.6 kernel
    version.
    
    I am not a security expert but I would guess that such a buffer overflow
    could possibly be used to run arbitrary code in kernel space from user
    space through i2c-dev. The severity obviously depends on the permisions
    set on the i2c device files in /dev. Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to
    push this patch upstream rather sooner than later.
    
    While I was at it, I also changed a similar size check (for SMBus block
    write this time) in the same driver to use the correct constant
    I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_MAX instead of its current numerical value. This doesn't
    change a thing at the moment but prevents another potential buffer
    overflow in case the value of I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_MAX were to be changed in
    the future (admittedly unlikely though).

    It doesn't take broken hardware.
    
    (Warning: I am going technical at this point, people not interested in
    the gory details of the I2C and SMBus protocols should better stop here
    ;))
    
    It just depends on what part of the SMBus and I2C specifications a given
    client chip supports. SMBus block reads are no different from SMBus byte
    reads, except that the master (here the VIA Pro) goes on reading after
    the first byte sent by the slave (which could be about anything, from
    hardware monitoring chip to EEPROM). In that respect, it also doesn't
    much differ from the I2C block read, which also starts in the exact same
    way. The difference between SMBus block read and I2C block read is that
    the first byte returned by the slave on SMBus block read is supposed to
    be the remaining number of data byte to be sent, while this is simply
    the first data byte for I2C block reads.
    
    To make it clearer, here comes the detail of the byte read, SMBus block
    read and I2C block read commands (-> means from master to slave, <-
    means from slave to master). See the official specifications for I2C and
    SMBus for nicer graphics and additional details.
    
    Byte read:
    -> client address, write mode
    -> register address
    -> client address, read mode
    <- data byte
    
    SMBus block read:
    -> client address, write mode
    -> register address
    -> client address, read mode
    <- length byte (1 <=3D N <=3D 32)
    <- first byte
    <- next byte
    <- ...
    <- last (Nth) byte
    
    I2C block read:
    -> client address, write mode
    -> register address
    -> client address, read mode
    <- first byte
    <- next byte
    <- ...
    <- last byte
    
    In each case, the *master* decides when to stop the transfer, not the
    slave.
    
    There are two consequences for us here:
    
    1* The client chip cannot differenciate between byte read and SMBus block
    read until after it sent a first byte - which basically means that a
    given register address is specified to be read with either command, not
    both, and not using the correct one returns bogus results. i2c-dev
    allows arbitrary commands so it is possible to ask for a SMBus block
    read on a register that expects a simple byte read. The client
    innocently will answer with the register value - which the master will
    interpret as a length, and the master will then request that many
    additional data bytes. If the client features autoincrement in this
    register address range, it will most likely provide the value of the
    next registers, if not it will dumbly return the same register value
    again and again.
    
    This illustrates the fact that it doesn't take a broken chip to cause a
    buffer overflow. It only takes a SMBus block read command on a register
    for which the client did not expect it (and almost no client actually
    supports SMBus block reads at the moment). If it happens that the
    register value was greater than 32, the buffer overflow will occur
    (without Sergey's fix, that is). So, with write access to the i2c
    device files, it is actually very easy to trigger the buffer overflow,
    providing there is at least one chip on the VIA Pro SMBus.
    
    2* A client chip can obviously only implement SMBus block read or I2C
    block read for a given register address, since the sequence sent by the
    master is exactly the same. Not a big deal since a client chip is
    designed either as an I2C slave or as a SMBus slave. However the master
    doesn't know this, and i2c-dev allows arbitrary commands, so it is
    possible to use an SMBus block read on an I2C slave which expected
    instead an I2C block read, causing weird results.
    
    EEPROMs are such I2C slaves and they support I2C block reads. Now,
    imagine that a non-write-protected EEPROM hangs on my VIA Pro SMBus (a
    memory module SPD EEPROM would probably do), and for some reason i2c-dev
    gives me access to it. I can write arbitrary bytes to the EEPROM using
    simple byte writes. I could write the following bytes, in order, at some
    location: 0x80, 34 null bytes, 94 bytes of nasty code. Then, still
    through i2c-dev, I request a SMBus block read from the same location.
    The EEPROM will answer as if it were an I2C block read (it can't
    differenciate and doesn't support SMBus block reads anyway), i.e. it
    will return as many bytes as requested, in order. The VIA Pro master
    will however interpret the first byte (0x80) as a length, and will read
    128 bytes from the EEPROM, 34 of which will fill the data buffer, and 94
    will overflow. Providing I know how the kernel works, these 94 bytes
    could be used for doing presumably bad things.
    
    This illustrates the fact that the user may actually control the buffer
    overflow, indirectly, depending on what hardware is present on the bus.
    EEPROMs are the most obvious way to do it, but some hardware monitoring
    chips have RAM arrays that could presumably be used in a similar way.
    
    As a conclusion, I definitely agree that this buffer overflow isn't easy
    to exploit, as it takes a particular combination of hardware and
    non-standard permissions on i2c device files, and also requires very
    good knowledge of the I2C and SMBus protocols; it is not impossible
    though.

    [PATCH] I2C: Fix i2c-sis5595 pci configuration accesses
    
    The i2c-sis5595 bus driver has logic errors on pci configuration
    accesses. It returns an error on success and vice versa. The 2.4 kernel
    version of the driver, as found in the lm_sensors CVS repository, is
    correct, so the problem was introducted when the driver was ported to
    the 2.6 kernel tree  (in 2.6.0-test6). As odd as it sounds, the driver
    has been sitting here broken and unusable for 17 months and nobody ever
    reported, until yesterday.

    [PATCH] I2C: Reduce it87 i2c address range
    
    IT87xxF chips were never seen at any other I2C address than the default
    (0x2d) so I think that we could safely reduce the range of addresses the
    it87 drivers accepts. Currently it accepts 0x20-0x2f, I believe that
    0x28-0x2f would already be more than sufficient.
    
    (In theory, any address is possible, so whatever range we choose is
    arbitrary anyway.)

    [PATCH] I2C: Use standard temperature converters for as99127f
    
    When support for the Asus AS99127F chip was once added to the w83781d
    driver, it was decided that we would treat temp2 and temp3 as having a
    LSB of 0.25 degree C, as opposed to 0.5 degree C for the compatible
    Winbond chips. The reason why this was done seems to be a couple of
    users reporting that these temperatures were reading twice as high as it
    should for them in the first place. We had much more feedback about the
    A99127F chip since, and it turns out that the exact conversion required
    for temp2 and temp3 depends on the motherboard model. For some models
    (including my A7V133-C), we now have to multiply the readings by 2,
    effectively negating the change that was once done in the driver. For
    other models, a linear conversion formula is needed. The bottom line is
    that the raw readings from the driver are correct for no known board,
    while it would be for at least some of them if we had kept the same LSB
    as the Winbond chips are known to have. Thus I believe that the standard
    LSB of 0.5 degree C should be restored.
    
    There is no datasheet available for the AS99127F chip, so whatever was
    done was guess work (and still is). I see no reason why we would keep
    additional code in the w83781d driver to handle this former supposed
    difference, especially when the facts now tend to prove that this
    difference doesn't exist.
    
    The following patch drops the additional code and treats temp2 and temp3
    the same way for all chips supported by the w83781d driver. A similar
    change will be made to the 2.4 version of this driver, and the default
    sensors.conf will be updated accordingly. Users will have to update
    their configuration file, or their readings will of course read twice as
    high as they should due to the old conversion formulae.

    [PATCH] I2C: Resolve resource conflict between i2c-viapro and via686a
    
    Here comes the finalized version of our patch solving the PCI device
    resource conflict between the i2c-viapro bus driver and and the via686a
    chip driver. It is based on your original work and the IRC conversation
    we had yesterday.
    
    The retained solution is to not permanently register the PCI device in
    either driver. This is legitimate since we only need it at init time to
    retrieve the ISA address of a sub-device (SMBus master or integrated
    sensors), and possibly change that address on user request. Once this is
    done we can safely release the PCI device for others to use.
    
    I am really glad to see this problem finally solved, as this was the
    last remaining annoying issue left from the Linux 2.6 migration (missing
    drivers left apart), and was generating many complaints both at our
    level and at the distributions' support.

    drm_memory.h doesn't need to #include tlbflush.h
    
    The flush_tlb_kernel_range call in drm_memory.h was removed in 2003, so
    there's no more reason for this #include.

    [PATCH] amd64 compat annotations
    
     * new helper - ptr_to_compat(); inverse to compat_ptr(), with proper
       typechecking.  A lot of open-coded equivalents replaced with using
       that one.
     * a couple of severely misguiding places got back to sanity - we had
       basically
    	put_user((long)p, &foo->compat_uptr_t_field);
    
    That will, of course, cast (long)p further - to u32, but that fact is
    carefully obfuscated...  Sanitized by replacing (long)p in such places
    with ptr_to_compat(p); fortunately, there hadn't been many of those...

    [PATCH] openpromfs property_read() fix
    
    openpromfs property_read() is slightly abused by property_write() - the
    latter calls property_read(file, NULL, 0, NULL) if we still hadn't done
    any IO on that file; property_read() will do setup work and, since it's
    called with count equal to 0, do nothing else.
    
    That stopped working - now we check if *ppos is sane before doing
    anything else and that, of course, oopses.  Trivial fix is to move the
    check past that for count == 0...

    [IA64] Move allocation of per-CPU MCA data out of per_cpu_init()
    
    This patch moves the per-CPU MCA data allocation out of per_cpu_init()
    so the code can be shared for contig and discontig memory
    architectures.  Also, it means we can revert back to the old way
    of doing per_cpu_init() on UP.
    
    Also cleanup initialization of ar.k3 in setup.c.  Need to use
    ia64_tpa() rather than __pa() because address will be in region 5
    on UP build.

    [PATCH] sched: fix preemption race (Core/i386)
    
    The idle-thread-preemption-fix.patch introduced a race, which is not
    critical, but might give us an extra turn through the scheduler.  When
    interrupts are reenabled in entry.c and an interrupt occures before we
    reach the add_preempt_schedule() in preempt_schedule we get rescheduled
    again in the return from interrupt path.
    
    The patch prevents this by leaving interrupts disabled and calling a a
    seperate function preempt_schedule_irq().
    
    This split adds different plausibility checks for irq context calls and
    kernel calls.

    [PATCH] udf deadlock fix
    
    Yes, me too.  generic_shutdown_super() takes lock_super().  And udf uses
    lock_super for protecting its block allocation data strutures.  Trivial
    deadlock on unmount.
    
    Below is a fix to switch udf to it's own private locking.  It's safe
    because it doesn't intefere with VFS lock_super usage anywhere.
    
    udf_free_inode has some more updates than simply switching the used
    lock:
    
     - clear_inode() call moved outside locked section to avoid another
       deadlock
     - unused variable ino killed
     - is_directory moved into the conditional it's actually used in

    debug that one further)

    [PATCH] audit: handle loginuid through proc
    
    The audit subsystem uses netlink messages to request loginuid changes.  Due
    to the sensitivity of loginuid, netlink appears to be insufficient.  For
    instance, it is not easy to guarantee that the loginuid message will be
    handled before any other auditable actions, and there is even the remote
    possibility of the process terminating and another process with the same
    pid being created before the message is handled.  Finally, other kernel
    code, in particular selinux, is interested in easily querying the loginuid
    for inclusion in its own messages.
    
    The following patch moves loginuid handling from netlink to the
    /proc/$$/loginuid file, and adds a audit_get_loginuid() function.  It also
    includes Stephen Smalley's patch to correctly inherit the loginuid on fork.
     It has been actively discussed on the linux-audit mailing list.

    [PATCH] ppc64: p615 IOMMU fix
    
    pSeries p615 happens to have a bus hierarchy where the IDE controller for
    the built-in CD is connected directly to the PHB without an intermediate
    EADS bridge.  The new iommu/bus setup code assumed that all systems with
    EADS will have all devices under them, so this resulted in the IDE
    controller not having an iommu table allocated.
    
    To avoid this, always allocate a small table at the PHB level.  It will
    never be used for regular devices, and it's allocated out of the 256MB that
    we previously skipped.

    The Pegasos machines have the VIA IDE controller configured in a strange
    way by the firmware.  It claims to be fully native, but is actually routed
    to legacy irqs 14 and 15.
    
    This patch works around that in the driver.  In the future, I'll try to do
    an ifdef-less patch by detecting that setup from the chip, and using the
    new pci_get_legacy_ide_irq() in that case, but I don't have proper HW
    infos.  This patch is good enough in the meantime, I'll come up with a
    better one later eventually.

    [PATCH] ppc32: pmac sleep support update
    
    This patch updates the PowerMac sleep support.  The ability to sleep is now
    broken into 2 different flags, one, "may sleep" is set for all motherboards
    that we know how to put to sleep and wakeup.  It gets turned into "can sleep"
    upon a call from the video driver indicating the ability to wakeup the video
    card.  This doesn't deal with head-less machines, but this can be improved
    later.  It also adds better cache flush code, which improves stability with
    cpufreq as well as sleep.
    
    This patch actually breaks sleep support until the video drivers for the
    affected machines have been updated.  This will come as separate patches.

    [PATCH] alloc_zeroed_user_highpage() to fix the clear_user_highpage issue
    
    This patch adds a new function alloc_zeroed_user_highpage that is then used
    in the anonymous page fault handler and in the COW code to allocate zeroed
    pages.  The function can be defined per arch to setup special processing
    for user pages by defining __HAVE_ARCH_ALLOC_ZEROED_USER_PAGE.  For arches
    that do not need to do special things for user pages,
    alloc_zeroed_user_highpage is defined to simply do
    
    	alloc_page_vma(GFP_HIGHUSER | __GFP_ZERO, vma, vaddr)
    
    This patch needs to update a number of archs. Wish there was a better way
    to do this.

    [PATCH] mm: fix several oom killer bugs
    
    Fix several oom killer bugs, most important avoid spurious oom kills
    badness algorithm tweaked by Thomas Gleixner to deal with fork bombs
    
    This is the core of the oom-killer fixes I developed partly taking
    the idea from Thomas's patches of getting feedback from the exit
    path, plus I moved the oom killer into page_alloc.c as it should to
    be able to check the watermarks before killing more stuff.  This
    also tweaks the badness to take thread bombs more into account (that
    change to badness is from Thomas, from my part I'd rather rewrite
    badness from scratch instead, but that's an orthgonal issue ;).
    With this applied the oom killer is very sane, no more 5 sec waits
    and suprious oom kills.

    [PATCH] Fix BUG in io_destroy
    
    With Suparna Bhattacharya <suparna@in.ibm.com>
    
    I was running a random system call generator against mainline the other
    day and got this bug report about AIO in dmesg:
    
    kernel BUG at fs/aio.c:1249!
    
    Each ioctx structure has a "users" field that acts as a reference counter
    for the ioctx, and a "dead" flag that seems to indicate that the ioctx
    isn't associated with any particular list of IO requests.
    
    The problem, then, lies in aio.c:1247.  The io_destroy function checks the
    (old) value of the dead flag--if it's false (i.e.  the ioctx is alive),
    then the function calls put_ioctx to decrease the reference count on the
    assumption that the ioctx is no longer associated with any requests.
    Later, it calls put_ioctx again, on the assumption that someone called
    lookup_ioctx to perform some operation at some point.
    
    This BUG is caused by the reference counts being off.  The testcase that
    I provided looks for a chunk of user memory that's read-only and passes
    that to the sys_io_setup syscall.  sys_io_setup checks that the pointer
    is readable, creates the ioctx and then tries to write the ioctx handle
    back to userland.  This is where the problems start to surface.
    
    Since the pointer points to a non-writable region of memory, the write
    fails.  The syscall handler then destroys the ioctx.  The dead flag is
    zero, so io_destroy calls put_ioctx...but wait!  Nobody ever put the ioctx
    into a request list.  The ioctx is alive but not in a list, yet the
    io_destroy code assumes that being alive implies being in a request list
    somewhere.  Hence, calling put_ioctx is bogus; the reference count becomes
    0, and the ioctx is freed.  Worse yet, put_ioctx is called again (on a
    freed pointer!) to clear up the lookup_ioctx that never happened.
    put_ioctx sees that the reference count has become negative and BUGs.
    
    Suparna's patch simply takes that additional ref so that io_destroy() will
    dtrt.

    takes them off the audit_buffer sklist at which point they are lost,
    second, it allocates a new skb with 0 length payload.  Then (likely still

    This patch adds a new entry in the pci_device_id table that filters
    by class code, in order to cause unlisted NVIDIA SATA controllers to
    be probed.  In the probe function, we determine whether the device is
    a SATA or IDE controller by checking the device's bars (NVIDIA SATA
    controllers will always have 6 bars).  Bar5 I/O mapped vs. memory
    mapped is now determined programmatically by looking at the resource
    flags of the bar.

    [NETFILTER]: Improve TCP window tracking retransmission detection
    
    Under certain circumstances (high latency WAN links for instance), ack
    packets get stacked up and arrive in bulk.  The current TCP window
    tracking code interprets these numerous acks as retransmits, and
    if there are >= 3 retransmits sequentially, it resets the timeout on
    a conntrack to 5 minutes.
    
    The problem lies in the fact that the code currently only examines
    the seq number of the arriving packet, but does not also look at the
    seq number being acked.  The patch below adds this additional check.
    Unfortunately, it adds another int32 to ip_ct_tcp, but I could think
    of no other fool-proof way of fixing it (short of ripping out the
    retransmission test altogether).

    [ARM PATCH] 2430/3: TLS support for ARM
    
    Patch from Nicolas Pitre
    
    This implements TLS support in the most efficient way for all ARM
    processors in use today.  The trick is to define a specific address in
    kernel area that is made readable from user space to hold the TLS
    pointer so it is highly efficient to retrieve it with no overhead.
    Since the kernel already maps a page at 0xffff0000 to hold the exception
    vectors, we can use the top of that page for storing the TLS ptr at
    0xffff0ffc. This address has the advantage of fitting optimally with the
    ARM load addressing mode as follows:
    	mov	rd, #0xffff0fff
    	ldr	rd, [rd, #-3]
    Considering load scheduling, this means 2 cycles to retrieve the TLS
    value which is even faster than a coprocessor access.  Even gcc
    generates the above assembly when given:
    	void *tls = *((void **)0xffff0ffc);
    This is fine to make the vector page readable from user space since it
    contains nothing that could compromize security and doesn't require an
    extra memory page to be allocated.
    On SMP (which should be ARMv6 and above only) the special reg for
    TLS will be available.  Since ARMv6 binaries are most likely to use
    strex/ldrex insns instead of swp to implement user space atomic
    primitives, those ARMv6 binaries won't execute on pre ARMv6 processors
    anyway.  So the abscence of a tls reg is a non issue for them already.
    Also on SMP targets, since the hivec page can't be relied upon to get
    the TLS value, we'll have the kernel emulate access to it through the
    data abort vector for backward compatibility with pre ARMv6 binaries.
    Otherwise, non SMP ARMv6 kernels will support both methods
    simultaneously.
    So the decision to use hivec or tlsreg could depend on whether given
    library is optimized for ARMv6+ or not. And since ARM SMP devices are
    still far from becoming mainstream we can safely go with the hivec (and
    hivec emulation on SMP) for the time being.

    SCSI: fix HBA removal problem with transport classes
    
    James Smart pointed out that if you insert and remove a HBA driver a few
    times, eventually the system oopses.
    
    The reason is that the transport classes all kfree their attribute
    containers, but don't actually unregister them first (so we have freed
    memory on the container list).  The attached should fix this.

    [SPARC64]: __atomic_{add,sub}() must sign-extend return value.
    
    Even though we declare these functions as returning
    a 32-bit signed integer, the sparc64 ABI states that
    such functions must properly sign-extend the return
    value to the full 64-bits.
    
    Due to this bug, parts of mm/rmap.c were misbehaving
    when compiled with gcc-3.4 on sparc64.  gcc-3.4 was
    legally using a 64-bit comparison against zero with
    the return value of __atomic_add().
    
    I would like to thank Hugh Daniels and others for helping
    to track down this peculiar bug.

    CONFIG_IA64_EARLY_PRINTK bits left over in head.S, even though that
    option is long gone (replaced by console=uart etc.)
    
    While at it, I also added a "hint @pause" in the endless loop at the
    end of _start.  Not that it ever should get executed, but if it ever
    does, why waste power/cycles?

    We have a few drivers that want to include shubio.h, like mmtimer and the xp*

    [PATCH] e100 locking up netconsole.
    
    From: Steven Rostedt <rostedt@goodmis.org>
    
    If the transmit buffer of the e100 overflowed, then the system would hang.
    This was caused because the e100 driver would stop the queue, and
    netpoll_send_pkt in netpoll.c would then loop forever.  This is because the
    e100 net_poll would never start the queue again after the transmits have
    completed.
    
    For those that use the e100 and netconsole, all you need to do is a sysreq
    't' to lock up the system.

    Input: ACK/NAK processing rules in libps2 were too strict - while it is a
           good idea to discard any character other than ACK/NAK during probe
           it causes missing releases and keys getting "stuck" when a command
           issued on enabled device. The effect is easily demonstrated with
           the following command:
               while true; do xset led 3; xset -led 3; done
    
           With this change extra characters will be discarded only if device
           has not been marked as "enabled" yet.

    below, 1024 memory uncorectable errors were injected and sucessfully
    recovered on an SGI Altix test machine.  1024 is the number of entries

    [IA64] fix per-CPU MCA mess and make UP kernels work again
    
    This patch cleans up the per-CPU MCA mess with the following changes
    (and yields a UP kernel that actually boots again):
    
     - In percpu.h, make per_cpu_init() a function-call even for the
       UP case.
     - In contig.c, enable per_cpu_init() even for UP since we need to
       allocate the per-CPU MCA data in that case as well.
     - Move the MCA-related stuff out of the cpuinfo structure into
       per-CPU variables defined by mca.c.
     - Rename IA64_KR_PA_CPU_INFO to IA64_KR_PER_CPU_DATA, since it really
       is a per-CPU pointer now.
     - In mca.h, move IA64_MCA_STACK_SIZE early enough so it gets defined
       for assembly-code, too.  Tidy up struct ia64_mca_struct.  Add declaration
       of ia64_mca_cpu_init().
     - In mca_asm.[hS], replace various GET_*() macros with a single
       GET_PERCPU_ADDR() which loads the physical address of an
       arbitrary per-CPU variable.  Remove all dependencies on the
       layout of the cpuinfo structure.  Replace hardcoded stack-size
       with IA64_MCA_STACK_SIZE constant.  Replace hardcoded references
       to ar.k3 with IA64_KR(PER_CPU_DATA).
     - In setup.c:cpu_init(), initialize ar.k3 to be the physical equivalent
       of the per-CPU data pointer.
     - Nuke silly ia64_mca_cpu_t typedef and just use struct ia64_mca_cpu instead.
     - Move __per_cpu_mca[] from setup.c to mca.c.
     - Rename set_mca_pointer() to ia64_mca_cpu_init() and sanitize it.
     - Rename efi.c:pal_code_memdesc() to efi_get_pal_addr() and make it
       return the PAL address, rather than a memory-descriptor.
     - Make efi_map_pal_code() use efi_get_pal_addr().

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20050125 from Bob Moore
    
    Fixed a recently introduced problem with the Global
    Lock where the underlying semaphore was not created.
    This problem was introduced in version 20050114, and
    caused an AE_AML_NO_OPERAND exception during an Acquire()
    operation on _GL.
    
    The local object cache is now optional, and is disabled
    by default.  #define ACPI_ENABLE_OBJECT_CACHE to enable
    the local cache.
    
    Fixed an issue in the internal function
    acpi_ut_evaluate_object() concerning the optional "implicit
    return" support where an error was returned if no return
    object was expected, but one was implicitly returned. AE_OK
    is now returned in this case and the implicitly returned
    object is deleted.  acpi_ut_evaluate_object() is only
    occasionally used, and only to execute reserved methods
    such as _STA and _INI where the return type is known
    up front.
    
    Fixed a few issues with the internal convert-to-integer
    code. It now returns an error if an attempt is made to
    convert a null string, a string of only blanks/tabs, or a
    zero-length buffer. This affects both implicit conversion
    and explicit conversion via the ToInteger() operator.
    
    The internal debug code in acpi_ut_acquire_mutex()
    has been commented out. It is not needed for normal
    operation and should increase the performance of the entire
    subsystem. The code remains in case it is needed for debug
    purposes again.

    [PATCH] fix broken cross compiles
    
    The change to kbuild to use -isystem `gcc -print-file-name=include`
    broke our parisc crosscompile (and presumably everyone else's).
    
    The reason is that you have a := in the NOSTDINC_FLAGS rule, which is
    evaluated in situ (i.e.  before we've had a chance to set CROSSCOMPILE
    on CC) so the gcc include path is actually the native one not the
    crosscompiler one.  On parisc this causes us to be unable to handle
    _builtin_va functions, but I bet there are a heap of other problems.

    [XFRM]: Probe selected algorithm only.
    
    This patch removes an annoying problem in xfrm_user.  As it is every
    time an SA is added it probes every known algorithm in the universe.
    Now if they all existed it would be OK.  However, for the ones which
    don't actually exist this causes multiple /sbin/modprobe processes to
    be spawned which slows the system down when you're adding hundreds of
    SAs.
    
    Since we know the type of algorithm required when we're adding a new
    SA, we can get away with only probing the selected algorithms.  This
    is what the following patch does for xfrm_user.

    [NETFILTER]: IRC Zero Port Fix
    
    Ian Kumlien reported that new NAT code started sending out DCC
    requests with 0 as the IP address.  That prompted me to write a simple
    IRC test case, which both illustrated the bug, and found another one
    in that the wrong expectation was being set up when NAT occurred.

    [PATCH] ppc64: fix use kref for device_node refcounting (fix)
    
    The recent ppc64 patch to use kref for device_node refcounting
    introduced an unbalanced get/put in of_add_node which would cause
    newly-added device nodes to be prematurely freed.  Sorry for the
    screwup, a more rigorously tested fix follows.

    [PATCH] Include type information as module info where possible
    
    Module parameters no longer have a type in general, as we use a callback
    system (module_param_call()).  However, it's useful to include type
    information in the commonly-used wrappers: module_param,
    module_param_string and module_param_array.

    [PATCH] matroxfb: FB_MATROX_G Kconfig changes
    
    The current Kconfig entries for the Matrox G cards are quite confusing:
    
      config FB_MATROX_G450
              bool "G100/G200/G400/G450/G550 support"
              depends on FB_MATROX
    
      config FB_MATROX_G100A
              bool "G100/G200/G400 support"
              depends on FB_MATROX && !FB_MATROX_G450
    
      The patch below contains:
      - remove FB_MATROX_G100{,A} and rename FB_MATROX_G to FB_MATROX_G450
        (FB_MATROX_G450 included support from the G100 to the G550, so
         I don't see any non-historic reason why to call it G450)
      - small update for the FB_MATROX_G Kconfig text
    
      The disadvantage of this patch is, that you can no longer select support
      only for the G100-G400 without supporting the G450 and G550. But
      compared with the current confusing Kconfig setup, I don't think that's
      a big issue.

    [PATCH] intelfb: Workaround for 830M
    
    This is a work around for the 830M with intelfb.  Relative to 2.6.10.  Without
    this patch, updates to the DSPACNTR register will be ignored.
    
    On the 830M, the display plane needs to be enabled before writing to any of
    the other bits in the DSPACNTR register.
    
    This patch detects the specific case, temporarily enables the plane, updates
    the register, and then disables the plane.  It also appears to require some
    settling time, but not an entire frame's time.
    
    Without this change, the pixel format fields in DSPACNTR won't get written on
    the 830M.

    [PATCH] vesafb: Change return error id
    
    With <Stuart_Hayes@Dell.com>
    
    I'm getting a message in dmesg: "localhost kernel: vesafb: probe of vesafb0
    failed with error -6"
    
    I searched the web, and found that a lot of people are getting this, but I
    couldn't find an answer, so I looked into it.
    
    This appears to be because "vesafb" returns -ENXIO ("No such device or
    address") when its probe function fails.  However, driverse/base/bus.c spews
    an error message during device_attach() if a matching driver's probe function
    returns anything but -ENODEV ("No such device").

    Linus said:
    But the right thing is definitely to make an IO port pointer be
    "unsigned int" or even "unsigned long".

    The cap_mask_mutex needs to be initialized before ib_register_device(),

    Saving/setting CR0 plus a clts instruction are too expensive for it to ever be
    a win, and the config option was just confusing.

    [PATCH] InfiniBand/mthca: clean up ioremap()/request_region() usage
    
    From: "Michael S. Tsirkin" <mst@mellanox.co.il>
    
    Here are misc fixes for mthca mapping:
    
    1. Thinkably, MSI tables or another region could fall between HCR
       and ECR tables.
       Thus its arguably wrong to map both tables in one region.
       So, do it separately.
       I think its also more readable to have ecr_base and access ecr there,
       not access ecr with hcr pointer.
    
    2. mthca_request_regions error handling was borken
       (wrong order of cleanups). For example on all errors
       pci_release_region was called which is wrong if the region
       was not yet mapped. And other such cleanups.
    
    3. Fixed some error messages too.

     - Only read ECR once.  If a new event occurs while we're in the

    [PATCH] ext2/ext3 ACLs: remove the number of acl entries limit
    
    This patch removes the arbitrary limit of 32 acl entries on ext[23] when
    writing acls.  A patch that removes the same check when reding acls is in
    BK since 12 March 2004, so all kernels since then are already able to read
    large acls.  I think that ten+ months are enough so that we can now also
    remove the write limit.
    
    This is the read-limit patch:
    http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/cset%404051e2863UsuQEgAQShmimgBooAXkg?nav=index.html
    
    Even without this patch the xattr block could already contain less space
    than needed for the acl, because other attributes might already use up
    almost all space.  So this patch does not introduce additional error
    conditions.  We have been shipping with this patch the last year (almost).

    [PATCH] ext3: fix ea-in-inode default ACL creation
    
    When a new inode is created, ext3_new_inode sets the EXT3_STATE_NEW flag,
    which tells ext3_do_update_inode to zero out the inode before filling in
    the inode's data.  When a file is created in a directory with a default
    acl, the new inode inherits the directory's default acl; this generates
    attributes.  The attributes are created before ext3_do_update_inode is
    called to write out the inode.  In case of in-inode attributes, the new
    inode's attributes are written, and then zeroed out again by
    ext3_do_update_inode.  Bad thing.
    
    Fix this by recognizing the EXT3_STATE_NEW case in ext3_xattr_set_handle,
    and zeroing out the inode there already when necessary.

    [PATCH] ext3/ea: ix i_extra_isize check
    
    We are checking for (EXT3_SB(inode->i_sb)->s_inode_size <=
    EXT3_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE) to find out if we can set in-inode attributes;
    the test fails for inodes that have been created before the ea-in-inode
    patch.  Those inodes have (i_extra_isize == 0), so we end up with the
    attributes overlapping the i_extra_isize field.  Checking for
    (i_extra_isize == 0) instead fixes this case.
    
    The EXT3_STATE_XATTR flag is only set if (i_extra_isize > 0) and the inodes
    has in-inode attributes, so that is enough in the first two tests.

    [PATCH] ext3/ea: no lock needed when freeing inode
    
    ext3_xattr_delete_inode is called from ext3_free_inode which always has
    exclusive access to the inode, so there is no need to take the xattr

    [PATCH] ext2/ext3: block allocator startup fix
    
    We found strange blocks layout in our mail server, after careful study, we
    got the reason and tried to fix it.
    
    On the very fist attempt to allocate a block to the newly-initialised inode,
    if we are trying to add a block at logical file offset "1" then
    ext2_find_goal() will incorrectly assume that this was a next_alloc_block
    cache hit (because we think the previously-allocated block was at offset
    zero).
    
    Net result: why trying to extend a freshly-opened one-block file we end up
    deciding to place the second file block at disk block "1", rather than going
    off and calling ext2_find_near().
    
    Fix it by checking that we actually do have something valid cached in
    next_alloc_goal.

    [PATCH] x86: no interrupts from secondary CPUs until officially online
    
    Andi Kleen reported a problem where a very slow boot caused the timer
    interrupt on a secondary CPU to go off before the CPU was actually brought
    up by the core code, so the CPU_PREPARE notifier hadn't been called, so the
    per-cpu timer code wasn't set up.
    
    This was caused by enabling interrupts around calibrate_delay() on
    secondary CPUs, which is not actually neccessary (interrupts on CPU 0
    increments jiffies, which is all that is required).  So delay enabling
    interrupts until the actual __cpu_up() call for that CPU.

    [PATCH] ppc64: use kref for device_node refcounting
    
    This patch is from Nathan Lynch <nathanl@austin.ibm.com>.
    
    This changes struct device_node and associated code to use the kref api for
    object refcounting and freeing.  I've given it some testing on pSeries with
    cpu add/remove and verified that the release function works.  The change is
    somewhat cosmetic but it does make the code easier to understand...  at least
    I think so =)
    
    The only real change is that the refcount on all device_nodes is initialized
    at 1, and the device node is freed when the refcount reaches 0 (of_remove_node
    has the extra "put" to ensure that this happens).  This lets us get rid of the
    OF_STALE flag and macros in prom.h.

    [PATCH] ppc64: clear MSR_RI earlier in syscall exit path
    
    This patch is from Craig Chaney <cchaney@us.ibm.com>.
    
    This patch moves the restoring of the stack pointer in the system call exit
    path to after the point where we clear the RI (recoverable interrupt) bit in
    the MSR.  Normally, loading the stack pointer before clearing RI doesn't cause
    any problem because there is no trap that can normally occur in between.  But
    if we are tracing the code using a tool that single-steps instructions, this
    can cause a problem.  In this case, clearing RI serves as an indication that
    the following code can't be safely single-stepped.

    [PATCH] ppc64: fix in_be64 definition
    
    This patch is from Jake Moilanen <moilanen@austin.ibm.com>.
    
    The instruction syntax for the in_be64 inline asm was incorrect for the "m"
    constraint for the address parameter.  This patch fixes the instruction in the
    inline asm.

    On PPC64 systems with a hypervisor, we can't set the Data Address Breakpoint

    The ppc pci bus and resource fixups will automatically adjust the IO space

    space (PCI1 & PCI2) with a single mapping so it is continguious in virtual,
    physical, and PCI IO space the offset will equal MPC85XX_PCI1_IO_SIZE.
    There for we needed to reduce the setting by that amount for everything to

    [PATCH] mm: adjust dirty threshold for lowmem-only mappings
    
    With Rik van Riel <riel@redhat.com>
    
    Simply running "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hd<one you can miss>" can cause
    excessive amounts of dirty lowmem pagecache, due to the blockdev's
    non-highmem page allocation strategy.
    
    This patch effectively lowers the dirty limit for mappings which cannot be
    cached in highmem, counting the dirty limit as a percentage of lowmem
    instead.  This should prevent heavy block device writers from pushing the
    VM over the edge and triggering OOM kills.

    [PATCH] oprofile: falling back on timer interrupt mode
    
    When some hardware setups or architectures do not allow OProfile to use
    performance counters, OProfile operates in timer mode.
    
    But, from 2.6.11-rc1, we need to specify the module parameter "timer=1" to
    work on timer interrupt mode.  Change things so that we detect the absence of
    the high-resolution timer and fall back to timer-based profiling
    automatically.
    
    Furthermore we can easily get oops by reading /dev/oprofile/cpu_type.

    NTFS: Add printk rate limiting for ntfs_warning() and ntfs_error() when
          compiled without debug.  This avoids a possible denial of service
          attack.  Thanks to Carl-Daniel Hailfinger from SuSE for pointing this

    [PATCH] removing bcopy... because it's half broken
    
    Nothing in the kernel is using bcopy right know, and that is a good thing.
    Why? Because a lot of the architectures implement a broken bcopy()....
    the userspace standard bcopy() is basically a memmove() with a weird
    parameter order, however a bunch of architectures implement a memcpy() not a
    memmove().
    
    Instead of fixing this inconsistency, I decided to remove it entirely,
    explicit memcpy() and memmove() are prefered anyway (welcome to the 1990's)
    and nothing in the kernel is using these functions, so this saves code size
    as well for everyone.

    The fix for socket unlink race introduced a deadlock in the RFCOMM

    dead lock. So the DLC lock must be dropped first and claimed again

    [Bluetooth] Fix too many keys pressed error
    
    This patch fixes the problem of keys repeating when too many keys
    are pressed at the same time (e.g. when typing quickly). This
    often results in "mount" becoming "mouount".
    
    It seems that Bluetooth keyboards send a HID report with the keys
    all set to 0x01 if too many keys were pressed at the same time.
    This confuses the previous report handling logic and now these
    reports are ignored.

    [ARM PATCH] 2431/1: Split arch specifics out of arch/arm/kernel/debug.S
    
    Patch from Ben Dooks
    
    This patch moves all the machine/arch specific bits out of
    arch/arm/kernel/debug.S and places them into the include
    directories for those given architectures. The debug macros
    are placed into include/asm-arm/arch-*/debug-macro.S.
    The aim is to clean-up the debug.S code and make it easier to
    modify a single-architecture without affecting the entire
    debug.S file.
    The patch also removes CONFIG_ARCH_FTVPCI, which no longer
    exists anywhere else in the kernel.
    All new include files have the original copyright notice
    from arch/arm/kernel/debug.S.
    Note, not all architectures modified here have been built
    and/or tested due to lack of available machines, or
    problems building for them (no defconfig available, or
    problems with kernel build).

    [PATCH] i386/x86-64: Fix ioremap off by one
    
    From Terence Ripperda <tripperda@nvidia.com>
    
    When doing iounmap don't try to change_page_attr back the guard
    page that ioremap added.
    
    Since the last round of change_page_attr changes this would
    trigger an BUG because the reference count on the changed pages
    wouldn't match up.
    
    The problem would be only visible on machines with >3GB of memory,
    because only then the PCI memory hole is below end_pfn and
    change_page_attr is used.
    
    Fixed for both i386 and x86-64.
    
    This was actually discovered&fixed by Andrea earlier, but I goofed up
    while doing the last ioremap fixes merge and this change got lost.
    Poor Terence had to debug it again. Sorry about that.

    [IA64] irq handling cleanup
    
    Patch from Christoph Hellwig to:
    - irq_desc and irq_to_vector machvecs.  SN2 has it's own versions,
      but they're the same as the generic ones
    - kill do do_IRQ and use __do_IRQ directly everywhere
    - kill dead X86 ifdefs
    - move some variable declarations around in irq.c to recuce # of ifdefs

    [IA64] remove superfluous layer from sn2 DMA API
    
    When I converted the sn2 code over to the new DMA API, I left the old routines
    in place and added wrappers to call them from the generic DMA API functions.
    This added an unnecessary level of obfuscation since the generic ia64 code
    calls those functions when any of the old style PCI DMA API functions are
    called.  This patch rectifies the problem making the code much easier to
    understand and hopefully a little more efficient (though I'm sure gcc was
    already inlining things pretty well, there were a bunch of unnecessary checks
    that I took this opportunity to remove).  It also shrinks the size of the sn2
    pci_dma.c quite a bit.

    [IA64] fix early SAL init for sn2
    
    sn2 does early initialization of the SAL so it can use it for early console
    support.  Unfortunately, the loop to find the SAL entry point was buggy so
    when we tried out new EFI and SAL system table layouts, the loop didn't
    terminate.  Here's the fix (doh!, use two different loop counters instead of
    one and just return if we find the SAL entry point).

    [IA64] new api efi_range_is_wc()
    
    Ok, here you go Tony.  This one fixes the loop and also fixes drm_vm.c.  All
    of the bits aside from the efi.h bit are ia64 specific (either under
    arch/ia64 or __ia64__), so your tree is probably the right place for all of
    it.
    
    This patch adds efi_range_is_wc() to efi.h.  It's used to determine whether an
    address range can be mapped with the write coalescing attribute.  It also
    fixes up some ia64 specific callers to use the new routine instead of
    unconditionally calling pgprot_writecombined, which can be dangerous if used
    on ranges that don't support it.

    [IA64] entry.S: perfmon psr.pp fix
    
    Problem:
    	There exists a case where we stop monitoring, i.e. clear
    	psr.pp/dcr.pp, via IPI. This is when the stop is triggered
    	by a close(), either explicit in the application or implicit
    	via exit_files(). The IPI is necessary because at the time the
    	thread (controlling the context) issues a close() it may not run
    	on the CPU the context is bound to. Yet the call must succeed,
    	hence we need to propagate the call to the right CPU.
    	But what is the problem then?
    	Under IPI, we invoke a perfmon routine which clear the kernel
    	(live) kernel psr.pp bit and also dcr.pp. Then we return from
    	the function and execute the kernel exit path which restores
    	the interrupted state. Unfortunately, this restores the kernel
    	psr from ipsr which now contains a stale value. Therefore
    	monitoring in the kernel will be active even though we stopped it.
    	You cannot modify the "global" psr in an interrupt routine because
    	it will be systematically restored on the way back.
    
    Solution:
    	We need to patch ipsr.pp in the kernel exit path to reflect the
    	kernel value of the kernel psr.pp bit. This must be done only when
    	returning to kernel.
    
    	The proposed patch does patch ipsr.pp such that it is identical
    	to psr.pp. The patch is subtle because the exit path does not have
    	a lot of free registers and also because we need to schedule for
    	a psr read. I had to shuffle  things around a little bit.
    
    	The patch is important because there will be another situation where
    	this problem can occur once we incorporate the support for event set
    	and multiplexing. In this configuration, you may be in the middle of
    	the idle loop and on a timer interrupt, you may stop monitoring.
    	Slightly different condition, yet same problem with ipsr.pp vs. psr.pp.
    
    
    Changelog:
    	- update kernel exit path when returning to kernel to copy
    	psr.pp to ipsr.pp. This is necesary to ensure that if psr.pp
    	was modified during the kernel entry, the change is propagated
    	the the psr.pp of the of the interrupted thread. Psr.pp can
    	be modified as a consequence of an IPI under certain conditions,
    	such as when a system-wide context is closed from a remote CPU.
    
    Special thanks to David for reworking the patch to fit
    into the enhanced exit path.

    When compiling for non-NUMA variable "node" ended up not being used,

    in place.  This has the effect of doing cpu_to_node(i) twice on NUMA,
    but this is init code, so performance is not an issue (and even if
    it were, you can just declare cpu_to_node() as being a pure function,
    so the compiler can eliminate the second call).

    [PATCH] PPC64: fix stack alignment for signal handlers
    
    The PPC64 ABI specifies that the stack should be kept aligned to 16
    bytes.  However, signal handlers on PPC64 are getting run with the stack
    misaligned (sp % 16 == 8).  This patch fixes that by ensuring that the
    signal frame allocated is a multiple of 16 bytes.
    
    In addition to the PPC64 signal frame itself being of misaligned size,
    the explicit alignment of the starting stack pointer is also to 8
    instead of 16.  I've corrected this as well, so signal frames are
    aligned even if the interrupted registers contained a misaligned stack
    pointer.

    [ Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org> acked the original patch (which
      also did it for the 32-bit cases), and pointed out that the 32-bit
      cases all already did the alignment elsewhere and didn't need this.
      Patch edited down accordingly. ]

    [PATCH] Fix x86-64 vsyscall32 mapping
    
    The x86-64 kernel incorrectly marks the 32-bit vsyscall page mapping at
    virtual address 0xffffe000 as a global one, even though that mapping
    does not exist globally.  As such, task switches do not correctly
    invalidate the mapping, and strange behaviour ensues if a 64-bit program
    happens to use that same virtual address for something else.

    [PATCH] fat: reserved clusters cleanup
    
    - Replaces the "number of reserved clusters" by FAT_START_ENT.
    
    - The ->clusters is total number of clusters. Instead of it, use the
      maximum cluster number (->max_cluster).
    
      By this change, removes the some "->clusters + 2" calculation.
    
    - Adds inline function for cluster to block number conversion. And
      replaces the open-coding for it.

    decreased by this patch.  And IMHO the code gets more readable, too.
    
    The terms (base->valid && ext->valid), (ext->lower || ext->upper) and
    (base->lower || base->upper) are trivially found to be true at the single
    callsite of shortname_info_to_lcase().  The relevant lines are included in
    this patch file.

    [PATCH] Some fixes for compat ioctl
    
    While doing some compat_ioctl conversions I noticed a few issues in
    compat_sys_ioctl:
    
    - It is not completely compatible to old ->ioctl because the traditional
      common ioctls are not checked before it.  I added a check for those.  The
      main advantage is that the handler now works the same as a traditional
      handler even when it returns -EINVAL
    
    - The private socket ioctl check should only apply for sockets.
    
    - There was a security hook missing.  Drawback is that it uses the same
      hook now, and the LSM module cannot distingush between 32bit and 64bit
      clients.  But it'll have to live with that for now.

    [PATCH] completion API additions
    
    Adds 3 new completion API calls, which are a straightforward extension of
    the current APIs:
    
     int wait_for_completion_interruptible(struct completion *x);
     unsigned long wait_for_completion_timeout(struct completion *x,
                                                       unsigned long timeout);
     unsigned long wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout(
                            struct completion *x, unsigned long timeout);
    
    This enables the conversion of more semaphore-using code to completions.
    There is code that cannot be converted right now (and is forced to use
    semaphores) because these primitives are missing.  Thomas Gleixner has a
    bunch of patches to make use of them.

    [PATCH] Use -Wno-pointer-sign for gcc 4.0
    
    Compiling an allyesconfig kernel straight with a gcc 4.0 snapshot gives
    nearly 10k new warnings like:
    
    warning: pointer targets in passing argument 5 of `cpuid' differ in signedness
    
    Since the sheer number of these warnings was too much even for the most
    determined kernel janitors (I actually asked ;-) and I don't think it's a
    very serious issue to have these mismatches I submitted an new option to
    gcc to disable it.  It was incorporated in gcc mainline now.
    
    This patch makes the kernel compilation use it.  There are still quite a
    lot of new warnings with 4.0 (mostly about uninitialized variables), but
    the compile log looks much nicer nnow.

    [PATCH] consolidate arch specific resource.h headers
    
    Most of the include/asm-*/resource.h headers are the same as one another.
    This patch makes one generic version, include/asm-generic/resource.h, and
    uses that when appropriate.  The only vaguely interesting things here are
    that the generic version introduces a new _STK_LIM_MAX macro, which can be
    populated by an arch (ia64 and parisc needed that).  Also, some arches hid
    RLIM_INFINITY under __KERNEL__, while others did not.  The generic version
    does not, so the following arches will see that change:
    
        arm, arm26, mips, ppc, ppc64, sh (and hence sh64)
    
    And, finally, some arches maintain their own order for the resource
    numbers.  This is now marked by __ARCH_RLIMIT_ORDER, and is used by the
    following arches:
    
        alpha, mips, sparc, and sparc64.
    
    This actually uncovered a mips bug (fix already sent, this patch is
    relative to that fix), where the default RLIMIT_MEMLOCK was set to
    RLIM_INFINITY and RLIMIT_NPROC set to MLOCK_LIMIT (the latter is no big
    deal because RLIMIT_NPROC default is overwritten dynamically during bootup
    in fork_init()).  Also, this change makes alpha's default for RLIMIT_NPROC
    change from RLIM_INFINITY to 0, but again...no problem as it's dynamically
    overwritten during bootup.
    
    The following arches are left untouched:
        m68knommu: untouched (uses m68k/resource.h)
        sh64: untouched (uses asm-sh/resource.h)
        um: untouched (uses arch code already)

    [PATCH] vgacon fixes to help font restauration in X11
    
    So far the X.Org/XFree86 Xservers use internal functions to perform
    saving/restoring of console fonts.  This doesn't work under all
    circumstances and has disadvantages:
    
    1. On some platforms (IA64) X needs to POST the BIOS before
       it even has a chance to access the hardware itself. This POSTing
       will usually undo any changes to the graphics hardware that the
       kernel may have done.
    2. More and more drivers fully rely on BIOS support. However
       the BIOS functions which could be used to save/restore
       register settings may be broken so the only way of mode
       save/restore is getting/setting the BIOS mode ID.
       This will restore the BIOSes default fonts, not the custom font
       that the user may have loaded.
    
    I would like to utilize the kernel's save/restore console fonts ioctls to
    save/restore the text mode console fonts from inside X.
    
    The patch does two things:
    
    1. Eliminates the optimization that returns from vgacon_adjust_height()
       early (without reprogramming the HW) when the hight of the font hasn't
       changed.
    2. Resets the stored 'from' and 'to' lines for the text cursor in
       vgacon_adjust_height() to cause vgacon_set_cursor_size() reprogram
       the textcursor start and end line.
    
    These are necessary to sanitize the HW in case something other than the
    kernel has changed the register values without restoring them properly.
    
    I'm fully aware that in the long run we will need to look into a new driver
    model for graphics where no two instances fight over who gets register
    access.  However such a model won't be created nor will we get the majority
    of the drivers ported over night.  Therefore we need to find an interim
    solution for the most pressing problems.

    [PATCH] move read-only and immutable checks into permission()
    
    Currently it's up to the filesystem ->permission method to check whether
    the filesystem is readonly or the file marked immutable.  But this is
    really a VFS decision, and the distintion becomes more important when
    moving to per-mountpoint read only flags.
    
    For most filesystems that have been using generic_permission this is not
    change in behaviour.  For those that we're missing the check (cifs without
    CIFS_MOUNT_NO_PERM and coda [1]) this is a bugfix.
    
    Both reiserfs and xfs have this check still in their ->permission routine
    because they call it from other places aswell.  I'll try switching them
    over to generic_permission and will take care of this one.
    
    [1] coda_ioctl_permission always returns 0, aka always grants access,
        which looks more than fishy to me.

    [PATCH] file_table:expand_files() code cleanup
    
    expand_files() cleanup: Make expand_files() common code for
    fork.c:fork/copy_files(), open.c:open/get_unused_fd() and
    fcntl.c:dup/locate_fd().
    
    expand_files() does both expand_fd_array and expand_fd_set based on the
    need.  This is used in dup().  open() and fork() duplicates the work of
    expand files.  At all places we check for expanding fd array, we also check
    for expanding fdset.  There is no need of checking and calling them
    seperately.
    
    This change also moves the expand_files to file.c from fcntl.c, and makes
    the expand_fd_array and expand_fd_set local to that file.

    [PATCH] i386/x86-64: Fix SMP NMI watchdog race
    
    Fix SMP race in NMI watchdog on i386/x86-64
    
    Fix a long standing SMP Setup race in the NMI watchdog.  The watchdog would
    tick from very early and check if all CPUs increase their timer interrupts.
    For that it would check the cpu_online_map.  Now if a CPU took too long to
    boot the watchdog would trigger prematurely because the CPU didn't increase
    its timer count yet.
    
    Fix is to check cpu_callin_map instead of cpu_online_map because the first is
    only set when a CPU started its timer interrupt.
    
    I fixed it on i386 and x86-64.

    [PATCH] x86_64: fix flush race on context switch
    
    Fix a long standing race in x86-64 SMP TLB handling.  When a mm is freed and
    another thread exits to a lazy TLB thread (like idle) the freed user page
    tables would be still kept loaded in the idle thread.  When an interrupt does
    a prefetch on NULL the CPU would try to follow it and read random data.
    
    This could lead to machine checks on Opterons in some cases.
    
    Credit goes to some unnamed debugging wizards at AMD who described the
    problem.  All blame to me.  I did the fix based on their description.

    Currently, this code involves some calls to match a pci_dev from the open
    firmware node and such things that are causing some problems with the
    latest version of my sungem driver who wants to do some of this in atomic
    contexts.
    
    This patch moves that to a list of struct device_node instead, which also
    ends up simplifying the code.
    
    Later, I'll go back to manipulating PCI devices in a clean way when Brian
    King's PCI blocking patch gets in, but only after I change sungem again to
    never call these in atomic context.  This is a 3 step transition basically

    [PATCH] ppc64: Remove CONFIG_IRQ_ALL_CPUS
    
    Replace CONFIG_IRQ_ALL_CPUS with a boot option (noirqdistrib).  Compile
    options arent much use on a distro kernel.  This also removes the ppc64 use
    of smp_threads_ready.
    
    I considered removing the option completely but we have had problems in the
    past with firmware bugs.  In those cases the boot option would have helped.

    [PATCH] ppc32: update_process_times simplification
    
    When the update_process_times call was moved out of do_timer for the UP case,
    the replicator didn't track down the hiding and just added ifndef SMP.
    
    This removes the ifdefs and the indirection of calling another file for one
    function in a third file.
    
    I also removed the per-cpu multipler and counter.  On some architectures (x86
    and sparc64) these are set via /proc/profile setup_profiling_timer to increase
    the timer interrupt by a factor over HZ.  However, this was not not
    implemented for ppc (like several other architectures), so it was just
    decrementing, testing, and setting per-cpu variables back to 1.

    [PATCH] ppc32: MPC8xx TLB Miss vs TLB Error fix
    
    There is a problem in the TLB Miss (and Error, as they jump to the Miss
    handler) handlers.  The problem is that when an app spans more than one L1
    entry, we don't have all of the correct information, and do_page_fault()
    things a protection fault happened, when it didn't really.  The fix for this
    is to modify the handlers slightly to force a TLB Error in this case.

    [PATCH] ppc32: System platform_device description, discovery and management
    
    On most embedded PPC systems we either have a core CPU and chipset (MPC10x,
    TSI10x, Marvell, etc.) or a system-on-chip device (4xx, 8xx, 82xx, 85xx,
    etc.).  Some of these sub-archs have been using the On Chip Peripheral
    (OCP) driver model.  The functionality that OCP provide has been replaced
    by the generic driver model and platform_device.  Also, some of these
    device may exist across a number of architectures (PPC, MIPS, ARM) such
    that some information that is shared between the architecture and driver
    needs to exist outside of either.
    
    The ppc_sys changes add a standard way for PowerPC systems to describe the
    devices and systems that exist in the sub-arch.  Additionally, we are able
    to discover which system we are and manage which devices are actually
    registered and any platform specific fixups that may be needed.

    [PATCH] Fix audit control message checks
    
    The audit control messages are sent over netlink.  Permission checks are
    done on the process receiving the message, which may not be the same as the
    process sending the message.  This patch switches the netlink_send security
    hooks to calculate the effective capabilities based on the sender.  Then
    audit_receive_msg performs capability checks based on that.
    
    It also introduces the CAP_AUDIT_WRITE and CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL capabilities,
    and replaces the previous CAP_SYS_ADMIN checks in audit code with the
    appropriate checks.
    
    - Simplified dummy_netlink_send given that dummy now keeps track of
      capabilities.
    
    - Many fixes based on feedback from <linux-audit@redhat.com> list.
    
    - Removed the netlink_msg_type helper function.
    
    - Switch to using CAP_AUDIT_WRITE and CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL.

    This is a patch to generic_file_buffered_write() to correctly

    	writing 4k to offset 4k

    The result is that 8k write writes the 1st 4k of the buffer twice.

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20050114 from Bob Moore
    
    Added 2005 copyright to all ACPICA files.
    
    Fixed an issue with the String-to-Buffer conversion code
    where the string null terminator was not included in the
    buffer after conversion, but there is existing ASL that
    assumes the string null terminator is included. This is the
    root of the ACPI_AML_BUFFER_LIMIT regression. This problem
    was introduced in the previous version when the code was
    updated to correctly set the converted buffer size as per
    the ACPI specification. The ACPI spec is ambiguous and
    will be updated to specify that the null terminator must
    be included in the converted buffer. This also affects
    the ToBuffer() ASL operator.
    
    Fixed a problem with the Mid() ASL/AML operator where it
    did not work correctly on Buffer objects. Newly created
    sub-buffers were not being marked as initialized.
    
    Fixed a problem in acpi_tb_find_table where incorrect string
    compares were performed on the oem_id and oem_table_d table
    header fields.  These fields are not null terminated,
    so strncmp is now used instead of strcmp.
    
    Implemented a restriction on the Store() ASL/AML operator
    to align the behavior with the ACPI specification.
    Previously, any object could be used as the source
    operand.  Now, the only objects that may be used are
    Integers, Buffers, Strings, Packages, Object References,
    and DDB Handles.  As acpi_gbl_enable_interpreter_slack
    is FALSE by default, "acpi=strict" is needed to enable
    this check.
    
    Enhanced the optional "implicit return" support to allow
    an implicit return value from methods that are invoked
    externally via the AcpiEvaluateObject interface.  This
    enables implicit returns from the _STA and _INI methods,
    for example.
    
    Changed the Revision() ASL/AML operator to return the
    current version of the AML interpreter, in the YYYYMMDD
    format. Previously, it incorrectly returned the supported
    ACPI version (This is the function of the _REV method).
    
    Updated the _REV predefined method to return the currently
    supported version of ACPI, now 3.

    [NET]: Close NETIF_F_LLTX race conditions.
    
    When drivers other than loopback were using the LLTX
    feature a race window was present.  While sending
    queued packets, the packet scheduler layer drops the
    queue lock then calls directly into the drivers xmit
    handler.  The driver then grabs it's private TX lock
    and goes to work.
    
    However, as soon as we've dropped the queue lock another
    thread doing TX processing for that card can execute
    a netif_stop_queue() due to the TX queue filling up.
    This race window causes problems because a properly coded
    driver should never end up in it's ->hard_start_xmit()
    handler if the queue on the device has been stopped and
    we even BUG() trap for this condition in all of the device
    drivers.  That is how this race window was discovered
    by Roland and the Infiniband folks.
    
    Various suggestions were made to close this race.  One
    of which involved holding onto the queue lock all the
    way into the ->hard_start_xmit() routine.  Then having
    the driver drop that lock only after taking it's private
    TX lock.  This solution was deemed grotty because it is
    not wise to put queueing discipline internals into the
    device drivers.
    
    The solution taken here, which is based upon ideas from
    Stephen Hemminger, is twofold:
    
    1) Leave LLTX around for purely software devices that
       need no locking at all for TX processing.  The existing
       example is loopback, although all tunnel devices could
       be converted in this way too.
    
    2) Stop trying to use LLTX for the other devices.  Instead
       achieve the same goal using a different mechanism.
    
    For #2, the thing we were trying to achieve with LLTX
    was to eliminate excess locking.  We accomplish that
    now by letting the device driver use dev->xmit_lock directly
    instead of a seperate priv->tx_lock of some sort.
    
    In order to allow that, we had to turn dev->xmit_lock into
    a hardware IRQ disabling lock instead of a BH disabling one.

    [IPV6]: IPoIB link addr option needs two byte pad.
    
    Anand Parthasarathy pointed out that draft-ietf-ipoib-ip-over-infiniband-09.txt says:
    
                [DISC] specifies the length of source/target option in
                number of 8-octets as indicated by a length of '3' above.
                Since the IPoIB link-layer address is only 20-octet long,
                two octets of zero MUST be prepended to fill the total
                option length of 24 octets.
    
    The current Linux neighbour discovery code puts the padding after the
    link address.  This patch fixes up ndisc.c to put the padding in the
    correct place by adding a general ndisc_addr_option_pad() function
    (which could be used in the future if someone ever implements RFC 3831
    IPv6-over-FC or some other encapsulation that requires padding).

    move the SCSI transport classes over to the generic transport class
    
    This converts the three transport classes (SPI, FC and iSCSI) over to
    the generic transport class code.
    
    It also converts the internals of the SCSI mid-layer to use generic
    transport class trigger points and pulls out some of the duplicated code.

    add a generic device transport class
    
    Transport classes are a mechanism for providing transport specific
    services to drivers that the more generic command processing layers
    don't care about.  A good example is the SCSI mid-layer not caring about
    parallel transfer characteristics or providing services for domain
    validation.  Transport classes usually provide a transport specific API
    at one end and a class interface at the other (for the user to
    interrogate and set parameters).
    
    Originally, transport classes were SCSI specific.  However, this code is
    generic to the device model.  As long as you have a generic device
    representing a storage interface (or device) then you can attach a
    transport class to it.  The new code also allows an arbitrary number of
    transport classes to be attached to a device, unlike SCSI which only
    allowed one.  This is going to be important for things like SATA and SAS
    which share the PHY layer (and hence should be capable of sharing a PHY
    transport class).
    
    The generic transport class is designed to operate identically to the
    current SCSI transport classes, except that it uses generic devices
    rather than SCSI devices.
    
    We have five events:
    
     setup
     add
     -----
     configure
     -----
     remove
     destroy
    
    With callbacks for setup configure and remove.
    
    There's also an anonymous transport class which can only respond to
    configure events (and which has no attributes).

    [NETFILTER]: Get rid of 'initialized' in nat structure: use conntrack status bits
    
    Fairly simple patch to move the 'initialized' NAT bitfield to bits in
    the 'status' word.  This saves the size of a pointer from the
    connection tracking structure.

    [NETFILTER]: Use a bit in conntrack status to indicate sequence number adjustment
    
    Rather than calling the sequence adjustment code on every connection
    which has a helper, we can set a status bit on the conntrack when we
    change the length of a TCP packet, and use that to indicate that we
    should call the routine.

    [PATCH] Fix reference to deallocated memory in sd.c
    
    This patch:
    
    http://linux-scsi.bkbits.net:8080/scsi-for-linus-2.6/cset@1.2034.95.5?nav=index.html|src/|src/drivers|src/drivers/scsi|related/drivers/scsi/sd.c
    
    is causing almost as much trouble as it fixed.  If kref_put() drops the
    last reference to the scsi_disk (this happens when the device file is
    closed after the device has been hot-unplugged) then the call to
    scsi_device_put() will take its argument from an area of memory that has
    been deallocated.

    [NETFILTER]: Remove ip_conntrack_tuple_hash 'ctrack' pointer
    
    We keep a pointer from the hash table entry into the connection
    tracking entry it's a part of.  However, there's a spare byte in the
    hash entry anyway, which we can use to indicate which of the two
    tuples it is, and the simply use container_of() to access the
    conntrack.
    
    This saves two pointers per connection tracking entry.

    [NETFILTER]: Remove manip array from conntrack entry
    
    Original patch and multo bugfixes by Krisztian Kovacs.
    
    Now NAT has been simplified, there is only one place to NAT each
    packet.  That means we can intuit what to do by looking at the
    difference between this packet and the reply we expect, getting rid of
    the manips[] array in the connection tracking structure, which is 72
    bytes.  Rework NAT to be based on 'change this packet to make src/dst
    look like this tuple'.
    
    1) Each protocol's manip_pkt takes a 'struct ip_conntrack_manip',
       which is half (the source half) of a tuple.  Hand the whole desired
       tuple to the NAT code and have it use the 'maniptype' arg to decide
       what part to copy.
    
    2) Krisztian points out that we don't need the NAT lock to read the
       NAT information (or the tuples) as they never change once set, and
       while being set we have exclusive access.  A lock is only needed to
       deal with only remaining NAT list: the bysource hash.
    
    3) We don't need to rehash for the bysource hash: it depends on the
       incoming packet, which we can't change.
    
    4) Many NAT functions only need the maniptype they are to perform, not
       the actual hook, which makes the code clearer.
    
    5) New status bits to indicate what NAT needs to be done.  We can
       always figure it out by inverting the tuple we expect in the other
       direction and comparing it, but this is faster.
    
    6) Rename 'do_bindings' to 'nat_packet'.
    
    7) ICMP handing is vastly simplified: we unconditionally change to
       look the way we want.

    [NETFILTER]: Simplify expect handling
    
    Now we've changed expect handling, we can simplify it significantly.
    
    1) struct ip_conntrack_expect only exists until the connection
       matching it is created.  Now NAT is done directly at the time the
       expectation is matched, we don't need to keep this information
       around.
    
    2) The term 'master' is used everywhere to mean the connection that
       expected this connection.  The 'master' field in the new connection
       points straight to the master connection, and holds a reference.
    
    3) There is no direct link from the connection to the expectations it
       has created: we walk the global list to find them if we need to
       clean them up.  Each expectation holds a reference.
    
    4) The ip_conntrack_expect_tuple_lock is now a proper subset of
       ip_conntrack_lock, so we can eliminate it.
    
    5) Remove flags from helper: the policy of evicting the oldest
       expectation seems to be appropriate for everyone.
    
    6) ip_conntrack_expect_find_get() and ip_conntrack_expect_put() are no
       longer required.
    
    7) Remove reference count from expectations, and don't free when we
       fail ip_conntrack_expect_related(): have user call
       ip_conntrack_expect_free().

    [NETFILTER]: Call NAT helper modules directly from conntrack modules, fixup FTP
    
    Currently connection tracking and NAT helper modules for a protocol
    interact only indirectly (the conntrack module places information in
    the conntrack structure, which the NAT module pulls out).
    
    This leads to several issues:
    1) Both modules must know what port to watch, and must match.
    2) Identifying the particular packet which created the connection
       is cumbersome (TCP) or impossible (UDP).
    3) The connection tracking code sets up an expectation which the
       NAT code then has to change.
    4) The lack of direct symbol dependencies means we have to contrive
       one, since they are functionally dependent.
    
    Here is the current code flow:
    FTP CONTROL PACKET:
    NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING:
       ip_conntrack_in
          resolve_normal_ct
             init_conntrack: sets ct->helper to ip_conntrack_ftp.c:help()
       ct->help(): if PORT/PASV command:
          Sets exp->help.exp_ftp_info to tcp seq number of data.
          ip_conntrack_expect(): expects the connection
    
       ip_nat_setup_info: sets ct->nat.info->helper to ip_nat_ftp.c:help()
       ip_nat_fn:
          proto->exp_matches_pkt: if packet matches expectation
          ct->nat.info->helper(): If packet going client->server,
                and packet data is one in ct_ftp_info:
             ftp_data_fixup():
                ip_conntrack_change_expect(): change the expectation
                Modify packet contents with new address.
    
    NF_IP_POST_ROUTING:
       ip_nat_fn
          ct->nat.info->helper(): If packet going server->client,
                and packet data is one in ct_ftp_info:
             ftp_data_fixup():
                ip_conntrack_change_expect(): change the expectation
                Modify packet contents with new address.
    
    FTP DATA (EXPECTED) CONNECTION FIRST PACKET:
    NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING:
       ip_conntrack_in
          resolve_normal_ct
             init_conntrack: set ct->master.
       ip_nat_fn:
          master->nat.info.helper->expect()
             Set up source NAT mapping to match FTP control connection.
    
    NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING:
       ip_nat_fn:
          master->nat.info.helper->expect()
             Set up dest NAT mapping to match FTP control connection.
    
    
    The new flow looks like this:
    FTP CONTROL PACKET:
    NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING:
       ip_conntrack_in
          resolve_normal_ct
             init_conntrack: sets ct->helper to ip_conntrack_ftp.c:help()
    
    NF_IP_POST_ROUTING:
       ip_confirm:
          ct->helper->help:
             If !ip_nat_ftp_hook: ip_conntrack_expect().
             ip_nat_ftp:
                set exp->oldproto to old port.
                ip_conntrack_change_expect(): change the expectation
                set exp->expectfn to ftp_nat_expected.
                Modify packet contents with new address.
    
    FTP DATA (EXPECTED) CONNECTION FIRST PACKET:
    NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING:
       ip_conntrack_in
          resolve_normal_ct
             init_conntrack: set ct->master.
             call exp->expectfn (ftp_nat_expected):
                 call ip_nat_follow_master().
    
    The big changes are that the ip_nat_ftp module sets ip_conntrack_ftp's
    ip_nat_ftp_hook when it initializes, so it calls the NAT code directly
    when a packet containing the expect information is found by the
    conntrack helper: and this interface can carry all the information
    these two want to share.  Also, that conntrack helper is called as the
    packet leaves the box, so there are no issues with expectations being
    set up before the packet has been filtered.  The NAT helper doesn't
    need to register and duplicate the conntrack ports.
    
    The other trick is ip_nat_follow_master(), which does the NAT setup
    all at once (source and destination NAT as required) such that the
    expected connection is NATed the same way the master connection
    was.
    
    We also call ip_conntrack_tcp_update() (which I incidentally neatened)
    after mangling a TCP packet; ip_nat_seq_adjust() does this, but now
    mangling is done at the last possible moment, after
    ip_nat_seq_adjust() was already called.

    [ARM] Fix profile_pc() for SMP
    
    profile_pc() used thread_saved_fp() with the current task.  However,
    thread_saved_fp() only returns sane values when called for threads
    which are presently sleeping, so this caused an oops.  Instead, use
    regs->ARM_fp, which correspond with the frame pointer.

    [PATCH] Generic IRQ support for PA-RISC
    
    Make PA-RISC use the generic interrupt handling code.  We need one tiny
    change to the generic code -- the addition of a data pointer to irq_desc.
    This shouldn't be a problem in terms of increasing size of irq_desc for
    other architectures as the struct is cacheline aligned.  It's now 32
    bytes on 32-bit platforms and 44/48 bytes on 64-bit platforms (assuming
    spinlock_t is 4 bytes on 32-bit and 4 or 8 bytes on 64-bit).

    The input layer wants to send us an entropy event per input event and who are

    kill the remaining two keyboard and mouse sources.
    
    This eliminates lots of duplicate entropy events while covering all the input

    [PATCH] random: periodicity detection fix
    
    The input layer is now sending us a bunch of events in a row for each actual
    event.  This shows up weaknesses in the periodicity detector and using the
    high clock rate from get_clock: each keystroke is getting accounted as 10
    different maximal-entropy events.
    
    A brief touch on a trackpad will generate as much as 2000 maximal entropy
    events which is more than 2k of /dev/random output.  IOW, we're WAY
    overestimating input entropy.  Here's one keystroke:

    random 0060 0000 0000: added 11 entropy credits to input
    
    The first step to fixing this is to check periodicity and estimate entropy
    against a slow clock like jiffies.  We continue to mix in get_clock() rather
    than jiffies where available.
    
    This throws away most of the duplicate events and gives us more sensible
    entropy estimates, but we still duplicates from input.c and keyboard.c.

    [PATCH] serial: MPSC driver
    
    Patch for the Marvell MultiProtocol Serial Controller (MPSC).  This ctlr is
    on a series of host bridges (and other things) for PPC and MIPS processors.
    
    The ctlr operates similar to a typical network controller with send and
    receive rings.  Unfortunately there are many errata so you will see some
    "unusual" things in the code.  For example: a) An erratum prevents the
    reading of several registers on the ctlr (writing is okay).  To work around
    that, a local copy of what the registers are is kept and special macros are
    used to access those mirrored values.  b) Another erratum says that the
    MPSC cannot be used to access cache coherent memory (and many of the
    systems I use are cache coherent).  However, it seems to work okay as long
    as there are no snoop hits so there are macros in the code to manually
    manage the caches to prevent snoop hits.  Each macro checks a flag to see
    if the manual cache mgmt is necessary as not all versions have the erratum.
    
    The driver seems to work well but more testing is needed and it is lacking
    KGDB support.  I will get to both of those in time.

    [PATCH] pcmcia: ignore driver IRQ mask
    
    As its just one pin which can be used for IRQs on PCMCIA/CardBus cards, and
    only the _socket drivers_ care with which IRQ this pin is connected, only the
    socket drivers (assisted by the PCCARD core) should care about which IRQ to
    use.  Therefore, ignore the information passed to pcmcia_request_irq() in
    IRQInfo2.  In additional patches, all in-kernel users of IRQInfo2 will be
    removed; users wishing to influence the usage of IRQs can do so by modifying
    several driver's irq_mask parameter and/or by adding "exclude irq 3" to
    /etc/pcmcia/config.opts.  Note that a new sysfs-based interface to do so will
    be added in subsequent patches.

    [PATCH] clear false pending signal indication in core dump
    
    When kill is used to force a core dump, __group_complete_signal uses the
    group_stop_count machinery to stop other threads from doing anything more
    before the signal-taking thread starts the coredump synchronization.  This
    intentionally results in group_stop_count always still being > 0 when the
    signal-taking thread gets into do_coredump.  However, that has the
    unintended effect that signal_pending can return true when called from the
    filesystem code while writing the core dump file.  For NFS mounts using the
    "intr" option, this results in NFS operations bailing out before they even
    try, so core files never get successfully dumped on such a filesystem when
    the crash was induced by an asynchronous process-wide signal.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by clearing group_stop_count after the
    coredump synchronization is complete.
    
    The locking I threw in is not directly related, but always should have been
    there and may avoid some potential races with kill.

    [PATCH] fix exec deadlock when ptrace used inside the thread group
    
    If one thread uses ptrace on another thread in the same thread group, there
    can be a deadlock when calling exec.  The ptrace_stop change ensures that
    no tracing stop can be entered for a queued signal, or exit tracing, if the
    tracer is part of the same dying group.  The exit_notify change prevents a
    ptrace zombie from sticking around if its tracer is in the midst of a group
    exit (which an exec fakes), so these zombies don't hold up de_thread's
    synchronization.  The de_thread change ensures the new thread group leader
    doesn't wind up ptracing itself, which would produce its own deadlocks.

    [PATCH] fix race between core dumping and exec with shared mm
    
    When threads are sharing mm via CLONE_VM (linuxthreads, vfork), there is a
    race condition where one thread doing a core dump and synchronizing all

    did an exec and will never synchronize.  This patch makes the exec_mmap
    check for a pending core dump and punt the exec to synchronize with that,

    all.

    [PATCH] fix coredump_wait deadlock with ptracer & tracee on shared mm
    
    In the oddball situation where one thread is using ptrace on another thread
    sharing the same mm, and then someone sharing that mm causes a coredump,
    there is a deadlock possible if the traced thread is in TASK_TRACED state.
    It leaves all the threads sharing that mm wedged and permanently
    unkillable.  This patch checks for that situation and brings a thread out
    of TASK_TRACED if its tracer is part of the same coredump (i.e.  shares the
    same mm).  It's not pretty, but it does the job.

    With new unlocked_ioctl and ioctl_compat, ioctls can now be as fast as

    [PATCH] ext3/EA: Hide ext3_get_inode_loc in_mem option
    
    The in_mem optimization in ext3_get_inode_loc avoids a disk read when only
    the requested inode in the block group is allocated: In that case
    ext3_get_inode_loc assumes that it can recreate the inode from the
    in-memory inode.  This is incorrect with in-inode extended attributes,
    which don't have a shadow copy in memory.  Hide the in_mem option and
    clarify comments; the subsequent ea-in-inode changes the in_mem check as
    required.

    [PATCH] ext3/EA: Cleanup and prepare ext3 for in-inode xattrs
    
    Clean up several things in the xattr code, and prepare it for
    in-inode attributes:
    
    * Add the ext3_xattr_check_names, ext3_xattr_check_block, and
      ext3_xattr_check_entry functions for checking xattr data
      structures.
    * Add the ext3_xattr_find_entry, ext3_xattr_list_entries, and
      ext3_xattr_set_entry functions for manipulating xattr entries.
      Switch to using these functions in ext3_xattr_get,
      ext3_xattr_list, and ext3_xattr_set_handle.
    * Merge ext3_xattr_set_handle and ext3_xattr_set_handle2.
    * Rename the HDR and FIRST_ENTRY macros.
    * We have no way to deal with a ext3_xattr_cache_insert failure,
      so make it return void.
    * Make the debug messages more useful.

    [PATCH] ext3/EA: Ext3: do not use journal_release_buffer
    
    The use of journal_release_buffer is unsafe; it can overflow the journal:
    When a buffer is stolen from a transaction and later removed from that
    transaction with journal_release_buffer, the buffer is not accounted to the
    transaction that now "owns" the buffer, and one extra credit appears to be
    available.  Don't use journal_release_buffer:
    
    We did rely on the buffer lock to synchronize xattr block accesses, and get
    write access to the buffer first to get atomicity.  Return the
    mb_cache_entry from ext3_xattr_cache_find instead, and do the check/update
    under its lock.  Only get write access when we know we will use the buffer.

    [PATCH] ext3/EA: Race in ext[23] xattr sharing code
    
    Andrew Tridgell and Stephen C.  Tweedie have reported two different Oopses
    caused by a race condition in the mbcache, which is responsible for
    extended attribute sharing in ext2 and ext3.  Stephen tracked down the bug;
    I did the fix.
    
    Explanation:
    
    The mbcache caches the locations and content hashes of xattr blocks.  There
    are two access strategies: [1] xattr block disposal via
    mb_cache_entry_get(), [2] xattr block reuse (sharing) via
    mb_cache_entry_find_{first,next}().  There is no locking between the two
    methods, so between one mb_cache_entry_find_x and the next, a
    mb_cache_entry_get might come in, unhash the cache entry, and change the
    journaling state of the xattr buffer.  Subsequently, two things can happen:
    [a] the next mb_cache_entry_find_x may try to follow the mbcache hash chain
    starting from the entry that has become unhashed, which now is a stale
    pointer, [b] the block may have become deallocated, and then we try to
    reuse it.
    
    Fix this by converting the mbcache into a readers-writer style lock, and
    protect all block accesses in ext2/ext3 by the mbcache entry lock.  This
    ensures that destroying blocks is an exclusive operation that may not
    overlap xattr block reuse, while allowing multiple "re-users".  Write
    access to the xattr block's buffer is protected by the buffer lock.

    [PATCH] uml: fix and cleanup code in ubd_kern.c coming from ubd_user.c
    
    * Fix the use of errno: it refers to the __errno_location glibc definition
      when in ubd_user.c, and hence works; but in ubd_kern.c it refers to
      kernel_errno, which is different. So use the return value of os_* functions,
      as we should always have done.
    * Remove {read,write}_ubd_fs(), which are just silly.

    [PATCH] uml: move code from ubd_user to ubd_kern
    
    Most code of ubd_user.c already uses the os_* functions, so it can be moved to
    ubd_kern.c.  This patch simply moves the code without any hidden changes.
    
    The only change is inside io_thread(): since it calls signal(), I created a
    little function in ubd_user.c which just calls signal() with the right
    parameters.
    
    In a later patch (send together) I'll do some changes, to fix the usage of
    errno (which makes this code break when moved in a kernelspace file) and for
    some other little cleanups.

    [PATCH] uml: for ubd cmdline param use colon as delimiter
    
    Currently we can use this syntax ubd<n>[<flags>]=file1,file2. However, writing
    things as
    	ubd0=~/Uml/file1,~/Uml/file2
    does not work; in fact, the shell won't expand the second '~', since it's not
    at a path beginning; possibly even other shell expansions don't work here. So
    simply allow using, instead of the ',' separator, the ':' separator.
    
    The ',' separator can still be used to preserve backward compatibility.

    [PATCH] uml: fix some UML own initcall macros
    
    UML has his own initcall mechanism to handle his special userspace

    It must also duplicate some definition for the benefit of userspace code - but
    those definition weren't in sync with the main code.  Also, the UML own macros

    [PATCH] uml: Makefile simplification and correction.
    
    Cleanup: simplify a lot of strange constructs and whatever present in
    arch/um/Makefile.
    
    Also, get rid of redundant cleaning code introduced in
    "uml-fix-make-clean.patch" from 2.6.10-mm3 - when it was written it made
    sense, but I fixed most problems it addressed in a more elegant way.
    
    Also about that, don't remove $(ARCH_SYMLINKS) in make clean, but rather in
    make mrproper as we already do, like for include/asm-um and other symlinks.
    
    Finally, remove one wrong thing (almost a bug) introduced in that - the usage
    of the clean-dirs construct:
    
    clean-dirs := sys-$(SUBARCH)
    
    which is intended to delete one whole folder, rather than to descend to clean
    it, when used in normal Makefiles (not in the arch Makefile where is used,
    with no effect).  It's also not needed because that folder is cleaned because
    is listed in either $(core-y) or $(libs-y).

    [PATCH] uml: fail xterm_open when we have no $DISPLAY
    
    If UML wants to open an xterm channel and the xterm does not run properly (eg.
     terminates soon after starting) we will get a hang (a comment added in the
    patch explains why).
    
    This avoids the most common cause for this and adds a comment (which long term
    will go away with a rewrite of that code); the complete fix would be to catch
    the xterm process dying, up(&data->sem), and -EIO all requests from that point
    onwards.
    
    That applies for some of the other channels too, so part of the code should
    probably be abstracted a little and generalized.

    [PATCH] FRV: Remove mandatory single-step debugging diversion
    
    The attached patch removes the mandatory single-step diversion code from
    the FRV syscall handler that was put there for debugging purposes now that
    it's no longer needed.

    [PATCH] ppc64: lacks definition of MM_VM_SIZE()
    
    With David Woodhouse <dwmw2@infradead.org>
    
    We don't set MM_VM_SIZE() on ppc64, so it defaults to TASK_SIZE.  Which
    means a 32-bit process ending up in exit_mmap() to kill a 64-bit mm may
    call tlb_finish_mmu() with an incorrect 'end' argument.

    [PATCH] ppc64: iommu: avoid ISA io space on POWER3
    
    On some systems, the first PCI bus has a ISA I/O hole at the first 16MB.
    We can't use this space for DMA addresses on the bus.
    
    On Python-based machines, we'll skip the first 256MB on buses that have the
    hole, just as we do on later systems.  This means that the first bus will
    have 768MB of DMA space shared between the devices on it.

    [PATCH] ppc64: make iseries_veth call flush_scheduled_work()
    
    When the iseries_veth driver module is unloaded there is the potential for an
    oops and also some memory leakage.
    
    Because the HvLpEvent_unregisterHandler() function did no synchronisation,
    it was possible for the handler that was being unregistered to be running
    on another CPU *after* HvLpEvent_unregisterHandler() had returned.  This
    could cause the iseries_veth driver to leave work in the events work queue
    after the module had been unloaded.  When that work was eventually executed
    we got an oops.
    
    In addition some of the data structures in the iseries_veth driver were not
    being correctly freed when the module was unloaded.
    
    This is the second patch, we make iseries_veth call flush_scheduled_work()
    after we are sure the handler is no longer running, and also fix the memory
    leaks.

    I just discovered there's a thinko in the mark-page-accessed change in
    do_generic_mapping_read() in 2.6.11-rc1.  ra.prev_page is compared to index
    to see if we read from this page before - except that prev_page is actually
    set to the recent page or even a page in front of the current page.
    
    So we should store ra.prev_page in a seperate variable at the start of
    do_generic_mapping_read().

    [PATCH] InfiniBand/mthca: add needed rmb() in event queue poll
    
    Add an rmb() between checking the ownership bit of an event queue entry and
    reading the contents of the EQE.  Without this barrier, the CPU could read
    stale contents of the EQE before HW writes the EQE but have the read of the
    ownership bit reordered until after HW finishes writing, which leads to the
    driver processing an incorrect event.  This was actually observed to happen
    when multiple completion queues are in heavy use on an IBM JS20 PowerPC 970
    system.
    
    Also explain the existing rmb() in completion queue poll (there for the same
    reason) and slightly improve debugging output.

    Matthew Wilcox just converted parisc over to doing the generic irq code and
    we ran across the symbol probe_irq_mask being undefined (and thus
    preventing yenta_socket from loading).
    
    It looks like the EXPORT_SYMBOL() was accidentally missed from
    kernel/irq/autoprobe.c and no-one noticed on x86 because it's still in
    i386_ksyms.c
    
    This patch corrects the problem so that the generic irq code now works
    completely on parisc.

       to get correct uptime numbers
    3) if there is an i/o request outstanding the steal time should be
       added to iowait, even if the hypervisor scheduled another virtual
       cpu since we are still waiting for i/o.
    2) steal time while idle without an i/o request outstanding has to
       be added to cpustat->idle and not to cpustat->system.

    Make pipe buffer handling more generic.
    
    Use a "pipe_buf_operations" structure to describe the ops that
    can be done on a pipe buffer, so that pipe buffers from different
    sources can have their own rules.
    
    Right now the rules are just about how you map the buffers into
    kernel virtual memory space, and how to release them (and whether
    you can append new data to the end of an existing buffer).

    [PATCH] Don't busy-lock-loop in preemptable spinlocks
    
    Paul Mackerras points out that doing the _raw_spin_trylock each time
    through the loop will generate tons of unnecessary bus traffic.
    Instead, after we fail to get the lock we should poll it with simple
    loads until we see that it is clear and then retry the atomic op.
    Assuming a reasonable cache design, the loads won't generate any bus
    traffic until another cpu writes to the cacheline containing the lock.
    
    Agreed.

    [MMC] Add comment about GENHD_FL_REMOVABLE to mmc_block
    
    We don't set GENHD_FL_REMOVABLE because this flag indicates that
    the media may be removed while the block device persists.  Since
    MMC destroys the block device when the card (media + on-board
    controller) is removed, the block device will never exist without
    media present.  Therefore, setting GENHD_FL_REMOVABLE would be
    misleading.

    [ARM PATCH] 2403/1: S3C2410 - clock initialsation tidy
    
    Patch from Ben Dooks
    
    Update to the s3c2410/s3c2440 clock code to use
    the naming conventions now used throughout the
    arch/arm/mach-s3c2410/ directory, as well as
    a re-organisation of the initialisation of the
    clocks.
    The previous method was to initialise the clocks
    as part of the function that initialised the
    statically mapped IO regions, which was called
    from the machine initialisation. This proves
    a problem if the machine initialisation needs
    to use these IO areas to determine the frequency
    of PLL crystal fitted.
    This patch makes the following changes:
     - s3c2410_init_clocks renamed s3c24xx_setup_clocks
     - s3c2410_clkcon_enable renamed s3c24xx_clk_enable
     - s3c2410_register_clock renamed s3c24xx_register_clock
     - cpu specific init_clocks to be called from cpu.c
     - add s3c24xx_init_clocks for machine init to call
     - split the cpu specific clock code from xxx_map_io
     - update all machine initialisation methods
    and the following changes as cleanup which should
    have been caught by previous patches:
     - remove s3c2440_hdiv (unused)
     - remove s3c2440_clock_tick_rate (unused)
    This patch has been generated from a request by
    Dimitry Andric.

    [CPUFREQ] ondemand: don't increase to full speed at startup (Bruno Ducrot)
    
    From: Bruno Ducrot <ducrot@poupinou.org>
    
    dbs_timer_init() will schedule_work(&dbs_work) so that do_dbs_timer()
    is likely called very early at same time slice scheduler, and
    for each cpu, dbs_check_cpu(cpu) will be called, likely at the same time
    slice than dbs_timer_init().
    So far, we will get total_idle_ticks == idle_ticks == 0 unconditonaly,
    and the processor will be put at full speed even though it's not needed
    at startup.

    [PATCH] USB: add driver for the Siemens ID Mouse fingerprint sensor
    
    This patch adds a new usb-misc driver for the fingerprint sensor that
    can be found in the Siemens ID Mouse USB. "cat /dev/usb/idmouseX"
    yields a 225x288 greyscale PNM with the fingerprint information.
    
    It's now in version 0.5, which uses memcpy() instead of snprintf()
    and allows interruption of the image acquisition process, in case
    it should get stuck.
    
    It may be considered controversial that it outputs a PNM instead
    of raw data, but I hold the opinion that the 15 bytes of header,
    "P5 225 288 256 ", do not do any harm and allow the device to be
    used in shell scripts or similar, too.
    
    The setup packets are not described further, simply because I don"t
    know anything about them myself. We captured them under Windows
    using SnoopyPro.
    
    Please include this into the main USB kernel tree - I think it has
    by now been scrutinized and tested quite thoroughly.

    [PATCH] pegasus 2.6.10 cset
    
    Various fixes to the 'pegasus' driver, notably fixing OSDL bugid #3978
    so this can be used with bridges again (or for that matter, other
    normal usage).
    
        * Bugfixes in the status urb completion handler:
    
            - Never use garbage that happens to be sitting in the URB
              data buffer to change the carrier status.
    
    
            - There are two bits which claim to report parts of carrier
              detect bit.  This switches to the one that works sometimes;
              monitoring through MII might be the best solution.
    
            - Stop log spamming ... at least some of these chips seem
              to get confused about data toggle, no point in warning
              about each packet error as it's detected.
    
        * Report the normal Ethernet MTU.
    
        * Better ethtool support:
    
            - Save the message level set by userspace
            - Basic WOL support
    
        * Add USB suspend() and resume() methods, to go with WOL.
          Modeled on what stir4200 does.
    
    Also, some of the messages are converted to the more conventional
    style:  "ethN: message text", or driver model style before the
    device is registered.
    
    	* removed redundant MII code since CONFIG_MII is always set by Kconfig;
      	* updated the version string;

    This is a revised patch to fix a problem in the UHCI driver, in which the

    [PATCH] USB: Patch to fix ub looping with a tag mismatch
    
    If a command times out, we resubmit a retry. Some devices, however, buffer
    everything we send and then eventually reply to a command we have timed out
    already. We receive a bad tag, send a new command, device replies to the
    one sent before, and so on without end.
    
    The fix is to flush pending replies if tags mismatch (by reading them).

      capabilities without checking if they were supported. Document
      which capabilities are required and which are optional.
    * Reorder things a bit. In particular, wait to have a valid client
      before we bother checking if this is a Vaio EEPROM.
    * Use strlcpy instead of strncpy, because I Heard It Was Better (TM) and
      all other chip drivers use it.
    * Take benefit of the auto-increment feature of EEPROMs to speed up the
      Vaio check.
    * Display an information message when a Vaio EEPROM is detected.
    
    Tested successfully on my laptop, which happens to be a Vaio.

    [PATCH] I2C: adm1026.c fixes
    
    Ok, take 3 on the adm1026 patch.
    
    In this patch:
    
    (1) Code has been added which ensures that the fan divisor registers are
        properly read into the data structure before fan minimum speeds are
        determined.  This prevents a possible divide by zero error.  The line
        which reads the hardware default fan divisor values has been reformatted
        as suggested by Andreas Dilger to make the intent of the statement clearer.
    
    (2) In a similar spirit, an unecessary carriage return from a "dev_dbg"
        statement in the adm1026_print_gpio() function has been elminated,
        shortening the statement to a single line and making the code easier
        to read.

    Ok, thanks for doing the thinking ;), here is the modified patch
    (it87.c_2.6.10-jm3-corrected_manual_pwm_20050111.diff). In addition to
    the above change, it also refreshes fan_main_ctrl in the update routine,
    as suggested by Jean on IRC.
    
     - adds manual PWM
     - removes buggy "reset" module parameter

        can't get to bdev->bd_openers without sleeping.)
    
      * Scott Feldman suggestions:
        don't do needless assignment of skb->dev in aoenet_rcv.
        use skb_push instead of just adding to skb->len.
        also trivial: make data in struct frame unsigned char array.
    
      * Alan Cox suggestion: use net_ratelimit to avoid flooding syslog
    
      * documentation updates and corrections
    
      * support one-partition per device for compatibility with systems
        having poor support for large minor device numbers

    [PATCH] bio clone memory corruption
    
    Doing some raid testing threw a bug in the scsi mid layer, because the
    segment counts wasn't correct.  Initially I worried that we still had
    problems in this area, but it turns out that is due to the raid usage of
    bio clones.  Currently you have to hold on to the original bio as well,
    since the clone only maintains a pointer to the bio_vec inside the
    original bio.  If the original bio is freed first, the clone will have
    garbage in its bio->bi_io_vec as soon as that memory is scribbled.
    
    I think the best fix is to maintain flexibility and duplicate the io_vec
    inside the clone as well. Attached patch does this.

    Patch from Lothar Wassmann
    
    Hi,
    ioremapping a memory range that ends on the first byte of a page
    (e.g. mapping PAGE_SIZE + 1 bytes on a page boundary) results in a
    mapping that is one page too short. In particular trying to create a 1
    byte mapping at the start of a page results in a BUG_ON() assertion in
    remap_area_pages() because the calculated mapping size is zero.

    [TCP]: Fix sk_forward_alloc assertion failures with TSO.
    
    do_tcp_sendpages() needs to do skb->truesize et al.
    accounting just like tcp_sendmsg() does.
    
    tcp_sendmsg() works by gradually adjusting these
    accounting knobs as user data is copied into the
    packet.
    
    do_tcp_sendpages() works differently, when it allocates
    a new SKB it optimistically adds in tp->mss_cache to
    these values and then makes no adjustments at all as
    pages are tacked onto the packet.
    
    This does not work at all if tcp_sendmsg() queues a
    packet onto the send queue, and then do_tcp_sendpages()
    attaches pages onto the end of that SKB.  We are left
    with a very inaccurate skb->truesize in that case.
    
    Consequently, if we were building a TSO frame and it
    gets partially ACK'd, then since skb->truesize is too
    small tcp_trim_skb() will potentially underflow it's
    value and all the accounting becomes corrupted.
    
    This is usually seen as sk->sk_forward_alloc being
    negative at socket destroy time, which triggers an
    assertion check.

    [PATCH] PPC64 Move thread_info flags to its own cache line
    
    This patch fixes a problem I have been seeing since all the preempt
    changes went in, which is that ppc64 SMP systems would livelock
    randomly if preempt was enabled.
    
    It turns out that what was happening was that one cpu was spinning in
    spin_lock_irq (the version at line 215 of kernel/spinlock.c) madly
    doing preempt_enable() and preempt_disable() calls.  The other cpu had
    the lock and was trying to set the TIF_NEED_RESCHED flag for the task
    running on the first cpu.  That is an atomic operation which has to be
    retried if another cpu writes to the same cacheline between the load
    and the store, which the other cpu was doing every time it did
    preempt_enable() or preempt_disable().
    
    I decided to move the thread_info flags field into the next cache
    line, since it is the only field that would regularly be modified by
    cpus other than the one running the task that owns the thread_info.
    (OK possibly the `cpu' field would be on a rebalance; I don't know the
    rebalancing code, but that should be pretty infrequent.)  Thus, moving
    the flags field seems like a good idea generally as well as solving the
    immediate problem.
    
    For the record I am pretty unhappy with the code we use for spin_lock
    et al. with preemption turned on (the BUILD_LOCK_OPS stuff in
    spinlock.c).  For a start we do the atomic op (_raw_spin_trylock) each
    time around the loop.  That is going to be generating a lot of
    unnecessary bus (or fabric) traffic.  Instead, after we fail to get
    the lock we should poll it with simple loads until we see that it is
    clear and then retry the atomic op.  Assuming a reasonable cache
    design, the loads won't generate any bus traffic until another cpu
    writes to the cacheline containing the lock.
    
    Secondly we have lost the __spin_yield call that we had on ppc64,
    which is an important optimization when we are running under the
    hypervisor.  I can't just put that in cpu_relax because I need to know
    which (virtual) cpu is holding the lock, so that I can tell the
    hypervisor which virtual cpu to give my time slice to.  That
    information is stored in the lock variable, which is why __spin_yield
    needs the address of the lock.

    [PATCH] PPC64 Call preempt_schedule on exception exit
    
    This patch mirrors the recent changes on x86 to call preempt_schedule
    rather than schedule in the exception exit path, in the case where the
    preempt_count is zero and the TIF_NEED_RESCHED bit is set.
    
    I'm a little concerned that this means that we have a window where
    interrupts are enabled and we are on our way into preempt_schedule,
    but preempt_count is still zero.  Ingo's proposed preempt_schedule_irq
    would fix this, and I think something like that should go in.

    [PATCH] possible rq starvation on oom
    
    I stumbled across this the other day. The block layer only uses a single
    memory pool for request allocation, so it's very possible for eg writes
    to have allocated them all at any point in time. If that is the case and
    the machine is low on memory, a reader attempting to allocate a request
    and failing in blk_alloc_request() can get stuck for a long time since
    no one is there to wake it up.
    
    The solution is either to add the extra mempool so both reads and writes
    have one, or attempt to handle the situation. I chose the latter, to
    save the extra memory required for the additional mempool with
    BLKDEV_MIN_RQ statically allocated requests per-queue.
    
    If a read allocation fails and we have no readers in flight for this
    queue, mark us rq-starved so that the next write being freed will wake
    up the sleeping reader(s). Same situation would happen for writes as
    well of course, it's just a lot more unlikely.

    A recent trivial fixup in sys_getdents64 gives gcc-2.96 indigestion in

    Patch from Richard Purdie
    
    The Sharp SL-C7xx Series (Corgi) has 3 devices connected to the SSP
    interface each needing different configurations of the port.
    This code provides the necessary access and locking so drivers can
    access these components. It uses the functions provided by the PXA
    SSP driver to access the port.
    It also adds some machine specific GPIO definitions used by this
    code and adds some comments to existing definitions.

    SCSI: add starget_for_each_device
    
    From: 	James.Smart@Emulex.Com
    
    This patch deprecates the use of device_for_each_child() with stargets.
    The reasoning behind this is due to issues regarding:
          Semaphores that device_for_each_child() takes
          Implicit assumptions that each child is an sdev device.
    
    The patch adds a new helper function, starget_for_each_device(), and
    replaces all previous uses of device_for_each_child().

    Patch from Ben Dooks
    
    This cleans up a few items in arch/arm/mach-s3c2410
    with naming of functions and a build problem. Items
    which are general to s3c2410 and s3c2440 are now
    named s3c24xx_ instead of s3c2410_, as well as
    moving them to the correct headers.
    The patch also fixes a problem where at least one
    s3c2410 target had to be selected to allow an s3c2440
    target to build without error.
    The following have been renamed:
    	s3c2410_init_irq -> s3c24xx_init_irq
    	s3c2410_timer -> s3c24xx_timer

    Handle two threads both trying to expand their stack simultaneously.
    
    We had all the locking right, but we didn't check whether one of the
    threads now no longer needed to expand, so we could incorrectly _shrink_
    the stack in the other thread instead (not only causing segfaults, but
    since we didn't do a proper unmap, we'd possibly leak pages too).
    
    So re-check the need for expand after getting the lock.
    
    Noticed by Paul Starzetz.

    [PATCH] BUG on error handlings in Ext3 under I/O failure condition
    
    I found bugs on error handlings in the functions arround the ext3 file
    system, which cause inadequate completions of synchronous write I/O
    operations when disk I/O failures occur.  Both 2.4 and 2.6 have this
    problem.
    
    	I carried out following experiment:
    
    1.  Mount a ext3 file system on a SCSI disk with ordered mode.
    2.  Open a file on the file system with O_SYNC|O_RDWR|O_TRUNC|O_CREAT flag.
    3.  Write 512 bytes data to the file by calling write() every 5 seconds, and
         examine return values from the syscall.
         from write().
    4.  Disconnect the SCSI cable,  and examine messages from the kernel.
    
    After the SCSI cable is disconnected, write() must fail.  But the result
    was different: write() succeeded for a while even though messages of the
    kernel notified SCSI I/O error.
    
    By applying following modifications, the above problem was solved.

    One bios assigns a small window for i/o access to yenta bridges.  But there
    are Cardbus cards that needs lots of i/o ports.  yenta usually honors the bios
    selected values, except if the bios choice is clearly invalid.  The patch
    allows an override from the command line.

    [PATCH] pcmcia: validate_mem only for non-statically mapped sockets
    
    validate_mem() does only make sense for !SS_CAP_STATIC_MAP sockets. Therefore,
    re-direct validate_mem() calls only for those. The newly added redirection
    layer will allow for a "library" module named "rsrc_nonstatic" which contains
    the resource database handling code, and it will only need to be loaded for
    the drivers which need it.

    [PATCH] pcmcia: Add disable_clkrun option
    
    I received report that transmission of Realtek 8139 doesn't work.  The
    cause of this problem was CLKRUN protocols of laptop's TI 12xx CardBus
    bridge.
    
    CLKRUN is used for controlling the PCI clock by PCI devices (for power saving).
     If device has bug, probably it becomes the cause of stopping the PCI clock at
    an unexpected timing.
    
    In the problem of realtek 8139 case, the TX packet which the driver set to the
    device was not sent out (still pending state in device).
    
    If "disable_clkrun" is enabled, the problem of TX stopped occurring.  So, I
    thought the cause is CLKRUN, and is hardware bug of Cardbus or realtek 8139.
    (8139 seems only can control by rewriting EEPROM)
    
    And looks like also
     http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q294465
     http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;182591
    has the problem of CLKRUN.
    
    And I remember that this problem had happened on Thinkpad before.  In the
    case, problem seems solved by similar workaround of sound/oss/cs46xx.c.
    
    This patch adds "disable_clkrun" option as workaround of problem to
    yenta_socket.

    [PATCH] pcmcia: direct-ordered unbind of devices
    
    Restructure unbind_request():
    Before, unbind_request was called by cardmgr on the following occasions:
    
    a) if the CS_EVENT_CARD_INSERTION event failed
    
    b) during do_remove(), which is called on
    	1) when cardmgr is informed of a CS_EVENT_CARD_REMOVAL event
    	2) when cardmgr is informed of a CS_EVENT_EJECTION_REQUEST event, if
    	   do_check() succeeds
    	3) cardmgr exit (SIGINT/SIGTERM), if do_check() succeeds
    
    We can ignore a), as the user is informed of the problem anyway, and can
    take appropriate action then (eject the card, update config, write new driver,
    insert card...).
    
    b1) can be done directly, even before the userspace cardmgr is informed.
        This speeds up the call to ->detach().
    
    b2) All drivers I checked were based on the assumption that a
        CS_EVENT_CARD_REMOVAL event is received _first_, before a call to
        ->detach().  Most notably, some drivers issue first a call to their
        release() function [which else is called during EVENT_CARD_REMOVAL] during
        ->detach() if it hasn't been issued before.  So, it doesn't hurt if unbind
        is only called during the EVENT_CARD_REMOVAL step, and not during
        EJECTION_REQUEST.  The REMOVAL step is only called anyway if
        EJECTION_REQUEST succeeds, and the latter can only succeed if do_check()
        succeeds.
    
    b3) If cardmgr exits from daemon mode, ds_release() is called.  I can't
        see a reason why this is good behaviour, especially as cards don't need
        cardmgr while running, only for setup.
    
    Consequences:
    - call unbind_request during CARD_REMOVAL handling, even before userspace
      is informed.
    - return "0" if UNBIND_REQUEST is called from userspace.
    - the driver's event handler is called with CARD_REMOVAL _always_ before
      ->detach() is called.

    As discussed previously, my integration of ds.c and cs.c with the driver model
    can and will only be available under the GPL, as it's too much derived of
    other buses' implementation of integration with the driver model.
    
    cs_internal.h did only contain the MPL header before - I contacted Dave Hinds
    because of this, and as far as he can tell, it was just an oversight that this
    was not marked as dual-licensed as the other files are.

    Add a new registration function to register the PCMCIA 16-bit subsystem
    (ds a.k.a. pcmcia) with the PCMICA core (cs a.k.a. pcmcia_core).
    
    As send_event is only called with skt->sem held, we can use that to safeguard
    skt->callback(), too. Note that the class_device_register() call by pccardd()
    is done _before_ skt->sem() is held, and the pcmcia_socket_register() doesn't
    hold skt->sem() as well, so there is no chance for a deadlock.

    [PATCH] fix ->setattr ATTR_SIZE locking for nfsd
    
    Since the big direct I/O rework do_truncate takes i_alloc_sem before
    calling into ->setattr.  Unfortunately the other callers of ->setattr with
    ATTR_SIZE, most notably nfsd don't take it.
    
    The (out of tree) XFS dmapi code relies wants to release i_alloc_sem and
    thus gets into problems like
    
    	http://oss.sgi.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=365
    
    This patch moves acquiring and releasing i_alloc_sem into notify_change()
    to make the locking behaviour consistant.

    [PATCH] easily tweakable comm length
    
    This change still keeps the comm length at 16, but allows easier patching
    for local modifications, and also introduces a macro to use instead of
    magic 16, where sizeof(comm) is not preferable to use.
    
    Not able to use killall, pidof etc.  effectively, when long process names
    are used for scripts.  Just changing the command length from 16 to 32
    breaks a.out coredump logic.  Deamonise and get_task_comm helped in other

    [PATCH] UML: Use va_copy
    
    In arch/um/kernel/skas/uaccess.c, the simple assignment
       va_list args = *((va_list *) arg_ptr);
    is used in do_buffer_op() to obtain a copy of a va_list, that
    was delivered as a pointer only.
    But this construction doesn't compile on s390. Instead,
    va_copy() and va_end() should be used (see "man va_start").

    [PATCH] x86_64: Fix signal FPU leak on i386 and x86-64
    
    Found by Bodo Stroesser. Description from Bodo:
    
    >>
    On i386, if a signal handler is started, the kernel saves the fpu-state
    of the interrupted routine in the sigcontext on the stack. Calling
    unlazy_fpu() and setting current->used_math=0, the kernel supplies the
    signal-handler with a cleared virtual fpu.
    On sigreturn(), the old fpu-state of the interrupted routine is
    restored.
    
    If a process never used the fpu, it virtually has a cleared fpu.
    If such a process is interrupted by a signal handler, no fpu-context is
    saved and sigcontext->fpstate is set to NULL.
    
    Assume, that the signal handler uses the fpu. Then, AFAICS, on sigreturn
    current->used_math will be 1. Since sigcontext->fpstate still is NULL,
    restore_sigcontext() doesn't call restore_i387(). Thus, no
    clear_fpu() is done, current->used_math is not reset.
    
    Now, the interrupted processes fpu no longer is cleared!
    <<
    
    Fix by AK. Just clear the FPU again when this happens.

    [PATCH] i386: AMD dual core support for i386
    
    AMD dual core support for i386
    
    Run HT initialization on AMD dual core CPUs on i386.  They fake being HT CPUs.
     This patch makes the HT detection run on AMD CPUs too.  I moved the HT
    detection code into a common file from intel.c for that.
    
    It would be actually better to run HT detection always on all CPUs but this
    would need a second callback afterwards to AMD code, which I avoided for now.
    
    It adds a cpuinfo->x86_num_cores field.
    
    This sets up the phys_proc_id[] array.  This overloads this array with HT, but
    when smp_num_siblings is 1
    
    It is currently only used for /proc/cpuinfo printing.  The reason we want to
    behave this like SMT is that there are some license managers in user space
    that license according to number of physical CPUs, and when they handle HT
    they should handle CMP with this hack too.  Another reason we need this is
    that the powernow k8 driver needs this information to properly manage dual
    core CPUs.
    
    When there are ever dual core HT CPUs this will need small changes in
    smpboot.c.  I didn't do this for now to keep the patch simple.
    
    Then we set smp_num_siblings to 1 on these systems again to prevent the
    scheduler from setting up HT scheduling (which is not a very good match for
    dual core).
    
    This is a port of the CMP support code from x86-64 (minus the NUMA bits)

    [PATCH] APIC/LAPIC hanging problems on nForce2 system
    
    current state:
    Systems with Nforce2 could freeze on high disk i/o activity in APIC mode
    when CPU Disconnect is enabled. If bios doesn't fix this, current kernel
    fix changes the registers according to follwing table:
    
          * Chip  Old value   New value
          * C17   0x1F0FFF01  0x1F01FF01
          * C18D  0x9F0FFF01  0x9F01FF01
    
    But this is only done, if cpu disconnect has been enabled in bios.
    
    why change this:
    If CPU disconnect is not enabled in bios, and bios is broken (some
    manufacturers like Abit don't care about their customers and even the
    latest bios doesn't fix this; I have an Abit mainboard), the kernel
    doesn't apply the fix, so if cpu disconnect is enabled at a later stage
    (in userspace), the system will be unstable and most likely freeze.
    
    new behaviour:
    The fix is now applied regardless of cpu disconnect being enabled at
    boot time, or not. As you only have to change byte 3 to 0x01, reading
    out chipset version isn't needed, so the patch simplifies the fix. Now
    turning cpu disconnect on, at later stage won't break the system, and if
    it was already enabled, it gets fixed, as the old version did.

    Rationale:
    
    changing HZ to higher values (like 5k,10k or 20k) will hang machines using
    wait_8254_wraparound() indefinitely, because a suboptimal workaround for
    buggy Intel Mercury/Neptune chipsets is in place.
    
    this was tested on several machines, unfortunately none with a broken Intel
    Mercury/Neptune chipset, and it works fine with various HZ values ...

    [PATCH] ppc64: xtime <-> gettimeofday can get out of sync
    
    I've noticed a problem where xtime and gettimeofday could get out of sync if
    interrupts are disabled for too long (eg long kernel code paths or dropping
    into the debugger for a while).
    
    We correctly replay lost jiffies but in that loop time_sync_xtime syncs the
    intermediate values of xtime up with the current value of gettimeofday.  So
    xtime jumps by a bunch and from then on it is ahead of gettimeofday and we
    never resync the two.  I guess this is to avoid xtime going backwards.
    
    The patch below creates a __do_gettimeofday where you can pass in a tb value
    and sync the intermediate values of xtime properly.
    
    Note that the time_sync_xtime check only stops the seconds from going
    backwards, the ns component still could couldnt it?  Considering this is hard
    to get right, should we switch to the time interpolator stuff?  The only
    problem there is it might be trouble for systemcfg (which exports stuff to do
    userspace gettimeofday).

    instruction, comparing against one is not good enough.
    
    For the momemt remove the code in question so BUG()s work again and we can
    discuss a better solution (I thought kprobes was emulating instructions or
    running them out of line).

    [PATCH] ppc64: Move hotplug cpu functions to smp_ops
    
    This should allow for easier adding of hotplug cpu support for other PPC64
    subarchs.  The patch is untested but does compile with and without hotplug
    cpu on pSeries and G5 configs.  What can get slightly confusing is the fact
    that both ppc_md and smp_ops have cpu_die members.

    The 4level mods have caused 2level swapoff to miss entries and hang.
    There's probably a one-line fix for that, but the error is really caused
    by previous awkwardness - each mask applied on two levels, an "address"
    that's an offset plus an "offset" that's an address.  Simplify the four
    levels to behave in the same address/next/end way and the bug vanishes.

    [PATCH] cputime: introduce cputime
    
    This patch introduces the concept of (virtual) cputime.  Each architecture
    can define its method to measure cputime.  The main idea is to define a
    cputime_t type and a set of operations on it (see asm-generic/cputime.h).
    Then use the type for utime, stime, cutime, cstime, it_virt_value,
    it_virt_incr, it_prof_value and it_prof_incr and use the cputime operations
    for each access to these variables.  The default implementation is jiffies
    based and the effect of this patch for architectures which use the default
    implementation should be neglectible.
    
    There is a second type cputime64_t which is necessary for the kernel_stat
    cpu statistics.  The default cputime_t is 32 bit and based on HZ, this will
    overflow after 49.7 days.  This is not enough for kernel_stat (ihmo not
    enough for a processes too), so it is necessary to have a 64 bit type.
    
    The third thing that gets introduced by this patch is an additional field
    for the /proc/stat interface: cpu steal time.  An architecture can account
    cpu steal time by calls to the account_stealtime function.  The cpu which
    backs a virtual processor doesn't spent all of its time for the virtual
    cpu.  To get meaningful cpu usage numbers this involuntary wait time needs
    to be accounted and exported to user space.
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    The p->signal check in account_system_time is insufficient.  If the timer
    interrupt hits near the end of exit_notify, after EXIT_ZOMBIE has been set,
    another cpu may release_task (NULLifying p->signal) in between
    account_system_time's check and check_rlimit's dereference.  Nor should
    account_it_prof risk send_sig.  But surely account_user_time is safe?

    [PATCH] fix unresolved MTD symbols in scx200_docflash.c
    
    This driver is using some private #ifdef to try to control the use of
    partitions and calling functions that get compiled out of the kernel if it's
    set (which it is by default).  This results in unresolved module symbols,
    which are bad.
    
    This patch synchronizes the conditional compilation of partition management in
    the driver with the global config option for MTD partition management and
    thereby fixes the unresolved symbol problem.

    [PATCH] signedness fix in deadline-iosched.c
    
    There is some (obvious) mess with "unsigned int" and "int" in the
    deadline-io-scheduler (sysfs-section).  Try to change the attribute
    "writes_starved":
    
    	root@ezs-mobil:/sys/block/hda/queue# cat scheduler
    	noop anticipatory [deadline]
    	root@ezs-mobil:/sys/block/hda/queue# cd iosched/
    	root@ezs-mobil:/sys/block/hda/queue/iosched# ls
    	fifo_batch  front_merges  read_expire  write_expire  writes_starved
    	root@ezs-mobil:/sys/block/hda/queue/iosched# cat writes_starved
    	2
    	root@ezs-mobil:/sys/block/hda/queue/iosched# echo 4 >writes_starved
    	root@ezs-mobil:/sys/block/hda/queue/iosched# cat writes_starved
    	-2147483648
    	root@ezs-mobil:/sys/block/hda/queue/iosched#
    
    Because all attribute-variables are defined as "int", the patch
    below changes them to "int". Now it works as expected...

    [PATCH] random: remove pool resizing sysctl
    
    Remove random pool resizing sysctl.  It's racy in hard to fix ways and
    doesn't really warrant fixing.  It also only allows adjusting the input
    pool size so it's either obsolete or incomplete.
    
    The default 4kbits (512 bytes) of entropy pool should be more than big
    enough for all purposes and too small to be a memory concern.
    
    This patch removes the resizing code and marks the sysctl read-only.

    XFS doesn't need the i_alloc_sem at all, so we should avoid taking it in

    [PATCH] m32r: employ new kernel API/ABI
    
    We, Linux/M32R project members, decided to change the kernel API/ABI.  This
    modification is not small, but if we don't change it now, perhaps we have
    no chance to change them hereafter.
    
    * Why change the m32r kernel API/ABI?
    - The m32r port has many old-style syscall interfaces,
      because we made m32r port refering to the other traditional archs.
      Some old syscalls are no longer used or can be safely removed
      by upgrading the GNU C library.
    - To make the m32r kernel more secure, it is preferable to prevent
      stack region from being executed. (e.g. stack overflow)
    
    * API/ABI changes
    - include/asm-m32r/unistd.h: Upgrade to the new kernel API.
    - arch/m32r/entry.S: Minimum update to the new ABI.
    - Don't use UID16 syscalls.
    - To make stack noexecutable:
      1) Don't use trampoline for signal handlers for kernel space (cf. sparc64):
        sys_signal: remove.
        sys_sigaction, sys_rt_sigaction: use glibc's restorer.
      2) Don't generate trampoline code by GCC in userspace:
        Support non-executable stack by the m32r gcc.
        --> done (for gcc-3.4.3/gcc-4.0)
    
    * New userland
    - This modification does *not* keep backward compatibility.
      So we have been prepared new userland, based on the new API/ABI.
      Already, more than 200 new Debian deb binary packages are available
      on the Linux/M32R site:
      http://debian.linux-m32r.org/dists/04_ordovician/ (for this new ABI)

    [PATCH] swsusp: properly suspend and resume all devices
    
    During resume, my previous patch switches over to the saved swsusp image
    without suspending all devices first.  This patch fixes that oversight, so
    that the state of the hardware upon resume more closely matches the state
    it had at suspend time.
    
    While my previous patch alone seemed to work fine in my testing, it is
    not fully correct without this as well.

    [PATCH] swsusp: device power management fix
    
    Since at least kernel 2.6.9, if not earlier, swsusp fails to properly
    suspend and resume all devices.
    
    The most notable effect is that resuming fails to properly reconfigure
    interrupt routers.  In 2.6.9 this was obscured by other kernel code, but in
    2.6.10 this often causes post-resume APIC errors and near-total failure of
    some PCI devices (e.g.  network, sound and USB controllers).
    
    Even in cases where interrupt routing is unaffected, this bug causes other
    problems.  For instance, on one of my systems I have to run "ifdown
    eth0;ifup eth0" after resume in order to have functional networking, if I
    do not apply this patch.
    
    By itself, this patch is not theoretically complete; my next patch fixes
    that.  However, this patch is the critical one for fixing swsusp's behavior
    in the real world.

    [PATCH] ppc64: fix iommu cleanup regression
    
    In the recent IOMMU cleanup, the new LPAR code assumes that all PHBs must
    have a dma window assigned to it.  On some machines we don't have a window
    assinged unless there's an adapter in the slot.
    
    In other words, a PHB without a ibm,dma-window property is not a bug and
    must be tolerated.  This patch fixes that, and also removes a redundant
    check for the dma-window being defined.

    When a thread stops for ptrace exit tracing, it cannot be resumed by

    [PATCH] let SIGKILL wake TASK_TRACED
    
    Upon reevaluation we think it is indeed safe to permit the race between
    a ptrace call and the traced thread waking up, as long as it will never
    get back to user mode.  This patch makes SIGKILL wake up threads in
    TASK_TRACED.  That alone resolves most of the deadlock issues that
    became possible with the introduction of TASK_TRACED, getting us back to
    the killing behavior of 2.6.8 and before.
    
    This patch also further cleans up ptrace detaching, so that threads are
    left in TASK_STOPPED only if a job control stop is actually in effect,
    and otherwise resume.  This removes the past nuisances requiring a
    SIGCONT to resume a thread even when it had a pending SIGKILL.

    [ARM PATCH] 2366/1: PXA: Add machine type detection for the Sharp SL-C7xx series
    
    Patch from Richard Purdie
    
    The Sharp SL-C7xx series of PDAs (Corgi, Shepherd, Husky) don't set
    the machine type upon startup. Fixing this isn't possible as the
    devices have been produced and the bootloaders are in ROM.
    
    This header code detects the differences between them and sets the
    machine type accordingly. By doing this one kernel can support the
    series of PXA25x machines.
    
    The code also detects Poodle (Sharp SL-5600) which is also a PXA25x
    device allowing a common kernel to support that device as well. (The
    base machine code is under development for this device).

    [ARM PATCH] 2373/1: S3C2410 -  fix possible loop in irq macro
    
    Patch from Ben Dooks
    
    If we read the INTPEND register and get the wrong
    result (details below) then it looks like a possible
    loop to go back and re-read it after calculating
    the possible correct value for it.
    
    It seems that the INTPEND register, which should
    show the unique number of the interrupt that we
    need to handle. However, it seems that this register
    can show the wrong interrupt under certain conditions.
    
    Shannon's research shows that it is very possible that
    the occurence of an external interrupt can end up
    merging with the base interrupt number, causing
    the wrong result in the register.
    
    This patch also fixes the end position of the #ifdef
    block and ensures as many registers as possible are
    stacked before calling printk() for debug.

    However, an oversight in the original fix made it fail to handle the
    case where the child is ptraced by its real parent.
    
    Fixed thus.

    [IA64] implements the features required for the HAVE_PCI_LEGACY code in sysfs
    
    This patch implements the features required for the HAVE_PCI_LEGACY code in
    sysfs.  It allows userspace applications to access legacy I/O ports an memory
    space using files in sysfs on a per-bus basis.  Tested on sn2, but it
    *should* work on other ia64 platforms as well (though zx1 will probably need
    machine vectors to do routing of non-base busses).

    [PKT_SCHED]: act_api.c: sync multi action order processing
    
    Sync tcf_action_init and tca_action_gd. Rename a few variables
    to make the code more easily understandable and rename the
    rtattr_failure/nlmsg_failure labels. These are usually called
    from the netlink macros, it is misleading to use them in a
    larger function without actually using netlink macros.
    
    Multi action orders were processed differently before,
    tcf_action_init skipped empty ones while tca_action_gd stopped
    at the first empty one. This patch makes both stop at the first
    empty one.

    [PKT_SCHED]: tc filter extension API
    
    The tcf_exts API abstracts extensions such as actions/policers
    into a generic layer and reduces the knowledge inside classifiers
    to the minimum required. It isolates the validation code into
    its own function to allow classifiers to validate all input
    data before making changes and thus avoids the need to undo changes
    if a extension configuration request cannot be fullfilled.
    
    Adds missing locking when adding a action/police extension to an
    already existing filter. Acquiring  dev->queue_lock makes sure we
    don't change the action/police in the middle of a classification.
    Noted by Patrick McHardy.
    
    As a nice side effect, using this API removes the existing
    ifdef clutter.
    
    Usage:
      The classifier holds struct tcf_exts which may be empty if no
      extensions are compiled in. It then calls tcf_exts_validate
      when a new change request was received and provides a temporary
      tcf_exts copy to store the change requests. Given it succeeded
      the classifier may change its own parameters and at the end
      call tcf_exts_change to commit the changes and replace the
      existing extension configuration with the new one. The classifier
      is responsible to destroy his temporary copy if any of its own
      validation checks fail.
    
      The classifier specific TLV types must be exported to the extensions
      API via tcf_ext_map.
    
      Destroying the extensions is as easy as calling tcf_exts_destroy.
    
      The extensions are executed by the classifier by calling tcf_exts_exec
      which must be done as the last thing after making sure the
      filter matches. Note: A classifier might take further actions after
      the execution to tcf_exts_exec such as correcting its own cache to
      avoid caching results which could have been influenced by the extensions.
    
      tcf_exts_exec returns a negative error code if the filter must be
      considered unmatched, 0 on normal execution or a positive classifier
      return code (TC_ACT_*) which must be returned to the underlying layer
      as-is.

    [PATCH] cciss update to version 2.6.4
    
    This patch removes support for 2 controllers that were recently
    cancelled and it adds support for the P600, a cciss based SAS
    controller due to ship in late March/early April '05.
    Neither of these controllers have made it to the field.

    Clean up stack growth checks and move them into a common function.
    
    The grows-up and grows-down cases had all the same issues, but
    differered in the details. Additionlly, historical evolution of
    the tests had caused the result to be pretty unreadable with some
    rather long and complex conditionals.
    
    Fix it all up in a more readable helper function.
    
    This also adds the missing RLIMIT_MEMLOCK test.

    [PATCH] m68knommu: optimized bitops operations for m68knommu
    
    Here is a patch to provide faster bitops for m68knommu, using bset/bclr/bchg
    and btst instructions, that do test-and-set on m68k and coldfire processors.
    We do thus avoid the need for local_irq_save/local_irq_restore.

       (as the booting document suggests)

    [PATCH] remove IN_STRING_C
    
    IN_STRING_C was an i386-specific hack by Andi Kleen to provide out-of-line
    versions of some lib/string.c functions that aren't directly used on i386
    (because there are inline assembly versions).
    
    This can cause problems if gcc chooses to transparently replace a call to one
    string function with a call to another string function (the example Andi gave
    was a replacement of a sprintf call with a strcpy call) which generates a
    function call to the replacement function.
    
    The problems observed by Andi only occur in recent kernels without
    -fno-unit-at-a-time.
    
    With -ffreestanding it can't even cause any problems in case we'd one day drop
    the -fno-unit-at-a-time since gcc mustn't assume in a freestanding environment
    that all standard C library functions are available.
    
    The effect of this patch is a small space saving in the kernel.

    [PATCH] mark QNX4FS_RW as BROKEN
    
    Anders Larsen wrote:
    
      If you remove any code inside the #ifdef CONFIG_QNX4FS_RW we might as well
      remove the option "config QNX4FS_RW" altogether.  It's horribly broken, and
      I don't intend to fix it; while I was thinking about how to properly
      implement write-support, somebody else went away and did it.  As that
      alternative seems to work well and is being actively maintained, I won't try
      to reinvent it.

    [PATCH] lockd: fix two struct definitions
    
    Under fs/lockd/, there are two structs declared extern although they are in
    the same file.  Furtheremore, they don't have to be global since their only
    users are in the same file.
    
    Most of the changes to svc.c are only indent fixes caused by making the
    struct static.

    [PATCH] ext3: use generic_open_file to fix possible preemption bugs
    
    Ext3 is currently using a duplicate version of generic_open_file, and this
    should be fixed, before it gets out of sync.
    
    In fact, it *has* got out of sync.
    
    Apart some cosmetic changes (which are not a problem), note that it
    directly reads inode->i_size, while the generic version uses i_size_read().
    
    I'm not sure if this bug can actually be triggered, but here follows a
    possible scenario: when
    
    - a file is brought into inode cache
    - that file is either truncated or extended (i.e.  inode->i_size is changed)
      and after this it changes it's "more than 2Gb" property,
    - and process B opens that file in the meanwhile,
    
    I suppose the size check can be hurted by a race condition, doesn't it?
    
    Similar checks should probably be done for other FS's. Also, ext2 does not
    have this problem - someone fixed this problem in ext2 but not ext3? How?

    This allows automatically "correct" behaviour for sound hardware w/ known
    oddities.  For example, many cards have the headphone and line-out outputs
    swapped or headphone outputs only.

    [PATCH] Lock initializer cleanup (common headers)
    
    First part of the patch series. Define initializer macros
    
    Often used structures in the kernel are almost all declared and
    initialized by macros in the form:
    
    DEFINE_TYPE(name)
    
    Spinlocks and rwlocks are declared and initialized by:
    type name = INITIALIZER;
    
    After converting the runtime initialization of spinlocks/rwlocks to
    macro form it is consequent to change the declaration and initializion
    of global and static locks to the macro form too. This conversion
    identifies those variables as "special", common code controlled
    entities similar to list_heads, mutexes... Besides consistency and code
    clearness this also helps automatic lock validators and debugging code.
    
    The patch converts
    -rwlock_t snd_card_rwlock = RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED;
    +DEFINE_RWLOCK(snd_card_rwlock);
    and
    -static spinlock_t slave_active_lock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED;
    +static DEFINE_SPINLOCK(slave_active_lock);
    
    There is no runtime overhead or actual code change resulting out of this
    patch, other than a small reduction in the kernel source code size.
    
    The conversion was done with a script, it was verified manually and it
    was reviewed, compiled and tested as far as possible on x86, ARM, PPC.

    [PATCH] Lock initializer unifying: sound
    
    To make spinlock/rwlock initialization consistent all over the kernel,
    this patch converts explicit lock-initializers into spin_lock_init() and
    rwlock_init() calls.
    
    Currently, spinlocks and rwlocks are initialized in two different ways:
    
      lock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED
      spin_lock_init(&lock)
    
      rwlock = RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED
      rwlock_init(&rwlock)
    
    this patch converts all explicit lock initializations to
    spin_lock_init() or rwlock_init(). (Besides consistency this also helps
    automatic lock validators and debugging code.)
    
    The conversion was done with a script, it was verified manually and it
    was reviewed, compiled and tested as far as possible on x86, ARM, PPC.
    
    There is no runtime overhead or actual code change resulting out of this
    patch, because spin_lock_init() and rwlock_init() are macros and are
    thus equivalent to the explicit initialization method.
    
    That's the second batch of the unifying patches.

    [PATCH] invalidate_inode_pages2() mmap coherency fix
    
    - When invalidating pages, take care to shoot down any ptes which map them
      as well.
    
      This ensures that the next mmap access to the page will generate a major
      fault, so NFS's server-side modifications are picked up.
    
      This also allows us to call invalidate_complete_page() on all pages, so
      filesytems such as ext3 get a chance to invalidate the buffer_heads.
    
    - Don't mark in-pagetable pages as non-uptodate any more.  That broke a
      previous guarantee that mapped-into-user-process pages are always uptodate.
    
    - Check the return value of invalidate_complete_page().  It can fail if
      someone redirties a page after generic_file_direct_IO() write it back.
    
    But we still have a problem.  If invalidate_inode_pages2() calls
    unmap_mapping_range(), that can cause zap_pte_range() to dirty the pagecache
    pages.  That will redirty the page's buffers and will cause
    invalidate_complete_page() to fail.
    
    So, in generic_file_direct_IO() we do a complete pte shootdown on the file
    up-front, prior to writing back dirty pagecache.  This is only done for
    O_DIRECT writes.  It _could_ be done for O_DIRECT reads too, providing full
    mmap-vs-direct-IO coherency for both O_DIRECT reads and O_DIRECT writes, but
    permitting the pte shootdown on O_DIRECT reads trivially allows people to nuke
    other people's mapped pagecache.
    
    NFS also uses invalidate_inode_pages2() for handling server-side modification
    notifications.  But in the NFS case the clear_page_dirty() in
    invalidate_inode_pages2() is sufficient, because NFS doesn't have to worry
    about the "dirty buffers against a clean page" problem. (I think)

    [PATCH] readpage-vs-invalidate fix
    
    A while ago we merged a patch which tried to solve a problem wherein a
    concurrent read() and invalidate_inode_pages() would cause the read() to
    return -EIO because invalidate cleared PageUptodate() at the wrong time.
    
    That patch tests for (page_count(page) != 2) in invalidate_complete_page() and
    bales out if false.
    
    Problem is, the page may be in the per-cpu LRU front-ends over in
    lru_cache_add.  This elevates the refcount pending spillage of the page onto
    the LRU for real.  That causes a false positive in invalidate_complete_page(),
    causing the page to not get invalidated.  This screws up the logic in my new
    O_DIRECT-vs-buffered coherency fix.
    
    So let's solve the invalidate-vs-read in a different manner.  Over on the
    read() side, add an explicit check to see if the page was invalidated.  If so,
    just drop it on the floor and redo the read from scratch.
    
    Note that only do_generic_mapping_read() needs treatment.  filemap_nopage(),
    filemap_getpage() and read_cache_page() are already doing the
    oh-it-was-invalidated-so-try-again thing.

    [PATCH] no buddy bitmap patch revisit: for mm/page_alloc.c
    
    This patch removes bitmaps from page allocator in mm/page_alloc.c.
    
    This buddy system uses page->private field to record free page's order
    instead of using bitmaps.
    
    The algorithm of the buddy system is unchanged. Only bitmaps are removed.
    
    In this buddy system, 2 pages,a page and "buddy", can be coalesced when
    
    (buddy->private & PG_private) &&
    (page_order(page)) == (page_order(buddy)) &&
    !PageReserved(buddy) &&
    page_count(buddy) == 0
    
    this also means "buddy" is a head of continuous free pages
    of length of (1 << page_order(buddy)).
    
    bad_range() is called from inner loop of __free_pages_bulk().
    In many archs, bad_range() is only a sanity check, it will always return 0.
    But if a zone's memmap has a hole, it sometimes returns 1.
    An architecture with memory holes in a zone has to define CONFIG_HOLES_IN_ZONE.
    When CONFIG_HOLES_IN_ZONE is defined, pfn_valid() is called for checking
    whether a buddy pages is valid or not.

    [PATCH] no buddy bitmap patch revist: intro and includes
    
    Followings are patches for removing bitmaps from the buddy allocator.  This
    is benefical to memory-hot-plug stuffs, because this removes a data
    structure which must meet to a host's physical memory layout.
    
    This is one step to manage physical memory in nonlinear / discontiguous way
    and will reduce some amounts of codes to implement memory-hot-plug.
    
    This patch removes bitmaps from zone->free_area[] in include/linux/mmzone.h,
    and adds some comments on page->private field in include/linux/mm.h.
    
    non-atomic ops for changing PG_private bit is added in include/page-flags.h.
    zone->lock is always acquired when PG_private of "a free page" is changed.

    [PATCH] vm: for -mm only: remove remap_page_range() completely
    
    All in-tree references to remap_page_range() have been removed by prior
    patches in the series.  This patch, intended to be applied after some waiting
    period for people to adjust to the API change, notice __deprecated, etc., does
    the final removal of remap_page_range() as a function symbol declared within
    kernel headers and/or implemented in kernel sources.

    [PATCH] md: improve 'hash' code in linear.c
    
    The hashtable that linear uses to find the right device stores
    two pointers for every entry.
    
    The second is always one of:
       The first plus 1
       NULL
    When NULL, it is never accessed, so any value can be stored.
    
    Thus it could always be "first plus 1", and so we don't need to store
    it as it is trivial to calculate.
    
    This patch halves the size of this table, which results in some simpler
    code as well.

    [PATCH] remove the BKL by turning it into a semaphore
    
    This is the current remove-BKL patch.  I test-booted it on x86 and x64, trying
    every conceivable combination of SMP, PREEMPT and PREEMPT_BKL.  All other
    architectures should compile as well.  (most of the testing was done with the
    zaphod patch undone but it applies cleanly on vanilla -mm3 as well and should
    work fine.)
    
    this is the debugging-enabled variant of the patch which has two main
    debugging features:
    
     - debug potentially illegal smp_processor_id() use. Has caught a number
       of real bugs - e.g. look at the printk.c fix in the patch.
    
     - make it possible to enable/disable the BKL via a .config. If this
       goes upstream we dont want this of course, but for now it gives
       people a chance to find out whether any particular problem was caused
       by this patch.
    
    This patch has one important fix over the previous BKL patch: on PREEMPT
    kernels if we preempted BKL-using code then the code still auto-dropped the
    BKL by mistake.  This caused a number of breakages for testers, which
    breakages went away once this bug was fixed.
    
    Also the debugging mechanism has been improved alot relative to the previous
    BKL patch.
    
    Would be nice to test-drive this in -mm.  There will likely be some more
    smp_processor_id() false positives but they are 1) harmless 2) easy to fix up.
    We could as well find more real smp_processor_id() related breakages as well.
    
    The most noteworthy fact is that no BKL-using code was found yet that relied
    on smp_processor_id(), which is promising from a compatibility POV.

    [PATCH] vmtrunc: restart_addr in truncate_count
    
    Despite its restart_pgoff pretentions, unmap_mapping_range_vma was fatally
    unable to distinguish a vma to be restarted from the case where that vma
    has been freed, and its vm_area_struct reused for the top part of a
    !new_below split of an isomorphic vma yet to be scanned.
    
    The obvious answer is to note restart_vma in the struct address_space, and
    cancel it when that vma is freed; but I'm reluctant to enlarge every struct
    inode just for this.  Another answer is to flag valid restart in the
    vm_area_struct; but vm_flags is protected by down_write of mmap_sem, which
    we cannot take within down_write of i_sem.  If we're going to need yet
    another field, better to record the restart_addr itself: restart_vma only
    recorded the last restart, but a busy tree could well use more.
    
    Actually, we don't need another field: we can neatly (though naughtily)
    keep restart_addr in vm_truncate_count, provided mapping->truncate_count
    leaps over those values which look like a page-aligned address.  Zero
    remains good for forcing a scan (though now interpreted as restart_addr 0),
    and it turns out no change is needed to any of the vm_truncate_count
    settings in dup_mmap, vma_link, vma_adjust, move_one_page.

    [PATCH] vmtrunc: vm_truncate_count race caution
    
    Fix some unlikely races in respect of vm_truncate_count.
    
    Firstly, it's supposed to be guarded by i_mmap_lock, but some places copy a
    vma structure by *new_vma = *old_vma: if the compiler implements that with a
    bytewise copy, new_vma->vm_truncate_count could be munged, and new_vma later
    appear up-to-date when it's not; so set it properly once under lock.
    
    vma_link set vm_truncate_count to mapping->truncate_count when adding an empty
    vma: if new vmas are being added profusely while vmtruncate is in progess,
    this lets them be skipped without scanning.
    
    vma_adjust has vm_truncate_count problem much like it had with anon_vma under
    mprotect merge: when merging be careful not to leave vma marked as up-to-date
    when it might not be, lest unmap_mapping_range in progress - set
    vm_truncate_count 0 when in doubt.  Similarly when mremap moving ptes from one
    vma to another.
    
    Cut a little code from __anon_vma_merge: now vma_adjust sets "importer" in the
    remove_next case (to get its vm_truncate_count right), its anon_vma is already
    linked by the time __anon_vma_merge is called.

    [PATCH] vmtrunc: unmap_mapping dropping i_mmap_lock
    
    vmtruncate (or more generally, unmap_mapping_range) has been observed
    responsible for very high latencies: the lockbreak work in unmap_vmas is good
    for munmap or exit_mmap, but no use while mapping->i_mmap_lock is held, to
    keep our place in the prio_tree (or list) of a file's vmas.
    
    Extend the zap_details block with i_mmap_lock pointer, so unmap_vmas can
    detect if that needs lockbreak, and break_addr so it can notify where it left
    off.
    
    Add unmap_mapping_range_vma, used from both prio_tree and nonlinear list
    handlers.  This is what now calls zap_page_range (above unmap_vmas), but
    handles the lockbreak and restart issues: letting unmap_mapping_range_ tree or
    list know when they need to start over because lock was dropped.
    
    When restarting, of course there's a danger of never making progress.  Add
    vm_truncate_count field to vm_area_struct, update that to mapping->
    truncate_count once fully scanned, skip up-to-date vmas without a scan (and
    without dropping i_mmap_lock).
    
    Further danger of never making progress if a vma is very large: when breaking
    out, save restart_vma and restart_addr (and restart_pgoff to confirm, in case
    vma gets reused), to help continue where we left off.

    [PATCH] vmtrunc: restore unmap_vmas zap_bytes
    
    The low-latency unmap_vmas patch silently moved the zap_bytes test after the
    TLB finish and lockbreak and regather: why?  That not only makes zap_bytes
    redundant (might as well use ZAP_BLOCK_SIZE), it makes the unmap_vmas level
    redundant too - it's all about saving TLB flushes when unmapping a series of
    small vmas.
    
    Move zap_bytes test back before the lockbreak, and delete the curious comment
    that a small zap block size doesn't matter: it's true need_flush prevents TLB
    flush when no page has been unmapped, but unmapping pages in small blocks
    involves many more TLB flushes than in large blocks.

    [PATCH] vmtrunc: truncate_count not atomic
    
    Why is mapping->truncate_count atomic?  It's incremented inside i_mmap_lock
    (and i_sem), and the reads don't need it to be atomic.
    
    And why smp_rmb() before call to ->nopage?  The compiler cannot reorder the
    initial assignment of sequence after the call to ->nopage, and no cpu (yet!)
    can read from the future, which is all that matters there.
    
    And delete totally bogus reset of truncate_count from blkmtd add_device.
    truncate_count is all about detecting i_size changes: i_size does not change
    there; and if it did, the count should be incremented not reset.

    [PATCH] debug sched domains before attach
    
    Change the sched-domain debug routine to be called on a per-CPU basis, and
    executed before the domain is actually attached to the CPU.  Previously, all
    CPUs would have their new domains attached, and then the debug routine would
    loop over all of them.
    
    This has two advantages: First, there is no longer any theoretical races: we
    are running the debug routine on a domain that isn't yet active, and should
    have no racing access from another CPU.  Second, if there is a problem with a
    domain, the validator will have a better chance to catch the error and print a
    diagnostic _before_ the domain is attached, which may take down the system.
    
    Also, change reporting of detected error conditions to KERN_ERR instead of
    KERN_DEBUG, so they have a better chance of being seen in a hang on boot
    situation.
    
    The patch also does an unrelated (and harmless) cleanup in migration_thread().

    [PATCH] Fix smp_processor_id() warning in numa_node_id()
    
    The patch below fixes smp_processor_id() warnings that are triggered by
    numa_node_id().
    
    All uses of numa_node_id() in mm/mempolicy.c seem to use it as a 'hint'
    only, not as a correctness number.  Once a node is established, it's used
    in a preemption-safe way.  So the simple fix is to disable the checking for
    numa_node_id().  But additional review would be more than welcome, because
    this patch turns off the preemption-checking of numa_node_id() permanently.

    [PATCH] idle thread preemption fix
    
    The early bootup stage is pretty fragile because the idle thread is not yet
    functioning as such and so we need preemption disabled.  Whether the bootup
    fails or not seems to depend on timing details so e.g.  the presence of
    SCHED_SMT makes it go away.
    
    Disabling preemption explicitly has another advantage: the atomicity check
    in schedule() will catch early-bootup schedule() calls from now on.
    
    The patch also fixes another preempt-bkl buglet: interrupt-driven
    forced-preemption didnt go through preempt_schedule() so it resulted in
    auto-dropping of the BKL.  Now we go through preempt_schedule() which
    properly deals with the BKL.

    [PATCH] sched: fix scheduling latencies for !PREEMPT kernels
    
    This patch adds a handful of cond_resched() points to a number of key,
    scheduling-latency related non-inlined functions.
    
    This reduces preemption latency for !PREEMPT kernels.  These are scheduling
    points complementary to PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY scheduling points (might_sleep()
    places) - i.e.  these are all points where an explicit cond_resched() had
    to be added.
    
    Has been tested as part of the -VP patchset.

    From: Bernard Blackham <bernard@blackham.com.au>
    
    The patch sched-fix-scheduling-latencies-in-mttr in recent -mm kernels has
    the bad side-effect of re-enabling interrupts even if they were disabled.
    This caused bugs in Software Suspend 2 which reenabled MTRRs whilst
    interrupts were already disabled.

    [PATCH] sched: net: fix scheduling latencies in netstat
    
    The attached patch fixes long scheduling latencies caused by access to the
    /proc/net/tcp file.  The seqfile functions keep softirqs disabled for a
    very long time (i've seen reports of 20+ msecs, if there are enough sockets
    in the system).  With the attached patch it's below 100 usecs.
    
    The cond_resched_softirq() relies on the implicit knowledge that this code
    executes in process context and runs with softirqs disabled.
    
    Potentially enabling softirqs means that the socket list might change
    between buckets - but this is not an issue since seqfiles have a 4K
    iteration granularity anyway and /proc/net/tcp is often (much) larger than
    that.

    [PATCH] preempt cleanup
    
    This is another generic fallout from the voluntary-preempt patchset: a
    cleanup of the cond_resched() infrastructure, in preparation of the latency
    reduction patches.  The changes:
    
     - uninline cond_resched() - this makes the footprint smaller,
       especially once the number of cond_resched() points increase.
    
     - add a 'was rescheduled' return value to cond_resched. This makes it
       symmetric to cond_resched_lock() and later latency reduction patches
       rely on the ability to tell whether there was any preemption.
    
     - make cond_resched() more robust by using the same mechanism as
       preempt_kernel(): by using PREEMPT_ACTIVE. This preserves the task's
       state - e.g. if the task is in TASK_ZOMBIE but gets preempted via
       cond_resched() just prior scheduling off then this approach preserves
       TASK_ZOMBIE.
    
     - the patch also adds need_lockbreak() which critical sections can use
       to detect lock-break requests.

    [PATCH] improve preemption on SMP
    
    SMP locking latencies are one of the last architectural problems that cause
    millisec-category scheduling delays.  CONFIG_PREEMPT tries to solve some of
    the SMP issues but there are still lots of problems remaining: spinlocks
    nested at multiple levels, spinning with irqs turned off, and non-nested
    spinning with preemption turned off permanently.
    
    The nesting problem goes like this: if a piece of kernel code (e.g.  the MM
    or ext3's journalling code) does the following:
    
    	spin_lock(&spinlock_1);
    	...
    	spin_lock(&spinlock_2);
    	...
    
    then even with CONFIG_PREEMPT enabled, current kernels may spin on
    spinlock_2 indefinitely.  A number of critical sections break their long
    paths by using cond_resched_lock(), but this does not break the path on
    SMP, because need_resched() *of the other CPU* is not set so
    cond_resched_lock() doesnt notice that a reschedule is due.
    
    to solve this problem i've introduced a new spinlock field,
    lock->break_lock, which signals towards the holding CPU that a
    spinlock-break is requested by another CPU.  This field is only set if a
    CPU is spinning in a spinlock function [at any locking depth], so the
    default overhead is zero.  I've extended cond_resched_lock() to check for
    this flag - in this case we can also save a reschedule.  I've added the
    lock_need_resched(lock) and need_lockbreak(lock) methods to check for the
    need to break out of a critical section.
    
    Another latency problem was that the stock kernel, even with CONFIG_PREEMPT
    enabled, didnt have any spin-nicely preemption logic for the following,
    commonly used SMP locking primitives: read_lock(), spin_lock_irqsave(),
    spin_lock_irq(), spin_lock_bh(), read_lock_irqsave(), read_lock_irq(),
    read_lock_bh(), write_lock_irqsave(), write_lock_irq(), write_lock_bh().
    Only spin_lock() and write_lock() [the two simplest cases] where covered.
    
    In addition to the preemption latency problems, the _irq() variants in the
    above list didnt do any IRQ-enabling while spinning - possibly resulting in
    excessive irqs-off sections of code!
    
    preempt-smp.patch fixes all these latency problems by spinning irq-nicely
    (if possible) and by requesting lock-breaks if needed.  Two
    architecture-level changes were necessary for this: the addition of the
    break_lock field to spinlock_t and rwlock_t, and the addition of the
    _raw_read_trylock() function.
    
    Testing done by Mark H Johnson and myself indicate SMP latencies comparable
    to the UP kernel - while they were basically indefinitely high without this
    patch.
    
    i successfully test-compiled and test-booted this patch ontop of BK-curr
    using the following .config combinations: SMP && PREEMPT, !SMP && PREEMPT,
    SMP && !PREEMPT and !SMP && !PREEMPT on x86, !SMP && !PREEMPT and SMP &&
    PREEMPT on x64.  I also test-booted x86 with the generic_read_trylock
    function to check that it works fine.  Essentially the same patch has been
    in testing as part of the voluntary-preempt patches for some time already.
    
    NOTE to architecture maintainers: generic_raw_read_trylock() is a crude
    version that should be replaced with the proper arch-optimized version
    ASAP.

    This patch removes two outdated/misleading comments from the CPU scheduler.
    
    1) The first comment removed is simply incorrect.  The function it

    2) The second comment is a leftover from when the "if" block it comments
       on contained a goto.  It does not any more, and the comment doesn't make
       sense.
    
    There isn't really a reason to add different comments, though someone might
    feel differently in the case of the second one.  I'll leave adding a
    comment to anybody who wants to - more important to just get rid of them

    [PATCH] sched: remove_interactive_credit
    
    Special casing tasks by interactive credit was helpful for preventing fully
    cpu bound tasks from easily rising to interactive status.
    
    However it did not select out tasks that had periods of being fully cpu
    bound and then sleeping while waiting on pipes, signals etc.  This led to a
    more disproportionate share of cpu time.
    
    Backing this out will no longer special case only fully cpu bound tasks,
    and prevents the variable behaviour that occurs at startup before tasks
    declare themseleves interactive or not, and speeds up application startup
    slightly under certain circumstances.  It does cost in interactivity
    slightly as load rises but it is worth it for the fairness gains.

    [PATCH] sched: requeue_granularity
    
    Change the granularity code to requeue tasks at their best priority instead
    of changing priority while they're running.  This keeps tasks at their top

    We can requeue tasks for cheaper then doing a complete dequeue followed by

    [PATCH] sched: adjust_timeslice_granularity
    
    The minimum timeslice was decreased from 10ms to 5ms.  In the process, the

    Timeslice proportion has been increased substantially for -niced tasks.  As
    a result of this kernel threads have much larger timeslices than they
    previously had.
    
    Change kernel threads' nice value to -5 to bring their timeslice back in

    likely to cause large latencies under periods of system stress for normal
    nice 0 tasks.

    [PATCH] sched: active_load_balance() fixlet
    
    There is a small problem with the active_load_balance() patch that Darren
    sent out last week.  As soon as we discover a potential 'target_cpu' from
    'cpu_group' to try to push tasks to, we cease considering other CPUs in
    that group as potential 'target_cpu's.  We break out of the
    for_each_cpu_mask() loop and try to push tasks to that CPU.  The problem is
    that there may well be other idle cpus in that group that we should also
    try to push tasks to.  Here is a patch to fix that small problem.  The
    solution is to simply move the code that tries to push the tasks into the
    for_each_cpu_mask() loop and do away with the whole 'target_cpu' thing
    entirely.  Compiled & booted on a 16-way x440.

    [PATCH] sched: more agressive wake_idle()
    
    This patch addresses some problems with wake_idle().  Currently wake_idle()
    will wake a task on an alternate cpu if:
    
    1) task->cpu is not idle
    2) an idle cpu can be found
    
    However the span of cpus to look for is very limited (only the task->cpu's
    sibling).  The scheduler should find the closest idle cpu, starting with
    the lowest level domain, then going to higher level domains if allowed
    (doamin has flag SD_WAKE_IDLE).  This patch does this.
    
    This and the other two patches (also to be submitted) combined have
    provided as much at 5% improvement on that "online transaction DB workload"
    and 2% on the industry standard J@EE workload.
    
    I asked Martin Bligh to test these for regression, and he did not find any.
     I would like to submit for inclusion to -mm and barring any problems
    eventually to mainline.

    If you build a standard kernel with gcc < 3.4 then
    ia64_spinlock_contention_pre3_4 is defined.  But a standard kernel does not
    have ia64_spinlock_contention_pre3_4_end, that label is only added by the
    kdb patch.  To get the backtrace profiling with gcc < 3.4, the _end label
    needs to be added as part of the kernprof patch, then I will remove it from
    kdb.

    [PATCH] initramfs: unprivileged image creation
    
    This patch makes several tweaks so that an initramfs image can be
    completely created by an unprivileged user.  It should maintain
    compatibility with previous initramfs early userspace cpio/image creation
    and it updates documentation.
    
    There are a few very important tweaks:
    
    CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE is now either a single cpio archive that is
    directly used or a list of directories and files for building a cpio
    archive for the initramfs image.  Making the cpio archive listable in
    CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE makes the cpio step more official and automated so
    that it doesn't have to be copied by hand to usr/initramfs_data.cpio (I
    think this was broken anyway and would be overwritten).  The alternative
    list of directories *and* files means that files can be install in a "root"
    directory and device-special files can be listed in a file list.
    
    CONFIG_ROOT_UID and CONFIG_ROOT_GID are now available for doing simple
    user/group ID translation.  That means that user ID 500, group ID 500 can
    create all the files in the "root" directory, but that they can all be
    owned by user ID 0, group ID 0 in the cpio image.
    
    Various documentation updates to pull it all together.
    
    Removal of old cruft that was unused/misleading.

    [PATCH] ext3 htree telldir() fix
    
    telldir() is broken on large ext3 dir_index'd directories because
    getdents() gives d_off==0 for the first entry
    
    Here's a patch which fixes the problem, but note the following warning
    from the readdir man page:
    
           According to POSIX, the dirent structure contains a field char d_name[]
           of  unspecified  size,  with  at most NAME_MAX characters preceding the
           terminating null character.  Use of other fields will harm  the  porta-
           bility  of  your  programs.
    
    Also, as always, telldir() and seekdir() are truly awful interfaces
    because they implicitly assume that (a) a directory is a linear data
    structure, and (b) that the position in a directory can be expressed
    in a cookie which hsa only 31 bits on 32-bit systems.
    
    So there will be hash colliions that will cause programs that assume
    that seekdir(dirent->d_off) will always return the next directory
    entry to sometimes lose directory entries in the
    not-as-unlikely-as-we-would wish case of a 31-bit hash collision.
    Really, any program which is using telldir/seekdir really should be
    rewritten to not use these interfaces if at all possible.  So with
    these caveats....
    
    
    What we need to do is wire '.' and '..' to have hash values of (0,0) and
    (2,0), respectively, without ignoring other existing dirents with colliding
    hashes.  (In those cases the programs will break, but they are statistically
    rare, and there's not much we can do in those cases anyway.)

    [PATCH] INITRAMFS: allow no trailer
    
    According to "initramfs buffer format -- third draft"
    http://lwn.net/2002/0117/a/initramfs-buffer-format.php3 "the cpio
    "TRAILER!!!" entry (cpio end-of-archive) is optional, but is not ignored"
    
    The kernel handling does not follow this spec.  If you add null padding
    after an uncompressed cpio without TRAILER!!!  the kernel complains "no
    cpio magic".  In a gzipped archive one gets "junk in gzipped archive"
    without the TRAILER!!!
    
    This patch changes the state transitions so the kernel will follow the spec.
    
    Tested: padded uncompressed, padded compressed, unpadded compressed (error)
    and trailing junk in compressed (error)
    
    ===
    
    I have a boot loader that knows how to load files, determine their size,
    and advance to the next 4-byte boundary and reports the total size of the
    files loaded.  It doesn't understand about converting this number to some
    ASCII representation.
    
    With this patch I can embed the contents of a file padded with NULs
    with out knowing the exact size of the file with the following files:
    
    1) file containing cpio header & file name, padded to 4 bytes
    2) contents of file
    3) pad file of zeros, the size at least as large as the that specified
       for the file.
    
    hpa points out that you should be careful with the headers, use unique
    inode numbers and/or add a cpio header with just TRAILER!!!  to reset the
    inode hash table to avoid unwanted hard links.  I just put this sequence as
    the last files loaded.

    [PATCH] ppc64: IOMMU cleanups: Main cleanup patch
    
    Earlier cleanup efforts of the ppc64 IOMMU code have mostly been targeted
    at simplifying the allocation schemes and modularising things for the
    various platforms.  The IOMMU init functions are still a mess.  This is an
    attempt to clean them up and make them somewhat easier to follow.
    
    The new rules are:
    
    1. iommu_init_early_<arch> is called before any PCI/VIO init is done
    2. The pcibios fixup routines will call the iommu_{bus,dev}_setup functions
       appropriately as devices are added.
    
    TCE space allocation has changed somewhat:
    
    * On LPARs, nothing is really different. ibm,dma-window properties are still
      used to determine table sizes.
    * On pSeries SMP-mode (non-LPAR), the full TCE space per PHB is split up
      in 256MB chunks, each handed out to one child bus/slot as needed. This
      makes current max 7 child buses per PHB, something we're currently below
      on all machine models I'm aware of.
    * Exception to the above: Pre-POWER4 machines with Python PHBs have a full
      GB of DMA space allocated at the PHB level, since there are no EADS-level
      tables on such systems.
    * PowerMac and Maple still work like before: all buses/slots share one table.
    * VIO works like before, ibm,my-dma-window is used like before.
    * iSeries has not been touched much at all, besides the changed unit of
      the it_size variable in struct iommu_table.
    
    Other things changed:
    * Powermac and maple PCI/IOMMU inits have been changed a bit to conform to
      the new init structure
    * pci_dma_direct.c has been renamed pci_direct_iommu.c to match
      pci_iommu.c (see separate patch)
    * Likewise, a couple of the pci direct init functions have been renamed.

    [PATCH] ppc64: IOMMU cleanups: rename pci_dma_direct.c
    
    This patch renames pci_dma_direct.c to pci_direct_iommu.c to comply to the
    naming convention of the other iommu files.
    
    This is part of the iommu cleanup, but broken out as a separate patch since
    for mainline, a BK rename is more appropriate.  Still, we need a patch to
    apply for non-BK-based trees (-mm)

    [PATCH] ppc64: use newer RTAS call when available
    
    This patch is from Nathan Fontenot <nfont@austin.ibm.com> originally.
    
    The PPC64 EEH code needs a small update to start using the
    ibm,read-slot-reset-state2 rtas call if available.  The currently used
    ibm,read-slot-reset-state call will be going away on future machines.
    
    This patch attempts to use the newer rtas call if available and falls back
    the older version otherwise.  This will maintain EEH slot checking
    capabilities on all future and current firmware levels.

    [PATCH] ppc64: add performance monitor register information to processor.h
    
    Most special purpose registers on the ppc64 have both the SPR number, and
    the various fields within the register defined in asm-ppc64/processor.h.
    So far that's not true for the performance counter control registers, MMCR0
    and MMCRA.  They have the SPR numbers defined, but the internal fields are
    defined in the oprofile code and (just a few) in traps.c where they're
    actually used.
    
    This patch moves all the MMCR0 and MMCRA definitions, plus the MSR
    performance monitor bit, MSR_PMM, into processor.h.

    OOM kills have been observed with 70% of the pages in lowmem being in the

    throttle and wait for IO completion, instead of OOM killing.

    Patch from Deepak Saxena
    
    The IXP46x chips from Intel include the same I2C controller as found
    on the IOP3xx.  This patch adds a hook to the platform-level init code
    to add that device to the device tree if running on a 46x CPU. A
    separate patch has been sent upstream via Greg Kroah-Hartman for the changes to the
    I2C driver to support both IOP and IXP systems.
    
    While at it, we fix a minor issue with the code where we were sending
    the wrong ptr to platform_add_devices(). I am not sure how it ever
    worked...

    store was one that _still_ has a DMA engine that cannot even DMA to
    all 32 bits (it's limited to 28 bits).  Hard to believe, but true (the
    card in question is a "SoundBlaster Live! 24-bit" with a CA0106 chip;
    stay away from that one if you can...).
    
    Anyhow, since I don't like it when PCI cards don't work in my machine,
    I created the attached patch which adds a new machine-vector to enable
    support of such broken cards.
    
    With the patch applied, you can either configure the kernel for
    "HP-zx1/sx1000+swiotlb" or configure for "generic" and boot with
    option "machvec=hpzx1_swiotlb" to enable support for broken PCI
    devices.
    
    The patch works as follows: the new machvec implements a I/O MMU which
    will use the hardware I/O MMU whenever possible but fall back on the
    software I/O TLB when encountering a device that can't be supported by
    the hardware I/O MMU.  Fortunately, we don't have to mess with
    MAX_DMA_ADDRESS or create a new zone: the software I/O TLB allocates
    its memory as low as possible and early in the boot-process, so on any
    machine with low memory, we're pretty much guaranteed that we'll get a
    reasonable amount of low memory, which is all we need to properly support
    broken PCI cards.
    
    Note that I made a small change to swiotlb.c: I added a
    swiotlb_init_with_default_size() function to let the new I/O MMU
    initialize the software I/O TLB with less than 64MB (which is way too
    much for the limited uses we'll see for the broken PCI devices; for
    example, the CA0106 chip allocates only coherent buffers of about
    128KB).
    
    The patch has been tested on a zx1 machine in the generic, hpzx1, and
    hpzx1_swiotlb configuration.
    
    Thanks to Alex Williamson for the suggestion of doing this via a
    completely separate machvec.

    [PATCH] USB: ehci "hc died" on startup (chip bug workaround)
    
    This fixes OSDL bugid #3056 for at least some users, where the EHCI
    driver gets a "fatal error" IRQ on startup ... only on certain boards,
    starting with the 2.6.6 or 2.6.7 kernels.  These IRQs normally indicate
    that an invalid DMA address got passed to the controller, or something
    equally nasty and unrecoverable.
    
    But it turns out that some of these controllers (at least ALI and Intel)
    are lying.  They're issuing these IRQs without stopping, contrary to the
    EHCI spec ... so these IRQs can be recovered from.  Thanks to Christian
    Iversen for noticing that his ALI controller would continue operating,
    which was the first real break in this annoying case.
    
    This patch tests for these bogus IRQs, and ignores them ... working around
    what's clearly a chip bug.  It's not clear why we started triggering that
    bug, but at least EHCI is now usable on boards exhibiting this problem.

    [PATCH] USB: definitions for USB2 debug device, debug port
    
    This provides basic definitions to support "USB2 Debug Devices", as
    supported by certain EHCI root hub ports (from ALI, Intel, NVidia, and
    other vendors).  Docs are available at Intel's USB spec webpage.
    
    The basic idea is to help debug "legacy free" systems, with no serial port
    for a console or debugger to use.  The USB debug port uses PIO to send and
    receive at most 8 bytes of high speed data at a time, so it can support one
    I/O channel without needing _any_ of the usbcore infrastructure, or DMA,
    or IRQs.  (Cost can be 2KB rather than ~150KB.)

    Hello All,
    	As per KK's review comment received on Nov 8 about the free_shared_mem function, Iam sending the following patch.
    
    The change log includes:
    
    1. Break from the main 'for loop' if ba[i] is NULL.
    
    2. In the second level 'for loop', if ba[i][j] is NULL, instead of
    continuing as was done previously, we now free the ba[i] pointer and
    break from the main 'for loop'.
    
    3. In the 'while loop' inside the second tier 'for loop', if any of the
    three pointers (ba or ba->ba_0_org or ba->ba_1_org) is found to be NULL,
    then ba[i], ba[i][j] and the non NULL buffer pointer if any
    (ba_0_org or ba_1_org) is freed and break from the main 'for loop'.

    [PATCH] forcedeth: add ethtool get/set_settings support
    
    The patch adds ethtool get_ and set_settings support to the forcedeth nic
    driver. This allows to force a certain link speed with ethtool -s.
    
    Supported link speeds: 10 HD&FD, 100 HD&FD, 1000 FD
    
    1000 HD is not supported (probably a hardware restriction), 1000 FD is
    only supported with autonegotiation enabled.
    
    Changelog:
    - Code reorganization: move ethtool functions further down in forcedeth.c
      (no code changes within the existing ethtool functions)
    - add support for setting the link setting bits in the nic with
    autodetection in the PHY disabled (i.e. use a netdev_priv() variable
    instead of querying the PHY)
    - implement get_settings and set_settings ethtool functions.

    [PATCH] Fix sx8 device naming in sysfs
    
    Attached fixes sysfs naming of sx8 block devs to follow LANANA naming.
    
    You then get /sys/block/sx8!0, etc instead of /sys/block/sx80_0 (device
    names should be /dev/sx8/0 instead of /dev/sx80_0)

    [PATCH] r8169: missing netif_poll_enable and irq ack
    
    From: Francois Romieu <romieu@fr.zoreil.com>
    
    - (noticed by Jon D. Mason) rtl8169_wait_for_quiescence() needs to disable
      the NAPI processing but it has no reason to lock any part of the driver
      which would try to do the same at a later time. Let's reenable NAPI
      processing as soon as possible.
    - properly ack any aborted interruption: a reset of the device is not
      always enough.

    [ide] PCI quirk for ICH3-M IDE
    
    From: Jim Paris <jim@jtan.com>
    
    Bartlomiej: I have an ICH3-M controller on my laptop.  The BIOS is
    leaving the prog-if as 0x8E (primary = legacy, secondary = native).
    When the PCI interrupt is routed (either in the IDE driver's
    pci_enable_device, or earlier if pci=routeirq is used), unhandled
    interrupts cause IRQ 9 to be disabled, breaking most of my other
    hardware.  This seems to be caused by having the nonexistant secondary
    interface set to native mode.  According to the datasheet I checked,
    having different modes for primary/secondary is not an allowed
    combination anyway, so the following PCI quirk checks for this case
    and forces both interfaces to legacy if true.
    
    It may make sense to make this more generic (this problem may affect
    other PCI IDs as well), or it may be better solved in the IDE driver,
    at least when pci=routeirq is not used.  But the following patch does
    work well for me.

    [PATCH] export print_sense_internal
    
    Currently, we have scsi_print_sense and scsi_print_req_sense, but the
    linux-iscsi driver receives async messages from a target that may
    contain SCSI sense data and these messages are not tied to any
    specific command. So that we can use the scsi-ml sense printing
    capabilities the attached patch exports exports print_sense_internal
    and renames it to __scsi_print_sense.

    [PATCH] Fix up compiler inefficiencies
    
    Oh, bugger...
    
    The recent mmzone.h change triggered some very, very ugly things in
    next_zone(), is_highmem(), is_normal() and zone_idx() because it changed
    the size of "struct zone" subtly.
    
    Pointer subtraction is no fun when sizeof of object gets weird and poor
    gcc blows its brains out trying to optimize that...  This slowed down an
    ARM cross-build by a factor of 2.5.
    
    Turn the pointer subtraction tests into pointer addition tests instead
    where possible, making them trivial to deal with (and gets better code,
    in addition to faster compile).
    
    zone_idx() still does a subtraction.

    [PATCH] Driver Core: handle bridged platform bus segments
    
    During setup to access platform bus segments through bridges, the current
    platform_device_register() ignores the resource parent specified by the
    bridge.  That means it'll always detect a (false) resource conflict with
    the bridge, and fail the resource reservation step.
    
    This patch makes that code use the specified parent resource, defaulting
    to "iomem_resource" or "ioport_resource" only for a NULL parent (that is,
    for devices that aren't accessed through a bridge).

    Make pipe data structure be a circular list of pages, rather than
    a circular list of one page.
    
    This improves pipe throughput, and allows us to (eventually)
    use these lists of page buffers for moving data around efficiently.

    [PATCH] Update IOP3xx I2C bus driver
    
    The following patch is a major cleanup of the IOP3xx I2C bus driver
    that is found on Intel's IOP and IXP chipsets. The existing driver in
    the 2.6 tree uses hardcoded I/O addresses based on board configuration
    which is just going to get ugly as more chips use this unit. The update
    switches to using the driver model and passing in the I/O addresses
    via platform_device resources. The patch also updates the ID name to
    more closely match the actual usage of the device.
    
    I have tested this new driver on IXP46x systems and Dave Jiang has
    tested it on both IOP321 and IOP331 systems. ARM-specific patches
    to provide platform-level hooks will go upstream after this patch
    is integrated.
    
    An example of using the new driver (from IXP46x ARM code) follows:
    
    static struct resource ixp46x_i2c_resources[] = {
    	[0] = {
    		.start 	= 0xc8011000,
    		.end	= 0xc801101c,
    		.flags	= IORESOURCE_MEM,
    	},
    	[1] = {
    		.start 	= IRQ_IXP4XX_I2C,
    		.end	= IRQ_IXP4XX_I2C,
    		.flags	= IORESOURCE_IRQ
    	}
    };
    
    static struct platform_device ixp46x_i2c_controller = {
    	.name		= "IOP3xx-I2C",
    	.id		= 0,
    	.num_resources	= 2,
    	.resource	= &ixp46x_i2c_resources
    };
    
    static struct platform_device *ixp46x_devices[] __initdata = {
    	&ixp46x_i2c_controller
    };
    
    void __init ixp4xx_init(void)
    {
    	if (cpu_is_ixp46x()) {
    		platform_add_devices(ixp46x_devices,
    				ARRAY_SIZE(ixp46x_devices));
    	}

    [IA64] Stagger the addresses of the pernode data structures to minimize cache aliasing.
    
    Allocation of pernode structures in find_pernode_space() does not
    properly stagger the alignment of the pgdats. This causes
    aliasing of the structures in the L3 caches, ie. the same fields
    in pgdat structures for multiple nodes will index to same cache
    index in the L3.
    
    If a process is allocating a huge amount of space & many nodes must
    be scanned before finding a node with available space, allocation
    of a pages is significantly slowed by excessive cache misses.
    
    By properly staggering the locations of the pgdat structures, allocation
    times on insanely large systems is dramatically improved. On a 256 node
    512GB system, allocation of 450 GB by a single process was reduced
    from 1510 sec to 220 sec - a 7X improvement.
    
    Aside from wasting a trivial amount of space, I don't see any
    downside to staggering the allocation by 1 cacheline per node.
    
    	wasted space
    		bytes = N * (N-1) * 64
    
    	For 64 node system
    		wasted bytes = ~256K

    acpi video device enumeration: fix incorrect device list allocation
    
    It didn't allocate space for the final terminating entry,
    which caused it to overwrite the next slab entry, which in turn

    total slab cache corruption at a random time afterwards. Very

    Reported by Wakko Warner.
    
    The megaraid driver is trying to remove a non-empty directory in procfs.
    
    Trivially fixed by first unregistering the driver, which will remove all
    the per-controller files in the megaraid directory, and only _then_
    removing the megaraid /proc directory entry.

    [MTD] remove unnecessary casts from drivers/mtd/maps/nettel.c and kill two warnings
    
    I took a look at the cause for these warnings in the 2.6.10 kernel,
    
    drivers/mtd/maps/nettel.c:361: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast
    drivers/mtd/maps/nettel.c:395: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast
    
    and as far as I can see the casts in there (to unsigned long and back to
    void*) are completely unnessesary ('virt' in 'struct map_info' is a void
    __iomem *), and getting rid of those casts buys us a warning free build.

    index in both map_word and buf, therefore putting the wrong words in the
    map_word that partially contains old data and partially contains new
    data. The result: corrupt data is being written.

    [PATCH] zr36067 driver - correct jpeg app/com markers
    
    Attached patch fixes the writing of APP (application-specific) and COM
    (comment) markers in the JPEG stream as generated by the zr36050 or zr36060
    encoders, both part of the zr36067 driver.
    
    During separating those bits out of the main zoran driver, we accidently
    removed the interface through which applications can adapt those markers,
    replacing them by unchangeable (static) markers.  Some video formats,
    particularly Quicktime and AVI, require specific container-specific markers in
    the stream for interlaced streams.  Those markers specify field order and
    such.
    
    The attached patch re-adds this feature so that decoders depending on those
    container-specific markers for correct playback will work correctly.

    [PATCH] fix ROM enable/disable in r128 and radeon fb drivers
    
    Both the r128 and radeon fb drivers do bad things with the PCI BAR
    corresponding to their option ROM.  They incorrectly use the host address
    instead of the BAR address to enable the ROM, and then incorrectly lose the
    original value on unmap.  This patch fixes both problems.  Tested on Altix.

    [PATCH] pm2fb: fix fbi image display on 24 bit depth big endian
    
    Handle 24bit on big-endian by leaving the hardware in RGB and using the
    colour offset to reverse red/blue.  Leaving the hardware in RGB means that
    fbi displays images correctly (abeit fortuitously) and the console is
    correct, thanks to a recent patch to the console code correcting an endian

    [PATCH] pm2fb: fix big-endian (Sparc) support
    
    A collection of changes that taken together makes the driver work correctly on
    big-endian systems, specifically Sparc.
    
    - Remove old PM2FB_BE_APERTURE define and use __BIG_ENDIAN
      throughout. PM2FB_BE_APERTURE wasn't defined on Sparc; this
      was incorrect.
    - Replace colour mode magic numbers with suitable constants,
      and tidy colour mode handling. Use BGR not RGB at 24bit on
      big-endian.
    - Replace aperture magic numbers with constants. Rearrange code to
      emphasise second aperture is not used. Add short explanations
      of aperture settings for big endian.
    - Update comments to note that the driver now works on Sparc.
    - Revisit 32bit depth colour offsets and ensure transp is set.

    - problems with very old and brand new BIOSes from SiS were fixed,
    
    - LCD setup was simplified, allowing more display modes than before,
    
    - UMC/charter bridge type handling was added,

    VBLANK status info was corrected, etc.

    [PATCH] knfsd: nfsd_translate_wouldblocks
    
    -EAGAIN has a special treatment in the nfsd code since it's used to indicate
    that an upcall has been initiated and that a request should be dropped pending
    the upcall result.
    
    But when the break_lease functions return -EWOULDBLOCK (==-EAGAIN on most
    architectures), we actually prefer to return nfserr_jukebox.  So translate
    -EAGAIN returns to -ETIMEDOUT (which will be translated to nfserr_jukebox).
    
    Undo the mapping of -EWOULDBLOCK to nfserr_jukebox, since on most
    architectures that has the undesireable effect of mapping -EAGAIN to
    nfserr_jukebox.

    [PATCH] SELinux: enhance SELinux control of executable mappings
    
    This patch adds new permission checks to the SELinux mmap and mprotect hooks
    to enable control over the ability to make executable a mapping that can
    contain data not covered by the existing file-based permission checks.
    
    The task->self execmem permission controls the ability to create an executable
    anonymous mapping or a writable executable private file mapping.  The
    task->file execmod permission controls the ability to make executable a
    previously written private file mapping, e.g.  for text relocations.  Thanks

    [PATCH] SELinux: add dynamic context transition support to SELinux
    
    This patch for adds dynamic context transition support to SELinux via writes
    to the existing /proc/pid/attr/current interface.
    
    Previously, SELinux only supported exec-based context transitions.  This
    functionality allows privileged applications to apply privilege bracketing
    without necessarily being refactored to an exec-based model (although such a
    model has advantages in least privilege and isolation).
    
    A process must have setcurrent permission to use this mechanism at all, and
    the dyntransition permission must be granted between the old and new security
    contexts.  Multi-threaded processes are not allowed to use this operation, as
    it will yield an inconsistency among the security contexts of the threads
    sharing the same mm.
    
    Ptrace permission is revalidated against the new context if the process is
    being ptraced.

    [PATCH] SELinux scalability: convert AVC to RCU
    
    The following patch improves the scalability of SELinux by replacing the
    global avc_lock with an RCU based scheme by Kaigai Kohei.  The size of the
    cache is made tunable, to allow administrators to tune systems for different
    workloads, while statistics are exported via selinuxfs to allow AVC
    performance to be monitored at a low level.
    
    AVC nodes are also allocated now via a slab cache, and AVC references have
    been removed from the code.
    
    This code has been extensively tested and benchmarked (see benchmark results
    below).  Baseline performance is not improved, although it is clear that
    dramatic scalability improvements are achieved.
    
    Baseline performance and networking scalability are areas where work is
    ongoing (in particular, we need to add caching of some network security
    objects so that we don't fallback to policy database lookups on each
    permission call).

    [PATCH] task_struct.exit_state usage
    
    I just did a quick audit of the use of exit_state and the EXIT_* bit
    macros.  I guess I didn't really review these changes very closely when you
    did them originally.  :-(
    
    I found several places that seem like lossy cases of query-replace without
    enough thought about the code.  Linus has previously said the >= tests
    ought to be & tests instead.  But for exit_state, it can only ever be 0,
    EXIT_DEAD, or EXIT_ZOMBIE--so a nonzero test is actually the same as
    testing & (EXIT_DEAD|EXIT_ZOMBIE), and maybe its code is a tiny bit better.
     The case like in choose_new_parent is just confusing, to have the
    always-false test for EXIT_* bits in ->state there too.
    
    The two cases in wants_signal and do_process_times are actual regressions
    that will give us back old bugs in race conditions.  These places had
    s/TASK/EXIT/ but not s/state/exit_state/, and now there tests for exiting
    tasks are now wrong and never catching them.  I take it back: there is no
    regression in wants_signal in practice I think, because of the PF_EXITING
    test that makes the EXIT_* state checks superfluous anyway.  So that is
    just another cosmetic case of confusing code.  But in do_process_times,
    there is that SIGXCPU-while-exiting race condition back again.

    [PATCH] move waitchld_exit from task_struct to signal_struct
    
    There is really no point in each task_struct having its own waitchld_exit.
    In the only use of it, the waitchld_exit of each thread in a group gets
    woken up at the same time.  So, there might as well just be one wait queue
    for the whole thread group.  This patch does that by moving the field from
    task_struct to signal_struct.  It should have no effect on the behavior,
    but saves a little work and a little storage in the multithreaded case.

    [PATCH] fix ptracer death race yielding bogus BUG_ON
    
    There is a BUG_ON in ptrace_stop that hits if the thread is not ptraced.
    However, there is no synchronization between a thread deciding to do a
    ptrace stop and so going here, and its ptracer dying and so detaching from
    it and clearing its ->ptrace field.
    
    The RHEL3 2.4-based kernel has a backport of a slightly older version of
    the 2.6 signals code, which has a different but equivalent BUG_ON.  This
    actually bit users in practice (when the debugger dies), but was
    exceedingly difficult to reproduce in contrived circumstances.  We moved
    forward in RHEL3 just by removing the BUG_ON, and that fixed the real user
    problems even though I was never able to reproduce the scenario myself.
    So, to my knowledge this scenario has never actually been seen in practice
    under 2.6.  But it's plain to see from the code that it is indeed possible.
    
    This patch removes that BUG_ON, but also goes further and tries to handle
    this case more gracefully than simply avoiding the crash.  By removing the
    BUG_ON alone, it becomes possible for the real parent of a process to see
    spurious SIGCHLD notifications intended for the debugger that has just
    died, and have its child wind up stopped unexpectedly.  This patch avoids
    that possibility by detecting the case when we are about to do the ptrace
    stop but our ptracer has gone away, and simply eliding that ptrace stop
    altogether as if we hadn't been ptraced when we hit the interesting event
    (signal or ptrace_notify call for syscall tracing or something like that).

    [PATCH] fix stop signal race
    
    The `sig_avoid_stop_race' checks fail to catch a related race scenario that
    can happen.  I don't think this has been seen in nature, but it could
    happen in the same sorts of situations where the observed problems come up
    that those checks work around.  This patch takes a different approach to
    catching this race condition.  The new approach plugs the hole, and I think
    is also cleaner.
    
    The issue is a race between one CPU processing a stop signal while another
    CPU processes a SIGCONT or SIGKILL.  There is a window in stop-signal
    processing where the siglock must be released.  If a SIGCONT or SIGKILL
    comes along here on another CPU, then the stop signal in the midst of being
    processed needs to be discarded rather than having the stop take place
    after the SIGCONT or SIGKILL has been generated.  The existing workaround
    checks for this case explicitly by looking for a pending SIGCONT or SIGKILL
    after reacquiring the lock.
    
    However, there is another problem related to the same race issue.  In the
    window where the processing of the stop signal has released the siglock,
    the stop signal is not represented in the pending set any more, but it is
    still "pending" and not "delivered" in POSIX terms.  The SIGCONT coming in
    this window is required to clear all pending stop signals.  But, if a stop
    signal has been dequeued but not yet processed, the SIGCONT generation will
    fail to clear it (in handle_stop_signal).  Likewise, a SIGKILL coming here
    should prevent the stop processing and make the thread die immediately
    instead.  The `sig_avoid_stop_race' code checks for this by examining the
    pending set to see if SIGCONT or SIGKILL is in it.  But this fails to
    handle the case where another CPU running another thread in the same
    process has already dequeued the signal (so it no longer can be found in
    the pending set).  We must catch this as well, so that the same problems do
    not arise when another thread on another CPU acted real fast.
    
    I've fixed this dumping the `sig_avoid_stop_race' kludge in favor of a
    little explicit bookkeeping.  Now, dequeuing any stop signal sets a flag
    saying that a pending stop signal has been taken on by some CPU since the
    last time all pending stop signals were cleared due to SIGCONT/SIGKILL.
    The processing of stop signals checks the flag after the window where it
    released the lock, and abandons the signal the flag has been cleared.  The
    code that clears pending stop signals on SIGCONT generation also clears
    this flag.  The various places that are trying to ensure the process dies
    quickly (SIGKILL or other unhandled signals) also clear the flag.  I've
    made this a general flags word in signal_struct, and replaced the
    stop_state field with flag bits in this word.

    [PATCH] __getblk_slow can loop forever when pages are partially mapped
    
    When a block device is accessed via read/write, it is possible for some of
    the buffers on a page to be mapped and others not.  __getblk and friends
    assume this can't happen, and can end up looping forever when pages have
    some unmapped buffers.  Picture:
    
    lseek(/dev/xxx, 2048, SEEK_SET)
    write(/dev/xxx, 2048 bytes)
    
    Assuming the block size is 1k, page 0 has 4 buffers, two are mapped by
    __block_prepare_write and two are not.  Next, another process triggers
    getblk(/dev/xxx, blocknr = 0);
    
    __getblk_slow will loop forever.  __find_get_block fails because the buffer
    isn't mapped.  grow_dev_page does nothing because there are buffers on the
    page with the correct size.  madhav@veritas.com and others at Veritas
    tracked this down.
    
    The fix below has two parts.  First, it changes __find_get_block to avoid
    the buffer_error warnings when it finds unmapped buffers on the page.
    
    Second, it changes grow_dev_page to map the buffers on the page by calling
    init_page_buffers.  init_page_buffers is changed so we don't stomp on
    uptodate bits for the buffers.

    [PATCH] IRQ resource deallocation: ia64
    
    This is an ia64 portion of IRQ resource deallocation. It implements
    pcibios_disable_device() and acpi_unregister_gsi() for ia64.
    
        o acpi_unregister_gsi()
    
            Summary of changes for implementing this interface:
    
            - Add new function iosapic_unregister_intr() into
              arch/ia64/kernel/iosapic.c. This function frees an interrupt
              vector and related data structures.
    
            - Add new function free_irq_vector() into
              arch/ia64/kernel/irq_ia64.c. This frees an unused vector.
    
            - Change assign_irq_vector() to be able to support
              free_irq_vector().
    
        o pcibios_disable_device()
    
            This calls acpi_pci_irq_disable() to deallocate IRQ resources.

    [PATCH] IRQ resource deallocation: ACPI
    
    Architecture dependent IRQ resources such as interrupt vector for PCI
    devices are allocated at pci_enable_device() time on i386, x86-64 and
    ia64 platform. Today, however, these IRQ resources are never
    deallocated even if they are no longer used. The following set of
    patches adds supports to deallocate IRQ resources at
    pci_disable_device() time.
    
    The motivation of the set of patches is as follows:
    
        - IRQ resources such as interrupt vectors should be freed if they
          are no longer used because the amount of these resources are
          limited. By deallocating IRQ resources, we can recycle them.
    
        - I think some hardwares will support hot-pluggable I/O units with
          I/O xAPICs in the near future. So I/O xAPIC hot-plug support by
          OS will be needed soon. IRQ resouces deallocation will be one of
          the most important stuff for I/O xAPIC hot-plug.
    
    For now, the following set of patches has ia64 implementation only.
    i386 and x86_64 implementations are TBD.
    
    
    
    
    This patch is ACPI portion of IRQ deallocation. This patch defines the
    following new interface. The implementation of this interface depends
    on each platform.
    
        o void acpi_unregister_gsi(u32 gsi)
    
            This is a opposite portion of acpi_register_gsi(). This has a
            responsibility for deallocating IRQ resources associated with
            the specified GSI number.
    
            We need to consider the case of shared interrupt. In the case
            of shared interrupt, acpi_register_gsi() is called multiple
            times for one gsi. That is, registrations and unregistrations
            can be nested.
    
            This function undoes the effect of one call to
            acpi_register_gsi(). If this matches the last registration,
            IRQ resources associated with the specified GSI number are
            freed.
    
    This patch also adds the following new function.
    
        o void acpi_pci_irq_disable (struct pci_dev *dev)
    
            This function is a opposite portion of
            acpi_pci_enable_irq(). It clears the device's linux IRQ number
            and calls acpi_unregister_gsi() to deallocate IRQ resources.

    [PATCH] fix missing wakeup in ipc/sem
    
    My patch that removed the spin_lock calls from the tail of sys_semtimedop
    introduced a bug:
    
    Before my patch was merged, every operation that altered an array called
    update_queue.  That call woke up threads that were waiting until a
    semaphore value becomes 0.  I've accidentially removed that call.
    
    The attached patch fixes that by modifying update_queue: the function now
    loops internally and wakes up all threads.  The patch also removes
    update_queue calls from the error path of sys_semtimedop: failed operations
    do not modify the array, no need to rescan the list of waiting threads.

    [PATCH] Add PR_GET_NAME
    
    A while back we added the PR_SET_NAME prctl, but no PR_GET_NAME.  I guess
    we should add this, if only to enable testing of PR_SET_NAME.

    [PATCH] panic_timeout: move to kernel.h
    
    Move 'panic_timeout' to linux/kernel.h.
    
    ipmi_watchdog.c wanted to know why panic_timeout isn't in some header file.
     However, ipmi_watchdog.c doesn't even use it, so that reference was
    deleted.  Other references now use kernel.h instead of straight extern int.

    [PATCH] make gconfig work with gtk-2.4
    
    I need this to make gconfig work under gtk-2.4.  Without this, it just
    coredumps.  There is some problem with pixmap creation/usage from XPM in
    the way it is done in gconf, so I just added some stock icons.  It is even
    prettier..;)
    
    Could someone test this still works on gtk-2.0 or 2.2 ?
    
    Changes:
    
    - change the wiget class 'button' in glade files to something known to
      glade (GtkToolButton)
    - use 'stock-id' property for toolbar buttons instead of "stock_pixmap"
    - change unknown signal "pressed" to "clicked"
    - remove manual setting of icons in gconf.c

    rcu_ctrlblk.lock is used to read the ->cur and ->next_pending

    	if (!rcp->next_pending)
    		rcu_start_batch(rcp, rsp, 1);
    
    This way, if __rcu_process_callbacks() sees incremented ->cur value,
    it must also see that ->next_pending == 0 (or rcu_start_batch() is
    already in progress on another cpu).

    [PATCH] Sync in core time granuality with filesystems
    
    This patch corrects a problem that was originally added with the nanosecond
    timestamps in stat patch.  The problem is that some file systems don't have
    enough space in their on disk inode to save nanosecond timestamps, so they
    truncate the c/a/mtime to seconds when flushing an dirty node.  In core the
    inode would have full jiffies granuality.
    
    This can be observed by programs as a timestamp that jumps backwards under
    specific loads when an inode is flushed and then reloaded from disk.
    
    The problem was already known when the original patch went in, but it
    wasn't deemed important enough at that time.  So far there has been only
    one report of it causing problems.  Now Tridge is worried that it will
    break running Excel over samba4 because Excel seems to do very anal
    timestamp checking and samba4 will supply 100ns timestamps over the
    network.
    
    This patch solves it by putting the time resolution into the superblock of
    a fs and always rounding the in core timestamps to that granuality.
    
    This also supercedes some previous ext2/3 hacks to flush the inode less
    often when only the subsecond timestamp changes.
    
    I tried to keep the overhead low, in particular it tries to keep divisions
    out of fast paths as far as possible.
    
    The patch is quite big but 99% of it is just relatively straight forward
    search'n'replace in a lot of fs.  Unconverted filesystems will default to a
    1ns granuality, but may still show the problem if they continue to use
    CURRENT_TIME.  I converted all in tree fs.
    
    One possible future extension of this would be to have two time
    granualities per superblock - one that specifies the visible resolution,
    and the other to specify how often timestamps should be flushed to disk,
    which could be tuned with a mount option per fs (e.g.  often m/atimes don't
    need to be flushed every second).  Would be easy to do as an addon if
    someone is interested.

    [PATCH] sys_stime needs a compat function
    
    I realized that the best way to get the sys_time/sys_stime problem fixed is
    to make sys_time 64 bit safe by using "time_t *" instead of "int *" and to
    introduce two proper compat functions compat_sys_time and compat_sys_stime.
    
    The prototype change of sys_time is transparent for 32 bit architectures
    because both "int" and "time_t" are 32 bit.  For 64 bit the type change
    would be wrong but luckily no 64 bit architecture uses sys_time/sys_stime
    in 64 bit mode.  The patch makes the following change:
    
    ia64     : Remove sys32_time, use compat_sys_time and
               add (!!) compat_sys_stime to compat syscall table.
    mips     : Use compat_sys_time/compat_sys_stime in 32 bit syscall table.
               Add #ifdef magic to compile sys_time/sys_stime and
               compat_sys_time/compat_sys_stime only if needed.
    parisc   : Remove sys32_time, use compat_sys_time and compat_sys_stime.
    ppc64    : remove sys32_time, ppc64_sys32_stime and ppc64_sys_stime.
               Use common compat_sys_time, compat_sys_stime and sys_stime.
    s390     : Use compat_sys_stime. Add #ifdef magic to compile
               sys_time/sys_stime and compat_sys_time/compat_sys_stime only
               if needed.
    sparc64  : Use compat_sys_time/compat_Sys_stime in 32 bit syscall table.
    um       : Remove um_time and um_stime. Use common functions sys_time and
               sys_stime. This adds a CAP_SYS_TIME check to UMs stime call.
    x86_64   : Remove sys32_time. Use compat_sys_time and compat_sys_stime
               in 32 bit syscall table.
    
    The original stime bug is fixed for mips, parisc, s390, sparc64 and
    x86_64. Can the arch-maintainers please take a look at this?
    
    From: Martin Schwidefsky <schwidefsky@de.ibm.com>
    
    Convert compat_time_t to time_t in 32 bit emulation for sys_stime and
    consolidate all the different implementation of sys_time, sys_stime and
    their 32-bit emulation parts.

    [PATCH] compile with -ffreestanding
    
    For the kernel, it would be logical to use -ffreestanding.  The kernel is
    not a hosted environment with a standard C library.
    
    The gcc option -ffreestanding is supported by both gcc 2.95 and 3.4, which
    covers the whole range of currently supported compilers.
    
    Regarding changes caused by this patch:
    
    Andi Kleen reported:
      Newer gcc rewrites sprintf(buf,"%s",str) to strcpy(buf,str) transparently.
    
    This is only true with unit-at-a-time (disabled on i386 but enabled on
    x86_64).  The Linux kernel doesn't offer a standard C library, and such
    transparent replacements of kernel functions with builtins are quite
    fragile.
    
    Even with -ffreestanding, it's still possilble to explicitely use a gcc
    builtin if desired.

    [PATCH] ext3: support for EA in inode
    
    1) intent of the patch is to get possibility to store EAs in the body of large
       inode. it saves space and improves performance in some cases
    
    2) the patch is quite simple: it works the same way original xattr does, but
       using other storage (inode body). body has priority over separate block.
       original routines (ext3_xattr_get, ext3_xattr_list, ext3_xattr_set) are
       renamed to ext3_xattr_block_*. new routines that handle inode storate are
       added (ext3_xattr_ibody_get, ext3_xattr_ibody_list, ext3_xattr_ibody_set).
       routines ext3_xattr_get, ext3_xattr_list and ext3_xattr_set allow user to
       accesss both the storages transparently
    
    3) the change makes sense on filesystem with inode size >= 256 bytes only.
       2.4 kernels don't support such a filesystems, AFAIK. 2.6 kernels do support
       and ignore EAs stored in a body w/o the patch
    
    4) debugfs and e2fsck need to be patched to deal with EAs in inode
       the patch will be sent later
    
    5) testing results:
    	a) Andrew Samba Master (tridge) has done successful tests
    	b) we've been using ea-in-inode feature in Lustre for many months

    [PATCH] Reduce i_sem usage during file sync operations
    
    We hold i_sem during the various sync() operations to prevent livelocks:
    if another thread is dirtying the file, a sync() may never return.
    
    Or at least, that used to be true when we were using the per-address_space
    page lists.  Since writeback has used radix tree traversal it is not possible
    to livelock the sync() operations, because they only visit each page a single
    time.
    
    sync_page_range() (used by O_SYNC writes) has not been holding i_sem for quite
    some time, for the above reasons.
    
    The patch converts fsync(), fdatasync() and msync() to also not hold i_sem
    during the radix-tree-based writeback.
    
    Now, we _do_ still need to hold i_sem across the file->f_op->fsync() call,
    because that is still based on a list_head walk, and is still livelockable.
    
    But in the case of msync() I deliberately left i_sem untaken.  This is because
    we're currently deadlockable in msync, because mmap_sem is already held, and
    mmap_sem nexts inside i_sem, due to direct-io.c.
    
    And yes, the ranking of down_read() veruss down() does matter:
    
    	Task A			Task B		Task C
    
    	down_read(rwsem)
    				down(sem)
    						down_write(rwsem)
    	down(sem)
    				down_read(rwsem)
    
    
    C's down_write() will cause B's down_read to block.  B holds `sem', so A will
    never release `rwsem'.
    
    So the patch fixes a hard-to-hit triple-task deadlock, but adds a possible
    livelock in msync().  It is possible to fix sys_msync() so that it takes i_sem
    outside i_mmap_sem.  Later.

    Bring the total_forks under tasklist_lock.  When most of the fork code

    Althought accuracy of total_forks is not important, it would be nice to add

    increase on fork, but nr_threads will increase on fork and decrease on the

    [PATCH] ext3: handle attempted double-delete of metadata.
    
    This patch improves ext3's ability to deal with corruption on-disk.  If we
    try to delete a metadata block twice, we confuse ext3's internal revoke
    error-checking, resulting in a BUG().  But this can occur in practice due
    to a corrupt indirect block, so we should attempt to fail gracefully.
    
    Downgrade the assert failure to a JH_EXPECT_BH failure, and return EIO when
    it occurs.

    [PATCH] ext3: handle attempted delete of bitmap blocks.
    
    This patch improves ext3's ability to deal with corruption on-disk.  If we
    ever get a corrupt inode or indirect block, then an attempt to delete it
    can end up trying to remove any block on the fs, including bitmap blocks.
    This can cause ext3 to assert-fail as we end up trying to do an ext3_forget
    on a buffer with b_committed_data set.
    
    The fix is to downgrade this to an IO error and journal abort, so that we
    take the filesystem readonly but don't bring down the whole kernel.
    
    Make J_EXPECT_JH() return a value so it can be easily tested and yet still
    retained as an assert failure if we build ext3 with full internal debugging
    enabled.  Make journal_forget() return an error code so that in this case
    the error can be passed up to the caller.
    
    This is easily reproduced with a sample ext3 fs image containing an inode
    whose direct and indirect blocks refer to a block bitmap block.  Allocating
    new blocks and then deleting that inode will BUG() with:
    
    Assertion failure in journal_forget() at fs/jbd/transaction.c:1228:
    "!jh->b_committed_data"
    
    With the fix, ext3 recovers gracefully.

    [PATCH] ext3: cleanup handling of aborted transactions.
    
    This patch improves ext3's error logging when we encounter an on-disk
    corruption.  Previously, a transaction (such as a truncate) which encountered
    many corruptions (eg.  a single highly-corrupt indirect block) would emit
    copious "aborting transaction" errors to the log.
    
    Even worse, encountering an aborted journal can count as such an error,
    leading to a flood of spurious "aborting transaction: Journal has aborted"
    errors.
    
    With the fix, only emit that message on the first error.  The patch also
    restores a missing \n in that printk path.

    shutdown when the driver is closed (unless no way out is specified) this is
    unnecessary and defeats the no way out option.

    [PATCH] Hold BKL for shorter period in generic_shutdown_super().
    
    Testing revealed long pauses of the entire system while autofs initiated
    umounts as a result of timing out the mounts.
    
    It was noticed that during a umount, the BKL is held while scanning the
    inode_list and removing and inodes that are candidates.  This patch moves
    locking until after the first pass had gone through the inode_list.
    
    Testing revelead that on an ia64 machine with a filesystem that had 8.4
    Million inodes, there were no observable pauses during the umount.  This
    was down from over 4 seconds without this patch.

    [PATCH] move irq_enter and irq_exit to common code
    
    This code is the same for all architectures with the following invariants:
    
    - arm gurantees irqs are disabled when calling irq_exit so it can call
      __do_softirq directly instead of do_softirq
    
    - arm26 is totally broken for about half a year, I didn't care for it
    
    - some architectures use softirq_pending(smp_processor_id()) instead of
      local_softirq_pending, but they always evaluate to the same
    
    This patch moves the out of line irq_exit implementation from
    kernel/irq/handle.c which depends on CONFIG_GENERIC_HARDIRQS to
    kernel/softirq.c which is always compiled, tweaks it for the arm special
    case and moves the irq_enter/irq_exit/nmi_enter/nmi_exit bits from
    asm-*/hardirq.h to linux/hardirq.h

    [PATCH] Permit nommu MAP_SHARED of memory backed files
    
    The attached patch applies some further fixes and extensions to the nommu mmap
    implementation:
    
     (1) /proc/maps distinguishes shareable private mappings and real shared
         mappings by marking the former with 's' and the latter with 'S'.
    
     (2) Rearrange and optimise the checking portion of do_mmap_pgoff() to make it
         easier to follow.
    
     (3) Only set VM_SHARED on MAP_SHARED mappings. Its presence indicates that the
         backing memory is supplied by the underlying file or chardev.
    
         VM_MAYSHARE indicates that a VMA may be shared if it's a private VMA. The
         memory for a private VMA is allocated by do_mmap_pgoff() from a kmalloc
         slab and then the file contents are read into it before returning.
    
     (4) Permit MAP_SHARED + PROT_WRITE on memory-backed files[*] and chardevs to
         indicate a contiguous area of memory when its get_unmapped_area() is
         called if the backing fs/chardev is willing.
    
         [*] file->f_mapping->backing_dev_info->memory_backed == 1
    
     (5) Require chardevs and files that support to provide a get_unmapped_area()
         file operation.
    
     (6) Made sure a private mapping of /dev/zero is possible. Shared mappings of
         /dev/zero are not currently supported because this'd need greater
         interaction of mmap with the chardev driver than is currently supported.
    
     (7) Add in some extra checks from mm/mmap.c: security, file having write
         access for a writable shared mapping, file not being in append mode.
    
     (8) Only account the mapping memory if it's allocated here; memory belonging
         to a shared chardev or file is not accounted.
    
    With this patch it should be possible to map contiguous flash files directly
    out of ROM simply by providing get_unmapped_area() for a read-only/shared
    mapping.
    
    I think that it might be worth splitting do_mmap_pgoff() up into smaller
    subfunctions: one to handle the checking, one to handle shared mappings and
    one to handle private mappings.

    [PATCH] Fix nommu MAP_SHARED handling
    
    The attached patch does the following things:
    
     (1) It uniquifies permitted overlapping VMAs (eg: MAP_SHARED on chardevs) in
         nommu_vma_tree. Identical entries break the assumptions on which rbtrees
         work. Since we don't need to share VMAs in this case, we uniquify such
         VMAs by using the pointer to the VMA. They're only kept in the tree for
         /proc/maps visibility.
    
     (2) Extracts VMA unlinking into its own function so that the source is
         adjacent to the VMA linking function.
    
     (3) No longer releases memory belonging to a shared chardev or file (the
         underlying driver is expected to provide mappable memory).
    
     (4) Frees the file attached to a VMA whether or not that VMA is shared or is
         a memory-mapped I/O mapping.

         where the debug-mode handler would normally catch it. This patch extends
         the range of detected PC values.
    
     (2) When setting up the kernel-mode exception frame from the debug-mode
         handler for a userspace debugging event, we weren't setting the LR
         register to generate a return to the exception handler epilogue.
    
     (3) sys_ptrace() now needs to "put" the inferior task_struct not "free" it as
         was done in 2.4.

    [PATCH] Further nommu /proc changes
    
    The attached patch changes the nommu procfs routines to match the nommu
    changes in patch 1/1.
    
    This is an exercise in structure renaming and handling the fact that the list
    of VMAs in the system is now held together by vma->vm_rb.

    [PATCH] Further nommu changes
    
    The attached patch further changes the nommu stuff previously changed. These
    new changes do the following:
    
     (0) Some additional variables have been defined to make nommu even compile.
    
     (1) Get rid of the alternate vm_area_struct. The nommu mmap now uses the
         normal one. There's a refcount field added to the normal one, contingent
         on !CONFIG_MMU.
    
     (2) vm_rb is now used to keep track of the VMAs in an rbtree rather than
         adding a separate list.
    
     (3) mm_tblock_struct is now vm_list_struct.
    
     (4) put_vma() now calls vma->vm_ops->close() if available on nommu.
    
     (5) A dummy generic_file_vm_ops has been provided. It does nothing, but
         permits tiny-shmem to compile.
    
         tiny-shmem and ramfs still need attention, such that files contained
         therein can be mmapped shared-writably to some extent on nommu.

    The attached patch fixes the following problems in the ELF-FDPIC binfmt

     (1) elf_fdpic_map_file() should be passed an mm_struct pointer, not NULL.
    
     (2) do_mmap() should be called with the mmap_sem held.
    
     (3) mm_struct::end_brk doesn't exist in 2.6 (debugging only).
    
     (4) Avoid debugging warnings by casting certain values to unsigned long
         before printing them.

    [PATCH] FRV: Add FDPIC ELF binary format driver
    
    The attached patch adds a new binary format driver that allows a special
    variety of ELF to be used that permits the dynamic sections that comprise an
    executable, its dynamic loader and its shared libaries and its stack and data
    to be located anywhere within the address space.
    
    This is used to provide shared libraries and shared executables (at least, as
    far as the read-only dynamic sections go) on uClinux. Not only that, but the
    same binaries can be run on MMU linux without a problem.
    
    This is achieved by:
    
     (1) Passing loadmaps to the dynamic loader (or to a statically linked
         executable) to indicate the whereabouts of the various dynamic sections.
    
     (2) Using a GOT inside the program.
    
     (3) Passing setup_arg_pages() the stack pointer to be.
    
     (4) Allowing the arch greated control over how an executable is laid out in
         memory in MMU Linux.
    
     (5) Rewriting mm/nommu.c to support MAP_PRIVATE on files, thus allowing _mmap_
         to handle sharing of private-readonly mappings.

    [PATCH] FRV: Better mmap support in uClinux
    
    The attached patch changes mm/nommu.c to better support mmap() when MMU
    support is disabled (as it is in uClinux).
    
    This was discussed on the uclibc mailing list in a thread revolving around the
    following message:
    
    	Date: Thu, 1 Apr 2004 12:05:50 +1000
    	From: David McCullough <davidm@snapgear.com>
    	To: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
    	Cc: Alexandre Oliva <aoliva@redhat.com>, uclibc@uclibc.org
    	Subject: Re: [uClibc] mmaps for malloc should be private
    	Message-ID: <20040401020550.GG3150@beast>
    
    The revised rules are:
    
     (1) Anonymous mappings can be shared or private, read or write.
    
     (2) Chardevs can be mapped shared, provided they supply a get_unmapped_area()
         file operation and use that to set the address of the mapping (as a frame
         buffer driver might do, for instance).
    
     (3) Files (and blockdevs) cannot be mapped shared since it is not really
         possible to honour this by writing any changes back to the backing device.
    
     (4) Files (or sections thereof) can be mapped read-only private, in which case
         the mapped bit will be read into memory and shared, and its address will
         be returned. Any excess beyond EOF will be cleared.
    
     (5) Files (or sections thereof) can be mapped writable private, in which case
         a private copy of the mapped bit will be read into a new bit memory, and
         its address will be returned. Any excess beyond EOF will be cleared.
    
    Mappings are per MM structure still. You can only unmap what you've mapped.
    
    Fork semantics are irrelevant, since there's no fork.
    
    A global list of VMA's is maintained to keep track of the bits of memory
    currently mapped on the system.
    
    The new binfmt makes use of (4) to implement shared libraries.

    [PATCH] kill off highmem_start_page
    
    People love to do comparisons with highmem_start_page.  However, where
    CONFIG_HIGHMEM=y and there is no actual highmem, there's no real page at
    *highmem_start_page.
    
    That's usually not a problem, but CONFIG_NONLINEAR is a bit more strict and
    catches the bogus address tranlations.
    
    There are about a gillion different ways to find out of a 'struct page' is
    highmem or not.  Why not just check page_flags?  Just use PageHighMem()
    wherever there used to be a highmem_start_page comparison.  Then, kill off
    highmem_start_page.
    
    This removes more code than it adds, and gets rid of some nasty
    #ifdefs in .c files.

    [PATCH] VM routine fixes
    
    The attached patch fixes a number of problems in the VM routines:
    
     (1) Some inline funcs don't compile if CONFIG_MMU is not set.
    
     (2) swapper_pml4 needn't exist if CONFIG_MMU is not set.
    
     (3) __free_pages_ok() doesn't counter set_page_refs() different behaviour if
         CONFIG_MMU is not set.
    
     (4) swsusp.c invokes TLB flushing functions without including the header file
         that declares them.
    
    CONFIG_SHMEM semantics:
    
    - If MMU: Always enabled if !EMBEDDED
    
    - If MMU && EMBEDDED: configurable
    
    - If !MMU: disabled

    [PATCH] GP-REL data support
    
    The attached patch makes it possible to support gp-rel addressing for small
    variables.  Since the FR-V cpu's have fixed-length instructions and plenty of
    general-purpose registers, one register is nominated as a base for the small
    data area.  This makes it possible to use single-insn accesses to access
    global and static variables instead of having to use multiple instructions.
    
    This, however, causes problems with small variables used to pinpoint the
    beginning and end of sections.  The compiler assumes it can use gp-rel
    addressing for these, but the linker then complains because the displacement
    is out of range.
    
    By declaring certain variables as arrays or by forcing them into named
    sections, the compiler is persuaded to access them as if they can be outside
    the displacement range.  Declaring the variables as "const void" type also
    works.

    [PATCH] Conntrack Hash Allocation using __get_free_pages
    
    Here is a patch that just makes it use get_free_pages to test the TLB

    the hash table buckets - a single pointer would likely suffice and it
    would cut the hash table in half, saving cache, TLB and memory.

    4) Remove __ipt_mutex_up() and __ipt_find_target_lock() which weren't
       used (even in patch-o-matic AFAICT).
    
    This cleanup takes us closer to using standard list macros everywhere,

    [PATCH] Remove Randomness in Selecting NAT IP Address
    
    We currently choose a "random" IP address to NAT to, where we have a
    range.  Martin Josefsson pointed out that he uses the SAME target in
    iptables because changing IP addresses breaks Internet banking sites
    (among others) which assume the customer will be coming from a
    consistent IP address.
    
    In fact, we spend a fair bit of effort trying to balance the number of
    connections we NAT to each IP address.  We can come pretty damn close
    just hashing the source and destination IP addresses, and it has the
    consistency property which is so desirable, as well as being faster.

    [PATCH] Don't try too hard to NAT to unique tuple
    
    On NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT or NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING, if destination NAT is not
    sufficient to create a unique tuple, we try changing the source port
    as well.  However, this is also not strictly necessary: if the tuple
    is not unique, we will also try to change the source on the
    NF_IP_POST_ROUTING hook.
    
    When we finally confirm the connection, if the tuple is still not
    unique the packet will be dropped (this is required anyway as we could
    race: the conntrack is not placed in the hash until the packet is
    about to leave the box anyway).
    
    In fact, we only need best effort *everywhere*.

    [PATCH] Remove NAT to multiple ranges

    1024-65535, and 192.168.1.10".  I implemented this because we could.
    
    But it's not actually *used* by many (any?) people, and you can
    approximate this by a random match (from patch-o-matic) if you really
    want to.  It adds complexity to the code.

     Subject: [PATCH] NFS: Use parallel read operations to do direct read requests
    
     The initial implementation of NFS direct reads was entirely synchronous.
     The direct read logic issued one NFS READ operation at a time, and waited
     for the server's reply before issuing the next one.  For large direct
     read requests, this is unnecessarily slow.
    
     This patch changes the NFS direct read path to dispatch NFS READ operations
     for a single direct read request in parallel and wait for them once.  The
     direct read path is still synchronous in nature, but because the NFS READ
     operations are going in parallel, the completion wait should be much shorter.

     on the stack.  This reduces stack utilization of nfs_direct_write_seg
     from over 900 bytes to less than 100 bytes.

     Subject: [PATCH] NFS: better handling of short writes in direct write path
    
     Immediately return control to the application if a short NFS write is
     detected in the NFS client's direct write path.  This is better behavior
     than what the direct write path does today, which could result in data
     appearing at the wrong offset in the file.
    
     Eventually this code path should retry short writes at least once before
     giving up.

     Subject: [PATCH] NFS: short write warning
    
     Recently a patch set was accepted to allow the Linux NFS client to handle
     short writes by retrying the unwritten portion of the request.  The only
     case that now results in an error is when the server makes no progress;
     that is, writes zero bytes.
    
     This patch changes the kernel log warning that is generated in that case
     to reflect the error condition more accurately.

    NFSv2/v3/v4: ESTALE should not be a permanent condition on directories.
    
    Although it usually means that someone has deleted a file on the server,
    the ESTALE error may also indicate that the sysadmin has used exportfs to
    deny our client access to the server. Most NFS implementations therefore
    consider it a non-permanent condition, and allow inodes to "recover" when
    the sysadmin re-enables access.
    If, however, you want to work with broken servers, like unfsd, that reuse
    filehandles for new files after the original file gets deleted, then
    "recovery" is impossible, since it may be that the filehandle now points
    to a different file. Note that this is broken server behaviour that may
    happen even without us ever seeing the ESTALE error.
    In order to minimize (but we can never eliminate entirely) this race
    condition on unfsd servers, Linux has traditionally made ESTALE a
    permanent condition on all filehandles except the root filehandle.
    
    The problem is that if we apply this strict staleness criterion to
    directories (particularly so for he current directory), then all
    processes will need to re-walk the path starting from the mount point,
    in order to recover from the sysadmin intervention case. As this is not
    usual on other *NIX implementations, and may in any case be undermined by
    caching rules etc, this is being seen as a usability problem.
    
    This patch makes ESTALE a non-permanent condition on directories, but
    preserves the current behaviour for non-directories.

    [ARM] Fix slab corruption issues triggered with pud_t integration.
    
    When the page tables are wrapped from 4 levels to 2 levels, the new
    MM code requires PMD_SHIFT to match PUD_SHIFT, which must also
    match PGDIR_SHIFT.  If PMD_SHIFT is smaller than PUD_SHIFT, we risk
    freeing a still-in-use table (== page) which can then get re-used
    for the slab cache.
    
    Testing and inspection shows that there isn't any real benefit from
    keeping PMD_SHIFT set to 20.
    
    In addition, add some comments concerning the granularity of
    alloc_init_section() and fix a missing PMD assignment in the
    rebooting code.  Somehow we managed to get away with that, although
    it is actually wrong.  Maybe I've just been lucky until now.

    [PATCH] track capabilities in default dummy security module code
    
    Switch dummy logic around to set cap_* bits during exec and set*uid based
    on basic uid check.  Then check cap_* bits during capable() (rather than
    doing basic uid check).  This ensures that capability bits are properly
    initialized in case the capability module is later loaded.

    Under any normal use it gets auto-selected by PS/2 mouse or ATKBD
    support anyway, and if those aren't selected there's no reason to
    select this one either unless you have some very special uses.

    [PATCH] s390: SCLP device driver cleanup
    
    From: Peter Oberparleiter <peter.oberparleiter@de.ibm.com>
    
    sclp: core driver cleanup
    
    Details:
    - moved signal shutdown (quiesce) handling into a separate file
    - cleanup of SCLP core driver:
      . introduced driver states instead of bits
      . introduced request retry count and retry limit
      . sclp_add_request now returns an error code if a request couldn't be started
      . introduced separate request structure for init_mask requests to simplify
        code
      . request timer is now manually checked in sclp_sync_wait because timer
        interrupts are disabled in this context
      . removed busy timer - request timer now handles both cases
      . split up sclp_start_request into __sclp_start_request and sclp_process
        queue
      . removed sclp_error_message (unused)
      . introduced sclp_check_handler function to split up initial init mask
        test from standard init mask request processing
      . introduced sclp_deactivate and sclp_reactivate for simplified reboot
        event handling (and potential use in suspend/resume scenario)
      . added protection against multiple concurrent init mask calls
    - minor changes in SCLP core driver:
      . updated comments
      . renamed functions to be consistent with "function name starts with __ =>
        needs lock"
      . renamed internal functions for consistency reasons
      . introduced inlined helper functions to simplify code
      . moved EXPORT_SYMBOL definitions next to function definition
    - changes in sclp console driver
      . removed callback recursion to prevent stack overflow
    - changes to CPI module
      . added check for sclp_add_request return code
      . changed printks to specify a message level
    - changes to generic sclp tty layer
      . removed timed buffer retry after error (timers may not work in some
        situations)
      . introduced return code for sclp_emit_buffer
    - changes to sclp tty driver
      . removed callback recursion
    - changes to sclp vt220 driver
      . removed callback recursion
      . removed timed buffer retry after error
    - modified sclp_init_mask to prevent problems with some compiler versions

    (advanced sysemu) in SKAS and TT modes.
    To have a fast selection of the appropriate ptrace option to use next,
    a 2 dimensional arry is used and singlestepping() is modified to return

        1 = singlestep a syscall
        2 = singlestep a "non syscall" instruction
    
    In do_syscall() writing of the syscall number is supressed, if the
    advanced sysemu is in use (that does it itself).

    [PATCH] uml: Fix setting of TIF_SIGPENDING
    
    From: Bodo Stroesser <bstroesser@fujitsu-siemens.com>
    
    My older patch, that sets TIF_SIGPENDING after an ptrace-interception
    in syscall_trace() is wrong.
    Some syscalls want to be called without any signal pending. If a signal
    is pending on syscall-entry, they immediately return with -ERESTARTNOINTR.
    Thus, on return to user, the pending signals can be processed and the
    kernel will lower eip by 2 to have the syscall restarted after that.
    Since my change sets TIF_SIGPENDING on the entry and exit interception,
    stracing such a syscall looped! Try "strace ls" to see what happens.
    Fix: set TIF_SIGPENDING on the exit interception only. This avoids the
    loop and is enough for security.

    [PATCH] uml: system call restart fixes
    
    From: Bodo Stroesser
    
    The implementation of sys_sigreturn() and sys_rt_sigreturn() in UML
    must be changed.
    This is necessary, since the return value of sys_*_sigreturn()
    is the value of eax in the thread, that was interrupted by the
    signal handler. If accidentaly eax contains -ERESTART_*, orig_eax
    *must* be -1 to avoid syscall restart processing in kern_do_signal().
    If orig_eax is >=0, eip might be lowered by 2, the process will fail.
    In UML PT_REGS_SYSCALL_NR() or UPT_SYSCALL_NR() have to be used
    instead of orig_eax.
    
    While writing and testing an exploit for this, I saw that for most
    interrupts, the syscall number is undefined. So even on a return from
    interrupt a wrong syscall restart handling could happen.
    
    And also: UML resumes a process with ptrace(PTRACE_SYSCALL/SYSEMU/SINGLESTEP
    when a syscall in UML in SKAS mode has been processed. But since there
    is a valid syscall number in the host's orig_eax, the host could do
    a wrong syscall restarting if the syscall in UML was a sigreturn() returning
    -ERESTART* To avoid this, in SKAS -1 should be written to regs.orig_eax
    before restore_registers().

    [PATCH] uml: kill host processes properly
    
    This patch changes how UML kills ptraced processes in order to be more
    correct in the presence of the ptrace changes in 2.6.9.  It used to be that
    ptrace stopped processes could simply be killed and they would go away.  Now,
    there's a new run state for ptraced processes which doesn't receive signals
    until they are PTRACE_KILLed or PTRACE_CONTinued.  So, this patch kills the
    process, as usual, then PTRACE_KILL and PTRACE_CONT.  This is done in
    os_kill_ptrace_process() for use from skas mode, and in tracer() when it
    sees a child process getting a SIGKILL.

    I'm not quite sure, that this patch doesn't cause problems with
    debugger usage. It should be testet by someone, who has more
    know how about TT-mode debugger.

    [PATCH] uml: make vsyscall page into process page tables
    
    From: Bodo Stroesser
    
    To make the vsyscall-page available for copy_from_user() and
    ptrace(), we should use kernel's "gate-vma" mechanism.
    Therefore we need a valid page structure. To have this, one
    page (or more) is allocated at boot time, the contents of the
    vsyscall-page is copied into this page and the page's pte is
    inserted in swapper's pagetables.
    Now it will be copied into the pagetables of all processes.
    
    Note: this alone doesn't work, since FIXADDR_USER_START and
          FIXADDR_USER_END are not yet defined correctly. Also
          access_ok_skas() does not yet grant read accesses to
          pages not in the normal user area.
    
    Risks:
    Please check the first hunk! I don't know, whether this change is OK.
    Maybe fixrange_init() is wrong anyway with 3-level-pagetables?
    
    Here access_ok_skas() and FIXADDR_USER_XXXX are fixed.
    Now everything should work fine, while the processes are
    running. But if a process crashes, the vsyscall-page will
    not be dumped.

    [PATCH] uml: add elf vsyscall support
    
    From: Bodo Stroesser
    
    This is the first patch of a series of four.
    These patches allow the use of sysenter-systemcalls in UML
    if the host support sysenter.
    Some facts have to be noted:
    - the sysenter instruction does not save anything, not even the
      return address. Thus the host-kernel builds a stackframe with an
      fixed return address for the backjump to the vsyscall-page. All
      kernels that support sysenter thus must have a vsyscall-page
    - The hosts vsyscall-page is visible in all memory-contexts on the
      host, even in those of the processes running on UML. This cannot
      be changed.
    So the best way to implement sysenter is to integrate the host's
    vsyscall-page into UML, if available.
    
    This patch creates a new source file containing an UML
    initialization function. The function scans the Elf-auxiliary vector
    that is prepared by the host for relevant information about:
    - vsyscall elf-header
    - vsyscall entry
    - machine type (called "platform", e.g. "i586" or "i686")
    - hardware capabilities
    These informations are inserted into the Elf-auxiliary-vector that is
    generated if an UML process calls "execXX()". If the information from
    the auxiliray-vector is not complete, UML uses the previos default
    values, with one exception: if the host has no vsyscall-page, UML now
    does no longer insert AT_SYSINFO or AT_SYSINFO_EHDR elements. (I think,
    that's better than writing dummies)
    
    Since the host's vsyscall-page is always visible to UML processes, this
    change is enough to let UML with an i686-compiled glibc use sysenter.
    
    what's missing:
    - is_syscall() in SKAS cannot access the code in the vsyscall-page via
      copy_from_user(), thus singlesteppers still could break out. (Note:
      that's not new, if someone jumps willingly to the sysenter-entry in
      the vsyscall-page, he can do that without the patch, too).
    - a debugger cannot access the code in the vsyscall-page via
      ptrace( PEEKTEXT, ...)
    
    Risks:
    could there by any feature of the host's processor, that is indicated in
    the hardware capabilities, but must not be used in UML?

    it was missing one
    
    os_close_file(fds[1])

    open is no problem).
    
    Also do some cosmethic cleanup:
    
    * "err" was what we returned even on success, so just use a neutral "ret".
    
    * use tabs, not spaces.

    [PATCH] uml: terminal cleanup
    
    This is a major cleanup of the uml terminal drivers and console handling
    (console as in "where the kernel messages go to", not as in "linux
    virtual terminals").  The changes in detail:
    
     (1) There is a new console driver calles "stderr" which (as the name
         implies) simply dumps all kernel messages to stderr.  That one
         is registered very early in the boot process via console_initcall()
         and will print every almost kernel message instantly: Both very
         early in the boot process and very late in shutdown.
         Note that this is not enabled by default, see below for details.
    
     (2) Ditched the early-console-init hackery in stdio_console.c
         (open_console(NULL) + related stuff) into the waste basket, not
         needed any more as you can use the new stderr console driver to
         get the kernel messages if your kernel crashes very early in the
         boot process.
    
     (3) Handle console initialitation for the uml stdio console and
         virtual serial lines the normal way using the console->setup()
         function.  Now all kernel messages appear on your console device
         once it is initialized without any dirty tricks.
    
     (4) The (2) changes allow a number of further cleanups:  As we don't
         open a line without a tty_struct any more we can ...
          * hook struct line into tty->driver_data
          * pass around tty_struct instead of struct line everythere
          * get rid of some trivial wrappers in ssl.c and stdio_console.c
            because we can get struct line via tty_struct all the time now.
    
     (5) Change the ordering in the arch/um/drivers/Makefile and thus
         the link and initialization order to make sure the stdio console
         and not the virtual serial line is the default console device.
    
     (6) Fixed a number of Documentation/CodingStyle issues within the
         code (not systematically, but usually just the places I was
         touching anyway or where it bugged me while browsing the code
         because it was hard to read).
    
    Looks like that cleanup also fixed some strange tty issues I've seen in
    the past (like console getty not responding to input sometimes, suse's
    /sbin/blogd causing trouble).
    
    Finally some usage notes for using the new stderr console:
    
    If the stderr console is enabled, then it is the default console device
    because it registeres very early in the boot process.  But as it isn't
    linked to a tty device this makes init unhappy, you'll see "can't open
    initial console" error messages.  Because you usually don't want that
    the stderr console is turned off by default.  That also maintains the
    behavior that /dev/tty0 is the first console device registered and thus
    the default console.
    
    There are basically two useful use cases for the stderr console:
    
     (1) Your kernel dies before the normal console device is initialized
         and thus you don't see any messages.  Just enable the stderr
         console to see them by adding "stderr=1" to the kernel command line.
    
     (2) You want to have the kernel messages on both stderr and your
         console terminal device.  Try something like this:
    
    	$ ./linux stderr=1 console=stderr console=ttyS0 ssl0=xterm
    
         This example sets up the console on a virtual serial line and
         pops up an xterm for that.

    [PATCH] hostfs: uml: add some other pagecache methods
    
    This is a follow-up to my previous "hostfs - uml: set .sendfile to
    generic_file_sendfile" patch. I was asking whether other methods should have
    been added, and comparing with ext3 I found some more ones.
    
    However, I have not specific clues about them: I know they use the pagecache,
    which relies on *page methods, which are defined by hostfs. So I think it
    could work.
    
    I have a doubt, whether hostfs needs the commented out method below:
    
    static struct address_space_operations hostfs_aops = {
    	.writepage 	= hostfs_writepage,
    	.readpage	= hostfs_readpage,
    /* 	.set_page_dirty = __set_page_dirty_nobuffers, */
    	.prepare_write	= hostfs_prepare_write,
    	.commit_write	= hostfs_commit_write
    };
    
    Hostfs does not have a underlying device (and I have some rough idea that
    buffers cache block devices data), so I wonder if that is needed or not.

    [PATCH] uml: unregister signal handlers at reboot
    
    From: Bodo Stroesser <bstroesser@fujitsu-siemens.com>
    
    In most cases reboot failed on my system.  After "Restarting system.", UML
    exited without further messages.  I found an SIGIO being processed by
    sig_handler() resp.  sig_handler_common_skas().  Don't know, why this exits,
    maybe the context is no longer valid at this time.  So, I changed the sequence
    in the reboot part of main() to stop the timers and disable the fds before
    unblocking the signals.  Since this wasn't enough, I also added
    set_handler(SIGXXX, SIG_IGN) calls to disable_timer() and
    deactivate_all_fds().  Now reboot works fine in SKAS and it still works in TT.

    [PATCH] uml: redo the signal delivery mechanism
    
    This patch rips out the old signal delivery mechanism and replaces it with a
    sane one.
    
    Specifically, UML used to capture a host signal frame and use it as a template
    for its own signal frames.  This was a worthy idea, because it promised a
    degree of architecture-independence for this part of UML, but impractical.
    There are some environments, notably 32 bit emulation on a 64 bit box, where
    you can't use the host signal frame as a template for your own.  Plus, this
    code is as complicated, even to someone who understands what it's doing, as
    the standard fill-in-a-structure-and-write-it-to-the-stack.  For everyone
    else, it is incomprehensible.
    
    So, this reimplements signal handling in the way that everyone else does.  It
    gives up on architecture independence, and moves this code into the
    x86-specific stuff.

    Remove uses of devfs_mk_symlink().
    
    We didn't do this before to avoid breaking most user setups, but this patch
    should be quite harmless.
    
    I've excluded the hottest part, i.e.  the ubd symlink, while removing the
    other; I released a end-user tree with this patch and there was a good number
    of people using the symlink rather than the preferred name.  That part will be
    merged later, I think.
    
    Since now we have evidence of less and less users using devfs, we think that
    it will not cause too much problems.

    [PATCH] m32r: Make kernel headers for mutual  exclusion
    
    Here is a patch to update kernel headers for mutual exclusion,
    atomic.h, bitops.h and semaphore.h of m32r.
    This patch is for making these headers publishable to userland.
    
    	* include/asm-m32r/assembler.h (M32R_LOCK, M32R_UNLOCK):
    	  Define M32R_LOCK and M32R_UNLOCK macros. For SMP configuration,
    	  these macros are expanded to m32r's LOCK and UNLOCK instructions.
    	  While, for UP configuration, these are simply expanded to m32r's
    	  LD(load) and ST(store) instructions, respectively.
    
    	* include/asm-m32r/atomic.h, include/asm-m32r/bitops.h,
    	  include/asm-m32r/semaphore.h:
    	  - Change macros from LOAD and STORE to M32R_LOCK and M32R_UNLOCK,
    	    respectively.  It is because LOAD and STORE are too generic words.
    	  - Change inline to __inline__.
    	    Retrieve __inline__ modifiers for functions which are placed
    	    outside of __KERNEL__ region in these headers, because those
    	    functions might be included and used from ISO C program in
    	    userland.
    
    Currently, it seems that these headers are allowed to be included from
    userland.  Indeed, they are kernel stuff, but these headers provide
    useful definitions and functions even for userland applications, I think.

    [PATCH] m32r: Update ptrace.c for multithread  debugging
    
    This patch updates ptrace.c to support multithread debugging.  So far, only
    one breakpoint's location was kept by kernel, however, in the multithreaded
    application's debug, it is required to kept multi-point breakpoint locations
    by kernel.
    
    In this implementation, maximum number of MAX_TRAPS(=10 (by default))
    breakpoint's information will be kept in the "debug_trap" member of the
    thread_struct for each thread.
    
    	* include/asm-m32r/processor.h:
    	  Modify debug_trap struct to keep multipoint breakpoint locations
    	  for multithread debugging.
    
    	* arch/m32r/kernel/ptrace.c:
    	- Update to support multithread debugging.
    	- Remove unused functions, withdraw_debug_trap_for_signal() and
    	  embed_debug_trap_for_signal().

    This patch updates include/asm-m32r/pgtable.h to add pgprot_noncached().
    It is required to fix a problem of an userspace application, which mmaps
    io registers.
    
    This patch also modifies drivers/video/fbmem.c to support noncachable
    framebuffer access for m32r.
    In this routine, pgprot_writecombine() is used hopefully, even though
    the current m32r never does write-combining or write-coalescing...
    
    Please apply this.
    
    	* include/asm-m32r/pgtable.h
    	  (pgprot_noncached, pgprot_writecombine): Newly added.

    [PATCH] typeof(dev->power.saved_state)
    
    arch/arm/common/sa1111.c: In function `sa1111_suspend':
    arch/arm/common/sa1111.c:816: warning: assignment from incompatible pointer type
    
    This is a rather annoying, and IMHO pointless warning.  First question:
    what is the reasoning for using an array of unsigned bytes here?  Are we
    expecting to power manage devices which only have byte wide registers?
    
    In reality, devices have half-word and word sized registers as well, which
    means that dev->power.saved_state actually points to device specific data
    (or even device driver specific data) for the device.  As such, it makes
    far more sense for this to be a 'void *'.
    
    I'd rather not go around the ARM kernel tree adding pointless casts to 'u8
    *' and back again because the wrong type for this was picked in the
    structure definition, so here's a patch which changes this to void *.

    sideways-port of the arm32 version, dropping the unwanted stuff and adjusted
    for arm26 compatability.

    Scheduler support for AMD CMP
    
    AMD dual core looks like HT but isn't really.  Hide it from the scheduler.
    This works around problems with the domain scheduler.  Also probably gives
    slightly better scheduling and disables SMT nice which is harmful on dual
    core.
    
    We still display it like HT in /proc/cpuinfo.  This is to make it appear the
    same to license managers so that they count dual cores only as a single
    physical CPU.

    [PATCH] x86_64: Add SRAT NUMA discovery to x86-64.
    
    Add SRAT NUMA discovery to x86-64.
    
    Previously the NUMA nodes on Opteron systems were directly read from the
    hardware registers of the northbridge.
    
    This version also supports reading it from the more generic ACPI SRAT table.
    This allows to support NUMA on all kinds of systems and in general gives more
    flexibility, but needs a bit of BIOS support.
    
    This implementation was not done before because the SRAT specification had a
    bad license from Microsoft that didn't allow to implement it on other OS.  Now
    that ACPI 3.0 is released and SRAT is part of it that isn't a concern anymore.
    
    One side effect of this is that holes not described in SRAT (e.g.  usually the
    640K DOS and 4GB PCI memory holes) will not included in the nodes and won't
    get mem_map entries allocated.  This may have side effects for some drivers.
    
    Some support for handling dual core AMD CPUs is included.
    
    SLIT parsing is done in a later patch.  Depends on earlier patches to split up
    the ACPI boot parsing and to add better CMP support on x86-64.
    
    Can be disabled with numa=noacpi

    [PATCH] x86_64: Split ACPI boot table parsing
    
    Split ACPI boot table parsing
    
    Split ACPI boot table parsing into two parts.  First a acpi_boot_table_init()
    call that initializes the basic ACPI table parsing machinery and discovers the
    RSDP, and then another call to actually parse the various boot tables.
    
    This is needed for a followon patch that implements SRAT support, because
    nodes need to be set up before the other ACPI tables can be parsed.
    
    On x86-64 I moved the early initialization very early because that is needed
    for the SRAT parser.
    
    On i386 it should be a nop.

    [PATCH] x86_64: Handle NX correctly in pageattr
    
    Handle NX correctly in pageattr
    
    Second attempt to try to fix an long standing NX bug in change_page_attr.
    Hopefully this version will be better.
    
    The kernel text mapping aliases part of the physical memory and needs its
    caching attributes changed too.  But when doing this one has to be very
    careful to handle the NX bit correctly.
    
    A previous slightly different version of this broke the X server on some RH
    systems.  I hope this version will be better, but if you have X server
    problems please revert this one.

    kernel.  Those heuristics are fragile in the presence of more than one
    bootloader (which isn't that uncommon in OS upgrade situations).

    [PATCH] x86: remove data-header and code overlap in boot/setup.S
    
    The setup.S data and code is not cleanly separated.  The current space
    reserved for setup header is not enough to fit the complete header.  As a
    result, part of the header (EDDBUF) will overwrite the initial code.
    
    I haven't seen any negative impact of this bug.  As, by the time the setup
    code is overwritten, we would have finished executing it anyway.  But, I
    think it is better to separate the header and code and prevent this
    data_overwriting_the_code condition.
    
    The atatched patch adds some space in the header to fit all the data listed
    in Documentation/i386/zero-page.txt for both i386 and x86_64 (and updates
    zero-page.txt).

    [PATCH] ppc64: tweaks to ppc64 cpu sysfs information
    
    Currently the ppc64 sysfs code registers an entry for each possible cpu in
    sysfs, rather than just online cpus.  That makes sense, since the sysfs
    entries are needed to control onlining of the cpus.  However, this is done
    even if CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU is not set, or if it is not a hotplug capable
    (DLPAR) machine, which is a bit misleading.  Secondly it also registers all
    the other sysfs entries (mostly performance monitoring controls) on all
    possible cpus, although they are quite meaningless on non-online cpus.
    
    This patch alters the code to only register sysfs directories at boot for
    cpus which are either online or could be onlined (cpu is possible, and
    CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU and an lpar machine).  Furthermore, the entries apart
    from 'online' itself and 'physical_id' are only registered for online CPUs
    (and deregistered again if a cpu goes offline).

    [PATCH] ppc64: kprobes implementation
    
    Kprobes (Kernel dynamic probes) is a lightweight mechanism for kernel
    modules to insert probes into a running kernel, without the need to modify
    the underlying source.  The probe handlers can then be coded to log
    relevent data at the probe point.  More information on kprobes can be found
    at:
    
    http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/linux/projects/kprobes/
    
    Jprobes (or jumper probes) is a small infrastructure to access function
    arguments.  It can be used by defining a small stub with the same template
    as the routine in kernel, within which the required parameters can be
    logged.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Resurrect Documentation/powerpc/cpu_features.txt
    
    Documentation/powerpc/cpu_features.txt mysteriously disappeared sometime
    when 2.5 forked off.
    
    Searching through BK logs on linux.bkbits.net didn't reveal anything,
    unfortunately.  The only reference I could pick up from searching the
    available lkml archives is the 2.4.20-pre11 ChangeLog where this was first
    merged.
    
    Thus far, nothing indicates it was intentionally removed, and AFAICS, is
    still up to date with the current code.

    [PATCH] PPC debug setcontext syscall implementation.
    
    Add a debugging interface for PowerPC that allows signal handlers (or any
    jump to a context, really) to perform debug functions.  It allows the a
    user program to turn on single-stepping, for instance, and the thread will
    get a trap after executing the next instruction.  It can also (on supported
    PPC processors) turn on branch tracing and get a trap after the next branch
    instruction is executed.  This is useful for in-application debugging.
    
    Note that you can enable single-stepping on x86 processors directly from
    signal handlers.  Newer x86 processors have the equivalent of a
    branch-trace bit in the IA32_DEBUGCTL MSR and could have similar function
    to this syscall.  Most other processors could benefit from a similar
    interface, except for ARM which is extraordinarily broken for debugging.
    
    Future uses of this could be adding the ability to set the hardware
    breakpoint registers from a signal handler.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Switch to KBUILD_DEFCONFIG
    
    The following patch switches ppc32 from using arch/ppc/defconfig to
    arch/ppc/configs/common_defconfig as a defconfig.  These files are supposed
    to be identical, but always end up out of sync.  This also updates the
    common_defconfig with current options.

    [PATCH] Fix broken RST handling in ip_conntrack
    
    Here's a patch that fixes a pretty serious bug introduced by a recent
    "bugfix".  The problem is that RST packets are ignored if they follow an
    ACK packet, this means that the timeout of the connection isn't decreased,
    so we get lots of old connections lingering around until the timeout
    expires, the default timeout for state ESTABLISHED is 5 days.
    
    This needs to go into -bk as soon as possible.  The bug is present in
    2.6.10 as well.

    addition of alloc_large_system_hash to the kernel.

    [PATCH] alloc_large_system_hash: NUMA interleaving
    
    NUMA systems running current Linux kernels suffer from substantial inequities
    in the amount of memory allocated from each NUMA node during boot.  In
    particular, several large hashes are allocated using alloc_bootmem, and as
    such are allocated contiguously from a single node each.
    
    This becomes a problem for certain workloads that are relatively common on
    big-iron HPC NUMA systems.  In particular, a number of MPI and OpenMP
    applications which require nearly all available processors in the system and
    nearly all the memory on each node run into difficulties.  Due to the uneven
    memory distribution onto a few nodes, any thread on those nodes will require a
    portion of its memory be allocated from remote nodes.  Any access to those
    memory locations will be slower than local accesses, and thereby slows down
    the effective computation rate for the affected CPUs/threads.  This problem is
    further amplified if the application is tightly synchronized between threads
    (as is often the case), as they entire job can run only at the speed of the
    slowest thread.
    
    Additionally since these hashes are usually accessed by all CPUS in the
    system, the NUMA network link on the node which hosts the hash experiences
    disproportionate traffic levels, thereby reducing the memory bandwidth
    available to that node's CPUs, and further penalizing performance of the
    threads executed thereupon.
    
    As such, it is desired to find a way to distribute these large hash
    allocations more evenly across NUMA nodes.  Fortunately current kernels do
    perform allocation interleaving for vmalloc() during boot, which provides a
    stepping stone to a solution.
    
    This series of patches enables (but does not require) the kernel to allocate
    several boot time hashes using vmalloc rather than alloc_bootmem, thereby
    causing the hashes to be interleaved amongst NUMA nodes.  In particular the
    dentry cache, inode cache, TCP ehash, and TCP bhash have been changed to be
    allocated in this manner.  Due to the limited vmalloc space on architectures
    such as i386, this behavior is turned on by default only for IA64 NUMA systems
    (though there is no reason other interested architectures could not enable it
    if desired).  Non-IA64 and non-NUMA systems continue to use the existing
    alloc_bootmem() allocation mechanism.  A boot line parameter "hashdist" can be
    set to override the default behavior.
    
    The following two sets of example output show the uneven distribution just
    after boot, using init=/bin/sh to eliminate as much non-kernel allocation as
    possible.

    While not perfectly even, we can see that there is a substantial improvement
    in the spread of memory allocated by the kernel during boot.  The remaining
    uneveness may be due in part to further boot time allocations that could be
    addressed in a similar manner, but some difference is due to the somewhat
    special nature of node 0 during boot.  However the uneveness has fallen to a
    much more acceptable level (at least to a level that SGI isn't concerned
    about).
    
    The astute reader will also notice that in this example, with this patch
    approximately 256 MB less memory was allocated during boot.  This is due to
    the size limits of a single vmalloc.  More specifically, this is because the
    automatically computed size of the TCP ehash exceeds the maximum size which a
    single vmalloc can accomodate.  However this is of little practical concern as
    the vmalloc size limit simply reduces one ridiculously large allocation
    (512MB) to a slightly less ridiculously large allocation (256MB).  In practice
    machines with large memory configurations are using the thash_entries setting
    to limit the size of the TCP ehash _much_ lower than either of the
    automatically computed values.  Illustrative of the exceedingly large nature
    of the automatically computed size, SGI currently recommends that customers
    boot with thash_entries=2097152, which works out to a 32MB allocation.  In any
    case, setting hashdist=0 will allow for allocations in excess of vmalloc
    limits, if so desired.
    
    Other than the vmalloc limit, great care was taken to ensure that the size of
    TCP hash allocations was not altered by this patch.  Due to slightly different
    computation techniques between the existing TCP code and
    alloc_large_system_hash (which is now utilized), some of the magic constants
    in the TCP hash allocation code were changed.  On all sizes of system (128MB
    through 64GB) that I had access to, the patched code preserves the previous
    hash size, as long as the vmalloc limit (256MB on IA64) is not encountered.
    
    There was concern that changing the TCP-related hashes to use vmalloc space
    may adversely impact network performance.  To this end the netperf set of
    benchmarks was run.  Some individual tests seemed to benefit slightly, some
    seemed to be harmed slightly, but in all cases the average difference with and
    without these patches was well within the variabilty I would see from run to
    run.
    
    The following is the overall netperf averages (30 10 second runs each) against
    an older kernel with these same patches.  These tests were run over loopback
    as GigE results were so inconsistent run to run both with and without these
    patches that they provided no meaningful comparison that I could discern.  I
    used the same kernel (IA64 generic) for each run, simply varying the new
    "hashdist" boot parameter to turn on or off the new allocation behavior.  In
    all cases the thash_entries value was manually specified as discussed
    previously to eliminate any variability that might result from that size
    difference.
    
    HP ZX1, hashdist=0
    ==================
    TCP_RR = 19389
    TCP_MAERTS = 6561
    TCP_STREAM = 6590
    TCP_CC = 9483
    TCP_CRR = 8633
    
    HP ZX1, hashdist=1
    ==================
    TCP_RR = 19411
    TCP_MAERTS = 6559
    TCP_STREAM = 6584
    TCP_CC = 9454
    TCP_CRR = 8626
    
    SGI Altix, hashdist=0
    =====================
    TCP_RR = 16871
    TCP_MAERTS = 3925
    TCP_STREAM = 4055
    TCP_CC = 8438
    TCP_CRR = 7750
    
    SGI Altix, hashdist=1
    =====================
    TCP_RR = 17040
    TCP_MAERTS = 3913
    TCP_STREAM = 4044
    TCP_CC = 8367
    TCP_CRR = 7538
    
    I believe the TCP_CC and TCP_CRR are the tests most sensitive to this
    particular change.  But again, I want to emphasize that even the differences
    you see above are _well_ within the variability I saw from run to run of any
    given test.
    
    In addition, Jose Santos at IBM has run specSFS, which has been particularly
    sensitive to TLB issues, against these patches and saw no performance
    degredation (differences down in the noise).
    
    
    
    This patch:
    
    Modifies alloc_large_system_hash to enable the use of vmalloc to alleviate
    boottime allocation imbalances on NUMA systems.
    
    Due to limited vmalloc space on some architectures (i.e.  x86), the use of
    vmalloc is enabled by default only on NUMA IA64 kernels.  There should be
    no problem enabling this change for any other interested NUMA architecture.

    [PATCH] collect page_states only from online cpus
    
    I noticed the function __read_page_state() curiously high in a q-tools
    profile of a write to a software raid0 device.  Seems this is because we're
    checking page_states for all possible cpus and we have NR_CPUS possible
    when CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=y.  The default config for ia64 is now NR_CPUS=512,
    so on a little 8-way box, this is a significant waste of time.  The patch
    below updates __read_page_state() and __get_page_state() to only count
    page_state info for online cpus.  To keep the stats consistent, the

    [PATCH] mark_page_accessed() for read()s on non-page boundaries
    
    When reading a (partial) page from disk using read(), the kernel only marks
    the page as "accessed" if the read started at a page boundary.  This means
    that files that are accessed randomly at non-page boundaries (usually
    database style files) will not be cached properly.
    
    The patch below uses the readahead state instead.  If a page is read(), it
    is marked as "accessed" if the previous read() was for a different page,
    whatever the offset in the page.
    
    Testing results:
    
    
    - Boot kernel with mem=128M
    
    - create a testfile of size 8 MB on a partition. Unmount/mount.
    
    - then generate about 10 MB/sec streaming writes
    
    	for i in `seq 1 1000`
    	do
    		dd if=/dev/zero of=junkfile.$i bs=1M count=10
    		sync
    		cat junkfile.$i > /dev/null
    		sleep 1
    	done
    
    - use an application that reads 128 bytes 64000 times from a
      random offset in the 64 MB testfile.
    
    1. Linux 2.6.10-rc3 vanilla, no streaming writes:
    
    # time ~/rr testfile
    Read 128 bytes 64000 times
    ~/rr testfile  0.03s user 0.22s system 5% cpu 4.456 total
    
    2. Linux 2.6.10-rc3 vanilla, streaming writes:
    
    # time ~/rr testfile
    Read 128 bytes 64000 times
    ~/rr testfile  0.03s user 0.16s system 2% cpu 7.667 total
    # time ~/rr testfile
    Read 128 bytes 64000 times
    ~/rr testfile  0.03s user 0.37s system 1% cpu 23.294 total
    # time ~/rr testfile
    Read 128 bytes 64000 times
    ~/rr testfile  0.02s user 0.99s system 1% cpu 1:11.52 total
    # time ~/rr testfile
    Read 128 bytes 64000 times
    ~/rr testfile  0.03s user 0.21s system 2% cpu 10.273 total
    
    3. Linux 2.6.10-rc3 with read-page-access.patch , streaming writes:
    
    # time ~/rr testfile
    Read 128 bytes 64000 times
    ~/rr testfile  0.02s user 0.21s system 3% cpu 7.634 total
    # time ~/rr testfile
    Read 128 bytes 64000 times
    ~/rr testfile  0.04s user 0.22s system 2% cpu 9.588 total
    # time ~/rr testfile
    Read 128 bytes 64000 times
    ~/rr testfile  0.02s user 0.12s system 24% cpu 0.563 total
    # time ~/rr testfile
    Read 128 bytes 64000 times
    ~/rr testfile  0.03s user 0.13s system 98% cpu 0.163 total
    
    As expected, with the read-page-access.patch, the kernel keeps the 8 MB
    testfile cached as expected, while without it, it doesn't.
    
    So this is useful for workloads where one smallish (wrt RAM) file is read
    randomly over and over again (like heavily used database indexes), while
    other I/O is going on.  Plain 2.6 caches those files poorly, if the app
    uses plain read().

    [PATCH] kill off highmem_start_page
    
    People love to do comparisons with highmem_start_page.  However, where
    CONFIG_HIGHMEM=y and there is no actual highmem, there's no real page at
    *highmem_start_page.
    
    That's usually not a problem, but CONFIG_NONLINEAR is a bit more strict and
    catches the bogus address tranlations.
    
    There are about a gillion different ways to find out of a 'struct page' is
    highmem or not.  Why not just check page_flags?  Just use PageHighMem()
    wherever there used to be a highmem_start_page comparison.  Then, kill off
    highmem_start_page.
    
    This removes more code than it adds, and gets rid of some nasty
    #ifdefs in .c files.

    [PATCH] mm: overcommit updates
    
    Alan made overcommit mode 2 and it doesnt work at all.  A process passing
    the limit often does so at a moment of stack extension, and is killed by a
    segfault, not better than being OOM-killed.
    
    Another problem is that close to the edge no other processes can be
    started, so that a sysadmin has problems logging in and investigating.
    
    Below a patch that does 3 things:
    
    (1) It reserves a reasonable amount of virtual stack space (amount
        randomly chosen, no guarantees given) when the process is started, so
        that the common utilities will not be killed by segfault on stack
        extension.
    
    (2) It reserves a reasonable amount of virtual memory for root, so that
        root can do things when the system is out-of-memory
    
    (3) It limits a single process to 97% of what is left, so that also an
        ordinary user is able to use getty, login, bash, ps, kill and similar
        things when one of her processes got out of control.
    
    Since the current overcommit mode 2 is not really useful, I did not give
    this a new number.
    
    The patch is just for playing, not to be applied by Linus.  But, Andrew, I
    hope that you would be willing to put this in -mm so that people can
    experiment.  Of course it only does something if one sets overcommit mode
    to 2.
    
    The past month I have pressured people asking for feedback, and now have
    about a dozen reports, mostly positive, one very positive.

    With Ram Pai <linuxram@us.ibm.com>
    
    - request size is now passed into page_cache_readahead.  This allows the
      removal of the size averaging code in the current readahead logic.
    
    - readahead rampup is now faster  (especially for larger request sizes)
    
    - No longer "slow read path".  Readahead is turn off at first random access,
      turned back on at first sequential access.
    
    - Code now handles thrashing, slowly reducing readahead window until
      thrashing stops, or min size reached.
    
    - Returned to old behavior where first access is assumed sequential only if
      at offset 0.
    
    - designed to handle larger (1M or above) window sizes efficiently

    thinking about other ways of protection but there would be always a window
    (provided I don't want to play much with namespace locks) where
    vfs_quota_on() could be called while umount() is in progress resulting in
    the "Busy inodes after unmount" messages...

    [PATCH] Fix of quota deadlock on pagelock: quota core
    
    The four patches in this series fix deadlocks with quotas of pagelock (the
    problem was lock inversion on PageLock and transaction start - quota code
    needed to first start a transaction and then write the data which subsequently
    needed acquisition of PageLock while the standard ordering - PageLock first
    and transaction start later - was used e.g.  by pdflush).  They implement a
    new way of quota access to disk: Every filesystem that would like to implement
    quotas now has to provide quota_read() and quota_write() functions.  These
    functions must obey quota lock ordering (in particular they should not take
    PageLock inside a transaction).
    
    The first patch implements the changes in the quota core, the other three
    patches implement needed functions in ext2, ext3 and reiserfs.  The patch for
    reiserfs also fixes several other lock inversion problems (similar as ext3
    had) and implements the journaled quota functionality (which comes almost for
    free after the locking fixes...).
    
    The quota core patch makes quota support in other filesystems (except XFS
    which implements everything on its own ;)) unfunctional (quotaon() will refuse
    to turn on quotas on them).  When the patches get reasonable wide testing and
    it will seem that no major changes will be needed I can make fixes also for
    the other filesystems (JFS, UDF, UFS).
    
    This patch:
    
    The patch implements the new way of quota io in the quota core.  Every
    filesystem wanting to support quotas has to provide functions quota_read()
    and quota_write() obeying quota locking rules.  As the writes and reads
    bypass the pagecache there is some ugly stuff ensuring that userspace can
    see all the data after quotaoff() (or Q_SYNC quotactl).  In future I plan
    to make quota files inaccessible from userspace (with the exception of
    quotacheck(8) which will take care about the cache flushing and such stuff
    itself) so that this synchronization stuff can be removed...
    
    The rewrite of the quota core. Quota uses the filesystem read() and write()
    functions no more to avoid possible deadlocks on PageLock. From now on every
    filesystem supporting quotas must provide functions quota_read() and
    quota_write() which obey the quota locking rules (e.g. they cannot acquire the
    PageLock).

    [ALSA] hwdep interface for pcm data
    
    USB,USB USX2Y
    Implements 'rawusb' pcm data transfer through hwdep interface:
    The usb_hc moves pcm data from/into memory via DMA.
    That memory is mmaped by jack's usx2y driver.
    Jack's usx2y driver is the first/last executable code to read/write pcm data.
    Read/write is a combination of power of 2 period shaping and float/int
    conversation.
    
    Compared to standard alsa/jack we leave out power of 2 period shaping
    inside snd-usb-usx2y which needs memcpy() and additional buffers.
    As a side effect possible unwanted pcm-data coruption resulting of
    standard alsa's snd-usb-usx2y period shaping scheme falls away.
    Result is sane jack operation at buffering schemes down to 128frames,
    2 periods.
    
    Also changed Kconfig file, so snd-usb-usx2y is only available for X86,
    PPC or ALPHA platforms, as on others DMA-memory isn't mmapable.

    [PATCH] aacraid: remove aac_handle_aif
    
    When aac_command_thread detects an adapter event (AifCmdDriverNotify or
    AifCmdEventNotify) it calls aac_handle_aif. This routine sets a flag,
    calls fib_adapter_complete, and returns. The bad news is that after the
    return, aac_command_thread continues to process the command and calls
    fib_adapter_complete again.
    
    Under some circumstances this causes the driver to take the device
    offline. In my case, it happens with a Dell CERC SATA with a RAID 5 in
    the "building" state:
    
    aacraid: Host adapter reset request. SCSI hang ?
    aacraid: Host adapter appears dead
    scsi: Device offlined - not ready after error recovery: host 0 channel 0
    id 0 lun 0
    SCSI error : <0 0 0 0> return code = 0x6000000
    end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 976537592
    
    Mark Salyzyn says the intent is for aac_handle_aif to perform some
    plug-n-play actions based on the adapter event, and return, leaving the
    command completion to the caller.
    
    The attached patch solves the problem by removing aac_handle_aif
    entirely, since it is wrong, and there is currently no code in the
    driver to actually do anything with these events.

    [PATCH] gdth buggy page mapping
    
    Just tripped over a bug report for the SUSE kernel where gdth would
    crash on a 32G opteron, turned out that the gdth_internal_copy() sg
    handling was really buggy. After fixing this I wanted to do the same for
    mainline, but I can see that a vain attempt was already made to fix it.
    Unfortunately it wasn't complete, and on top of that there's room for
    improvement.
    
    The current code is buggy on highmem, as page_address() will not yield a
    valid kernel address causing a NULL pointer dereference. The current
    code also doesn't unmap the sg list if it sees a NULL sl->page. In fact,
    the whole sg mapping looks really strange, why on earth would you be
    mapping the sglist for dma when you are only going to copy from it?
    
    This patch corrects both errors - correctly maps in the page, and kills
    the pci_map_sg/pci_unmap_sg calls completely. If someone could test
    this, that would be great.

    x86 ptrace: remove long stale (and bitrotted) test for
    PT_DTRACE without PT_PTRACED.
    
    Long ago, the "D" in PT_DTRACE meant "Delayed", and it was used
    as a flag to mark that we had ptrace'd the process but no longer
    did so. That hasn't been true in a while now, and the flag should
    probably be renamed, but in the meantime the test for PT_PTRACED
    being cleared had been corrupted into something totally nonsensical.
    
    Pointed out by Andi Kleen.

    acpi video device enumeration: fix incorrect device list allocation
    
    It didn't allocate space for the final terminating entry,
    which caused it to overwrite the next slab entry, which in turn
    sometimes ended up being a slab array cache pointer. End result:
    total slab cache corruption at a random time afterwards. Very
    nasty.

    [PATCH] ia64 PTRS_PER_PGD build fix
    
    mm/memory.c:1944:6: missing binary operator before token "long"
    
    The preprocessor doesn't like the typecast....
    
    PTRS_PER_PGD isn't used in assembly code, so this looks to be safe enough..
    
    This patch helps, but the ia64 build is still broken.  There is no
    implementation of __pmd_alloc().

    Add a temporary "fallback" header so architectures can run with the 4level
    patgetables patch without modification. All architectures should be

    as soon as possible, and the fallback header removed.
    
    Make all architectures include the fallback header, except i386, because that
    architecture has earlier been converted to use pgtable-nopmd.h under the 3
    level system, which is not compatible with the fallback header.

    [PATCH] convert Linux to 4-level page tables
    
    Extend the Linux MM to 4level page tables.
    
    This is the core patch for mm/*, fs/*, include/linux/*
    
    It breaks all architectures, which will be fixed in separate patches.
    
    The conversion is quite straight forward.  All the functions walking the page
    table hierarchy have been changed to deal with another level at the top.  The
    additional level is called pml4.
    
    mm/memory.c has changed a lot because it did most of the heavy lifting here.
    Most of the changes here are extensions of the previous code.

    [PATCH] replace clear_page_tables with clear_page_range
    
    Rename clear_page_tables to clear_page_range. clear_page_range takes byte
    ranges, and aggressively frees page table pages. Maybe useful to control
    page table memory consumption on 4-level architectures (and even 3 level
    ones).
    
    Possible downsides are:
    - flush_tlb_pgtables gets called more often (only a problem for sparc64
      AFAIKS).
    
    - the opportunistic "expand to fill PGDIR_SIZE hole" logic that ensures
      something actually gets done under the old system is still in place.
      This could sometimes make unmapping small regions more inefficient. There
      are some other solutions to look at if this is the case though.

    [PATCH] fix SPI transport class to do DV for broken Western Digital drives
    
    There's been a problem reported where a WD Ultra3 drive reports that it
    has an echo buffer of length 255 and then returns ILLEGAL REQUEST when
    anyone tries to use it.  This causes DV to treat this as a retraining
    error and eventually drop back to async.
    
    The attached fix makes the DV code identify the ILLEGAL REQUEST
    condition and configure the drive using the read only DV tests instead.

    [PATCH] Misc zalon fixes
    
    Some miscellaneous cleanups for the Zalon driver:
    
     - Remove unused definitions of sync_scsi_data_for_cpu and
       sync_scsi_data_for_device
     - Fill in dev->irq in the zalon driver
     - Request the interrupt in the name of the driver, not the bus address
     - Change the driver name to look better in sysfs
     - Call ncr53c8xx_exit() in zalon7xx_exit()

    According to the IXP Programmer's Reference Manual, a read from
    IRQ_STATUS can only return '1' for IRQ sources that have been
    explicitly enabled in IRQ_ENABLE. So if we never enable 'invalid'
    IRQ sources, we don't actually have to mask off IRQ_STATUS with
    IXP2000_VALID_IRQ_MASK.

    ide_setup_pci_controller() puts the device in a PCI enabled state.
    The patch adds a small helper to balance it when things go wrong.
    
    Actually the helper does not *exactly* balance the setup: if it can
    not do a better job, ide_setup_pci_controller() may only enable some
    BARS whereas the new counterpart will try to disable everything.

    [ide] propagation of error code in PCI IDE setup
    
    - Change the return value and the prototype of do_ide_setup_pci_device
      Due to lack of appropriate return status code, the current clients of
      do_ide_setup_pci_device() can not distinguish a failing invocation
      from a successfull one. The patch modify do_ide_setup_pci_device() so
      that it can propagate some of the errors from the lower layers.
    
    - Make ide_setup_pci_device() aware of the change and propagate the news
      itself. I only gave a quick sight to create_proc_ide_interfaces() (and
      ide_remove_proc_entries()) but they do seem sane and it should not matter
      if it fails or not.
    
    - ide_setup_pci_devices(): mostly the same thing than ide_setup_pci_device().
      do not look trivially suspect.

    [ARM PATCH] 2327/1: Thumb ld/st alignment fault fixups
    
    Patch from George G. Davis
    
    Adds support for Thumb ld/st alignment fault fixups via conversion of
    Thumb ld/st instruction forms into equivalent ARM instructions and
    reusing ARM alignment fault handler for Thumb instructions. This
    implementation was inspired by and initially based on the algorithm
    found in gdb/sim/arm/thumbemu.c.
    
    I've backed out the silly 'T' suffix on PC in this version as requested
    by RMK. At this point, I prefer to avoid making any of the other changes
    discussed, e.g. dump_instr() for bad instruction cases, in order to get
    the basic Thumb support change committed.

    Convert ARM proc files to use manifest constants defined in pgtable.h

    domain renumbering is required to implement support for ARMv6 MMU
    super sections where domain 0 is implied. Although this is technically
    only required for ARMv6, it seemed reasonable to clean up all proc

    that all proc file binaries are unchanged when this patch is applied.

    [PATCH] zatm fix
    
    Repairs the breakage introduced in gcc4 fixes.  Original had expanded
    to
    
    	((struct zatm_dev *)(dev)->dev_data) = zatm_dev;
    
    and that's what gcc4 had complained about (cast-as-lvalue).  Proper fix is,
    of course,
    
    	dev->dev_data = zatm_dev;
    
    What we have in 2.6.10 is
    
    	dev = (struct atm_dev *)zatm_dev;
    
    which doesn't cause complaints, but doesn't do anything good (leak + corruption
    at the very least).

    [CPUFREQ] speedstep-centrino: quieten driver (Venkatesh Pallipadi)
    
    Patch to remove speedstep-centrino error messages getting printed by default.
    Print them only when debug flags are enabled.
    
    The reason for this patch is -
    With the multiple drivers model that we have now, any installation will try
    different drivers one after the other, until one of them succeeds. So,
    failure to add speedstep-centrino alone doesn't mean error, as some other
    driver (say acpi.ko) can succeed later and system will still be able to use
    speedstep. Printing the error whenever speedstep-centrino fails can confuse
    the enduser.

    Current code will return frequency as 0 in such cases. Fix it by retrying the

    in worst case.

    [CPUFREQ] speedstep-centrino: fix SMP memory leak
    
    Venkatesh Pallipadi made me aware of a memory leak in speedstep-centrino:
    centrino_model is allocated for all CPUs. There were two possibilities: either
    make the centrino_model data per-CPU, or to share it across CPUs. I chose the
    former variant, as ACPI data may be broken and/or different for multiple CPUs.
    
    Additionally, I made centrino_cpu per-CPU, and removed a check whether setting
    allowed_cpus to policy->cpus resulted in smp_processor_id() == policy->cpu:
    if policy->cpus has more than one bit set, this check will fail very often.

    the scheduler disliking the "removing" task may cause the opposite.

    [CPUFREQ] acpi-cpufreq: force setting of P-State upon resume
    
    Upon resuming from sleep or swsusp, the ACPI P-States driver can't determine
    the current CPU frequency, as the ACPI specification doesn't contain a method
    to determine the current P-State.
    
    Therefore, _always_ re-set the CPU to the P-State it was before suspending,
    and don't abort early if this is the same state as the CPU was put to
    before (like it does make sense when using the ondemand governor, for example).

    [CPUFREQ] make ondemand governor aware of CPU domains
    
    The following patch makes ondemand governor aware of policy->cpus.
    
    policy->cpus mask lets multiple cpu use the same policy (useful where cpus
    share the frequency state), a recent change in cpufreq core.
    
    Now ondemand governor looks at all cpus in policy->cpus and takes its
    frequency increase/decrease decisions based on most lightly loaded cpu in
    the group. This patch will not affect systems where policy->cpus contain
    only one cpu.

    While it doesn't really make a difference in practice (MAX_DMA_ADDRESS

    there.  I found the bug only because I briefly experimented with

    [INFINIBAND]: Add IPoIB (IP-over-InfiniBand) driver
    
    Add a driver that implements the (IPoIB) IP-over-InfiniBand protocol.
    This is a network device driver of type ARPHRD_INFINIBAND (and
    addr_len INFINIBAND_ALEN bytes).
    
    The ARP/ND implementation for this driver is not completely
    straightforward, because InfiniBand requires an additional path lookup
    be performed (through an IB-specific mechanism) after a remote
    hardware address has been resolved.  We are very open to suggestions
    of a better way to handle this than the current implementation.
    
    Although IB has a special multicast group join mode intended to
    support IP multicast routing (non member join), no means to identify
    different multicast styles has yet been determined, so all joins by
    the driver are currently full member joins.  We are looking for
    guidance in how to solve this.
    
    The IPoIB protocol/encapsulation is described in the Internet-Drafts

    [INFINIBAND]: Add Mellanox HCA low-level driver
    
    Add a low-level driver for Mellanox MT23108 and MT25208 HCAs.  The
    MT25208 is only fully supported when in MT23108 compatibility mode;
    only the very beginnings of support for native MT25208 mode (required
    for HCAs without local memory) is present.
    
    (As a side note, I believe this driver would be the first in-tree
    consumer of the PCI MSI/MSI-X API)

    [INFINIBAND]: Add InfiniBand MAD (management datagram) support
    
    Add support for handling InfiniBand MADs (management datagrams),
    including sending and receiving MADs as well as passing MADs on to
    local agents.
    
    This is required for an SM (subnet manager) to discover and configure
    the host, since the SM's query MADs must be passed to the local SMA
    (subnet management agent).  In addition, this support is used by upper
    level protocols to send queries to and receive responses from the SM.

    [PATCH] 2.6.9 Use skb_padto() in drivers/net/8390.c
    
    The 8390 driver had been fixed for leaking information in short packets
    prior to skb_padto() existing.  This change gets rid of the scratch area on
    the stack and makes it use skb_padto().  Thanks to Mark Smith for bringing
    this to my attention.

    [ARM PATCH] 2264/1: Move platform-specific code out of entry-armv.S
    
    Patch from Deepak Saxena
    
    This patch borrows from the uclinux source where they have moved
    the per-platform code for get_irqnr_and_base, disable_fiq, and
    irq_prio_table out of entry-armv.S. However, instead of putting the
    macros in arch/arm/mach-$(MACHINE)/entry-header.S, we just have
    it in the machine's incdir. This means we don't need the extra
    complexity of creating symlink at build time. The patch also removes
    the irq_prio_table as a requirement for all machines and makes it
    specific to IOC/IOMD machines.
    
    This patch drastically shrinks entry-armv.S and allows us to delete
    and add machines without having to touch generic code (there were two
    dead machines laying around in entry-armv.S).
    
    Tested on IXP4xx and test-built for just about every defconfig.

    [libata] verify ATAPI DMA for a given request is OK
    
    After some testing, it seems that some PATA host adapter (ex. pdc20275) cannot
    work reliably with specific request buffer sizes under ATAPI DMA mode.
    
    Detailed test result:
    4096, 2048, 1024, 512, 256: OK
    384, 257, 255, 128, 96, 64, 32:  failed (irq lost)
    
    It seems multiple of 256 bytes are the safe ATAPI DMA buffer sizes to use.
    
    Attached please find the patch to fix the pdc2027x ATAPI DMA problem.
    
    Changes:
    1. Add a callback function "check_atapi_dma()" to ata_port_operations such that libata core
    can ask the driver: "Can this command be processed in ATAPI DMA mode safely? "
    when the the command is received.
    2. ATAPI DMA is off by default if the callback function is not provided by the driver
    
    If the callback function is not provided by the driver, the ATAPI DMA should be as is.
    The ATAPI DMA is already controlled by dev->flags.
    
    BTW, the patch isolates the ATAPI DMA workaround to the pdc20275 driver itself,
    not impacting libata core .

    [libata] PIO error handling improvement
    
    Tested burning CD-RW with libata-dev-2.6 and cdrecord:
    1. ATAPI DMA mode - tested OK
    2. ATAPI PIO mode - test failed when cdrecord finishes burning and issues MODE_SELECT to the device.
    
     After checking the log, it showed that MODE_SELECT caused ata_pio_complete() to return error.
    However, the error is not handled by ata_pio_task().
    
    Attached please find the patch for ata_pio_task() error handling for your review.
    (The patch is against the libata-dev-2.6 tree. )
    
    Changes in the patch:
    1. End the PIO task when PIO_ST_IDLE state is entered
    2. End the PIO task after PIO_ST_TMOUT and PIO_ST_ERR state handled by ata_pio_error()
    3. Remove the first "if" statement to handle the error condition returned from
       ata_pio_block(), ata_pio_complete() and ata_pio_poll().
    
    Change #2 is not so necessary since ata_pio_error() will put the cmd to  PIO_ST_IDLE state
    after the error condition is handled. The change just saves a function call to queue_work().
    
    Tested OK on on my machine with pdc20275 and ASUS CD-RW drive.

    [PATCH] drivers/acpi/ibm_acpi.o .init.text refers to .exit.text
    
    the ibm_acpi.c driver references acpi_ibm_exit() from it's __init function,
    which means the exit function isn't allowed to be __exit since __exit
    functions are not part of vmlinux while __init functions are.

    TUN/TAP driver packet queuing fixes and improvements
    
    Patch from Harald Roelle <harald.roelle@nm.ifi.lmu.de>
    
    Fixes for the following issues
    - "Kicking" packet behavior in case of kernel packet scheduler (! TUN_ONE_QUEUE):
      When the netif queue is stopped because of an overrun of the driver's queue,
      no new packets are delivered to the driver until a new packet arrives, not even
      when in the meantime there's again space in the driver's queue (gained by a
      reading user process). In short, whenever netif queue was stopped, one needs an
      additional packet to "kick" packet delivery to the driver.
      The reason for this is, that the netif queue is started but not woken up, i.e.
      the rest of the kernel is not signaled to resume packet delivery.
    
    - Adjustment of tx queue length by ifconfig has only effect when TUN_ONE_QUEUE
      is set.  Otherwise always constant TUN_READQ_SIZE queue length is used.
    
    - TX queue default length setting is not consistent:
      o TAP dev + TUN_ONE_QUEUE: 1000 (by ether_setup())
      o all other cases: 10
    
    - Default tx queue length is too short in many cases.
      IMHO it should be at least twice as long as the number of fragments needed
      for a maximum sized IP packet at a "typical" MTU size.
      This would ensure that at least one complete IP packet can be delivered
      to the attached user space process, even if the packet's fragments
      are "misaligned" in the buffer and the user process is not scheduled
      in time to read the queue.
    
    Additional modifications:
    
    - To signal that stopping of the queue has occurred, the tx fifo overrun
      counter is increased.
    
    - Implemented ethtool api. Primarily added to have a standard method requesting
      the driver version.

    SCSI: add queue_type entry in sysfs
    
    This adds an extra attribute to tell you what type of queueing the
    driver is using: none, simple or ordered.  If the driver supplies the
    change_queue_type API, you can also alter this (which would allow the
    turning on or off of TCQ).
    
    I also fixed the change_queue_depth not to allow the user to go below
    one.

    [PATCH] driver core: Fix up vesafb failure probing.
    
    bus.c file invokes a probe callback for most devices in a list, then checks
    for -ENODEV return ("no such device"), if so it remains silent. However, some
    drivers (including vesafb.c) may return -ENXIO ("no such device or address"),
    which is indeed error -6.
    
    I shut up the warning with the attached patch, that basically ignores
    both -ENODEV and -ENXIO.

    [PATCH] PCI: add legacy resources to sysfs for pci busses
    
    This patch adds legacy_io and legacy_mem files to the pci_bus class hierarchy
    in sysfs.  The files can be used (if the platform supports them) to access
    legacy I/O port space and legacy ISA memory space--useful for things like x86
    emulators or VGA card POSTing.  The interfaces are documented in
    Documentation/filesystems/sysfs-pci.txt.

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20041210 from Bob Moore
    
    ACPI 3.0 support is nearing completion in both the iASL
    compiler and the ACPI CA core subsystem.
    
    Fixed a problem in the ToDecimalString operator where the
    resulting string length was incorrectly calculated. The
    length is now calculated exactly, eliminating incorrect
    AE_STRING_LIMIT exceptions.
    
    Fixed a problem in the ToHexString operator to allow a
    maximum 200 character string to be produced.
    
    Fixed a problem in the internal string-to-buffer and
    buffer-to-buffer copy routine where the length of the
    resulting buffer was not truncated to the new size (if
    the target buffer already existed).

    This should reduce number of warnings in pci.c. It will still warn on

    something like "this is unique but arithmetic is still ok"), but that
    probably needs to be fixed in sparse.

    This patch adds an mmap method and some more error checking to struct

    wasn't sure about the return values for the case where an attribute is
    missing a given method, and it looks like mm.h can't be included in sysfs.h,
    so I had to forward declare struct vm_area_struct.  Other than that, it works

    This patch does some more cleaning up of the hub driver.  The idea is to
    use 1-based port numbers everywhere, in accordance with the usage of the
    USB spec, the values stored in USB messages, and the values printed in the
    system log.  The downside is that we have to subtract 1 to index the
    children[] array, but that's a lot better than all the additions of 1 that
    were there before.  To emphasize the nature of this change, I renamed the
    "port" local variable to "port1" every place it is used.

    [PATCH] USB: Hub driver cleanups [12/13]
    
    This patch does a little cleanup of the hub driver, nothing dramatic
    (although it is long because it touches a lot of code).  The main feature
    is that the private hub structure is passed as an argument to internal
    routines rather than the hub device structure.  This simplifies
    conversions, because it's easier to go from the private structure to the
    device structure than vice versa.  The other change is to store a pointer
    to the interface's embedded struct device rather than the interface
    itself.  This helps because that pointer is mainly used for dev_xxx log
    messages.

    [PATCH] USB: Hub driver: several bug fixes and simplifications [11/13]
    
    This patch adds several relatively minor bug fixes and code
    simplifications for the hub driver.
    
    	Perhaps most significantly, a test is added to usbfs to prevent
    	users from unbinding the hub driver from a hub with children.
    	That could cause some bad headaches, and it's best to avoid the
    	situation.
    
    	Don't set unused bits in the change_bits and event_bits fields
    	(this aids in debugging, nothing more).
    
    	Use the correct spinlock in the hub ioctl routine!
    
    	Add an argument to hub_port_disable, indicating whether the
    	device behind the disabled port should be marked NOTATTACHED.
    	Normally it should, but for retries during usb_reset_device
    	it should not.
    
    	Pass the child device as an argument to hub_port_suspend and
    	hub_port_resume rather than making them recalculate it.
    
    	Call usb_set_device_state in the suspend/resume code rather
    	than setting udev->state directly.
    
    	Set udev->power.power_state in the suspend/resume code so that
    	the correct values are visible in sysfs.
    
    	Recognize during hub_port_resume that the child device udev
    	might be NULL (this will happen when a new device is plugged
    	into a suspended port).
    
    	Don't allow hub_port_init to drop the usb_address0_sem lock
    	while a device on the bus is still using address 0!
    
    	Make khubd acquire a reference to the hub interface rather than
    	the hub device.  This simplifies disconnect/unbind testing.
    
    	Don't print a debugging message about hub events while not
    	holding some lock to protect the hub.
    
    	Remember to drop the reference acquired above if we fail to
    	lock the hub.

    [PATCH] USB: Hub driver: improve error checking and retries [10/13]
    
    Here's another "cleanup" type patch, most of which was written by David
    Brownell.  It causes the hub driver to retry a couple of different types
    of transfers if they timeout (which seems to help with some flakey
    devices), and it adds some error checking for the ep0 maxpacket value sent
    by the device.

    [PATCH] ipr: PCI-X capabilities setup fix
    
    From: Andrew Vasquez <andrew.vasquez@qlogic.com>
    
    While performing some PCI-X command register tuning with some of
    QLogic's cards, I stumbled upon some suspect code in ipr.c.  It appears
    the two functions ipr_save_pcix_cmd_reg() and ipr_set_pcix_cmd_reg() are
    actually reading/updating the PCI-X capabilities register and not in
    fact the PCI-X command register -- some code from
    ipr_save_pcix_cmd_reg():
    
    	...
            int pcix_cmd_reg = pci_find_capability(ioa_cfg->pdev, PCI_CAP_ID_PCIX);
    
            if (pcix_cmd_reg == 0) {
                    dev_err(&ioa_cfg->pdev->dev, "Failed to save PCI-X command register\n");
                    return -EIO;
            }
    
    pcix_cmd_reg points to the PCI-X capabilities register.  Yet, the read:
    
            if (pci_read_config_word(ioa_cfg->pdev, pcix_cmd_reg,
                                     &ioa_cfg->saved_pcix_cmd_reg) != PCIBIOS_SUCCESSFUL) {
                    dev_err(&ioa_cfg->pdev->dev, "Failed to save PCI-X command register\n");
                    return -EIO;
            }
    
    and subsequent update of the bits:
    
            ioa_cfg->saved_pcix_cmd_reg |= PCI_X_CMD_DPERR_E | PCI_X_CMD_ERO;
    
    should actually apply to the PCI-X Command register 2 bytes further into
    config space.  So, the following:
    
            if (pci_read_config_word(ioa_cfg->pdev, pcix_cmd_reg,
    
    should actually read as:
    
            if (pci_read_config_word(ioa_cfg->pdev, pcix_cmd_reg + PCI_X_CMD,
    
    The same is true for the 'save' case.
    
    Luckily, most devices hardwire the PCI-X capabilities register so the
    write is effectively a NOOP.

    Originally, the 53c700 driver implemented queue_depth changing as an
    attribute override, primarily as a demonstration of how it should be
    done.  Now that a large number of drivers wish to implement this
    functionality, it should become an API rather than an attribute
    override, since the latter are supposed to be used as one off extensions
    rather than the de-facto API.

    SCSI: Add FC transport host statistics
    
    From: 	James.Smart@Emulex.Com
    
    This patch updates the fc_transport with statistics for local FC ports
    (e.g. Hosts).  The statistics are defined per HBAAPI v2.0 definitions.
    
    Caveats:
    ------------
    - The information below is supplied by a simple test driver
    that does not
      talk to real hardware, but fully acts as a LLDD that supports the
      fc transport.
    
    
    This patch results in the following in /sys/class:

    [PATCH] PCI: Don't touch BARs of host bridges
    
     BARs of host bridges often have special meaning and AFAIK are best left
    to be setup by the firmware or system-specific startup code and kept
    intact by the generic resource handler.  For example a couple of host
    bridges used for MIPS processors interpret BARs as target-mode decoders
    for accessing host memory by PCI masters (which is quite reasonable).
    For them it's desirable to keep their decoded address range overlapping
    with the host RAM for simplicity if nothing else (I can imagine running
    out of address space with lots of memory and 32-bit PCI with no DAC
    support in the participating devices).
    
     This is already the case with the i386 and ppc platform-specific PCI
    resource allocators.  Please consider the following change for the generic
    allocator.  Currently we have a pile of hacks implemented for host bridges
    to be left untouched and I'd be pleased to remove them.

    [PATCH] USB: EHCI periodic schedule tree
    
    This implements an interrupt schedule tree for EHCI; the bug's listed
    in bugzilla (http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3374) and affects
    the ability to handle certain devices and configurations.
    
    Now multiple interrupt transfers are supported per microframe.  Scheduling
    prevents overcommit for reserved bandwidth and, for full/low speed devices,
    the relevant transaction translator's buffer.  (TT-per-port hubs are already
    initialized into the multi-TT mode.)
    
    The interrupt transfer schedule is arranged in a sparse tree, just like OHCI.
    A key difference is that OHCI implements a "best fit" scheduling policy,
    while this implements "first fit" for EHCI.  (There's no load balancing;
    it's not really needed in most users' configurations.)
    
    There's also logic here to handle "high bandwidth" transfers, guaranteed
    streaming of from 8-24 KB of data per millisecond.
    
    Also includes some related cleanups for descheduling interrupt transfers.
    Those will probably be split into a separate patch.
    
    Against 2.6.10-rc3-bk5 ... this hasn't recently been tested much, but the
    main old bug seems to be gone so it shouldn't make too much trouble.

    [PATCH] USB: EHCI "park" mode disabled
    
    This changes the default initialization of the EHCI "park" mode so
    that silicon which supports it (NF2, NF3, ALI, GeneSys, ...) will not
    use it unless explicitly told to do so by a (new) module parameter.
    
    This is a workaround for some problems observed on some NF2 systems:
    
        - Throughput ("hdparm -tT") is lower than expected with recent high
          performance drives (Maxtor) ... disabling "park" increases it by
          about 2 MByte/sec, but it's still much slower than expected.
          (USB analyser traces should be informative here.)
    
        - Some data corruption observed on reads from drives using an
          ALI storage adapter ... disabling "park" stops the corruption.
          (Strongly suggestive of hardware or peripheral firmware bugs;
          multiple back-to-back bulk-IN packets should work just fine.)
    
    The "don't use park mode" workaround will at most reduce USB (and PCI)
    throughput slightly on systems that work as expected, but some of those
    can re-enable the "park" mode.

    [PATCH] PCI Hotplug: drivers/pci/hotplug/ : simply use MODULE
    
    The patch below lets five files under drivers/pci/hotplug/ simply use
    MODULE to check whether they are compiled as part of a module.
    
    MODULE is the common idiom for checking whether a file is built as part
    of a module.
    
    In theory, my patch shouldn't have made any difference, but if you look
    closely, the previous #if's in cpcihp_generic.c and cpci_hotplug_pci.c
    weren't correct.

    [AGPGART] Fix TLB flushing issues with change_page_attr()
    
    Calls to change_page_attr() need an explicit call to
    global_flush_tlb() afterwards.  The AGP code didn't
    do this in a number of cases.  This patch makes
    map_page_into_agp/unmap_page_from_agp do the calls
    themselves, which takes care of most of the problem.
    
    The Intel AGP driver also has some slightly different calls to what
    map_page_into_agp() does, as it changes 4 contiguous pages.
    Introduce explicit flushes afterwards there too.
    
    Thanks to Alan Cox for pointing this out.

    This starts updating the usbcore interface to use endpoints in places it
    previously used pipes or other representations of the endpoint.
    
        - add new arrays of "struct usb_host_endpoint" pointers, matching
          current config and altsetting
    
        - get rid of the two epmaxpacket[] arrays; they duplicate information
          that's now readily accessible from the usb_host_endpoint.
    
        - resolve a FIXME by removing a function that only existed because
          the usb_host_endpoint wasn't readily accessible.
    
    It also removes most of an old rant about pipes, trimming it down so
    only the important bits remain.

    [PATCH] usb-serial: add tty_hangup on disconnect
    
    When a USB serial device is disconnected, user applications performing a
    read() now receive an error code, rather than waiting indefinitely. The
    included patch is originally from Al Borchers, massaged to apply to
    2.6.9 and 2.6.10-rc2. I've tested it on 2.6.9, but not on 2.6.10-rc2.

    [PATCH] I2C: i2c-algo-bit should support I2C_FUNC_I2C
    
    > Very few drivers seem to support the I2C_FUNC_I2C functionality, is
    > there a reason for that?
    
    Yes, most bus drivers are for SMBus, not I2C, masters. SMBus is a subset
    of I2C. These SMBus master are fully I2C-capable, although in most cases
    it doesn't matter. Most chip drivers are for SMBus clients as well.
    Almost all hardware monitoring chips are SMBus devices. So it's not
    surprising not to see I2C_FUNC_I2C widely used.
    
    > I have an I2C bus on my platform constructed from a couple of GPIO lines
    > using the i2c-algo-bit driver. The device on the bus is a DS1307 I2C RTC
    > and the driver for that currently checks for
    > 	I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_WORD_DATA | I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_WRITE_BYTE
    > however the datasheet suggests it is a simple i2c device with none of
    > this smbus stuff, Russell King queried this here
    > http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/developer/patches/viewpatch.php?id=2021/1
    
    First, note that all SMBus commands are valid I2C transfers. In fact,
    the SMBus specification doesn't do much except put names on specific I2C
    transfers, and sometimes give meanings to the data being transfered. As
    a result, "I2C" clients, although not specifically SMBus-compatible, may
    enjoy SMBus commands such as SMBUS_READ_BYTE, SMBUS_READ_BYTE_DATA and
    SMBUS_WRITE_BYTE_DATA. One typical example of that are EEPROMs and the
    eeprom driver. It relies on i2c_smbus_write_byte and i2c_smbus_read_byte
    (BTW I just noticed that it doesn't properly check for these
    functionalities... have to fix that) because it's so much easier to call
    these standard functions than rewrite I2C code manually. Also, this let
    us access the EEPROMs on SMBus (non-I2C) busses.
    
    Now, note that Russell is not quite correct in is assertion: "Do we
    really require SMBUS functionality, or is i2c functionality sufficient?"
    It's actually the other way around. SMBus puts restrictions on what a
    valid I2C transfer is. "Do we need the full I2C functionality or is the
    SMBus subset sufficient?" would make more sense.
    
    As for the exact functionality you need to check, let's just see how you
    access the bus. As far as I can see (providing that the code below
    Russell's comments is still valid), you rely on:
     * i2c_smbus_write_byte_data
     * i2c_smbus_read_byte_data
     * i2c_transfer
    
    So yo *need* to check for the availability of I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_BYTE_DATA
    on the adapter (which is part of I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_EMUL so any bus driver
    using that, including any relying on i2c-algo-bit, will work with your
    client driver) for the first two. And you also need to check for
    I2C_FUNC_I2C for the third one.
    
    Of course, any adapter with I2C_FUNC_I2C will be able to do SMBus byte
    data transfers, but since you do not use i2c_transfer to do them, you
    need to check the functionality separately (I think).
    
    Also, I think that what you do with i2c_transfer is similar to
    I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_READ_I2C_BLOCK, which is supported by some SMBus
    (non-I2C) masters. If you convert your code to use
    i2c_smbus_read_i2c_block_data, then you don't rely on the full I2C
    capatbilities of the bus, which means that your chip driver will be
    useable on more plateforms. That said, note that this feature is
    unimplemented on most SMBus master drivers as of now, and broken on a
    number of others (but I guess we would start paying more attention to
    them if there were more users for this function).
    
    > If I change it to a check for I2C_FUNC_I2C and change the algo-bit
    > driver to declare I2C_FUNC_I2C then the driver continues to work fine.
    
    You are right that i2c-algo-bit should declare itself I2C_FUNC_I2C
    capable. I even think that every bus being I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_EMUL capable
    is very likely to be I2C_FUNC_I2C capable. This means that other
    algorithms (ite, pcf, maybe pca) could most probably be declared
    I2C_FUNC_I2C capable as well. Can anyone confirm?
    
    > Given the above, is the following patch appropriate, or is there
    > something about the relationship between i2c and smbus that I don't
    > understand.
    
    I admit that the relationship between I2C and SMBus is somewhat tricky,
    it took me some time to get it and even then I am sometimes not sure to
    understand exactly what implies what ;) So we cannot blame you for not
    getting it at first. I hope I helped make things a little clearer. If
    not I welcome questions.
    
    Whether or not you change your code to use SMBus only in your driver to
    make it more widely useable, your patch to i2c-algo-bit is valid, I am
    signing it too and will apply it to the 2.4 version of the driver as
    well.

    Correct. I even think we should do the same for other chip drivers. For
    now they all use an arbitrary string. Using the driver's name would be
    both more consistent and more efficient (spares some bytes of memory).

    [PATCH] add class_device to miscdevice
    
    Currently misc_register() throws away the return from
    class_simple_device_add().  This makes it impossible to get to the
    class_device of the directories in /sys/class/misc and, for example,
    thus impossible to add attributes to those directories.
    
    Attached patch adds a class_device structure to the miscdevice structure
    and assigns to it the value returned from class_simple_device_add() in
    misc_register(), thus caching the value and allowing us to f.e. later
    call class_device_create_file().
    
    We need this for inotify, but I can see plenty of other misc. devices
    wanting this and consider it missing but required functionality.
    
    
    Add the class_device structure to miscdevice so that we can add sysfs
    attributes to /sys/class/misc/foo

    [IA64] Drop SALINFO_TIMER_DELAY from 5 minutes to 1 minute
    
    Experience with recoverable MCA events shows that a poll interval of 5
    minutes for new MCA/INIT records is a bit too long.  Drop the poll
    interval to one minute.

    [IA64] Clear all corrected records as they occur
    
    Because MCA events are not irq safe, they cannot be logged via
    salinfo_decode at the time that they occur.  Instead kernel salinfo.c
    runs a timer every few minutes to check for and to clear corrected MCA
    records.  If a second recoverable MCA occurs on the same cpu before
    salinfo_decode has cleared the first record then OS_MCA reads the
    record for the first MCA from SAL, which passes invalid data to the MCA
    recovery routines.
    
    This patch treats all corrected records the same way, by clearing the
    records from SAL as soon as they occur.  CMC and CPE records are
    cleared as they are read.  Recoverable MCA records are cleared at the
    time that we decide they can be corrected.  If salinfo_decode is not
    running or is backlogged then we lose some logging, but that has always
    been the case for corrected errors.

    [IA64] Add TIF_SIGDELAYED, delay a signal until it is safe
    
    Some of the work on recoverable MCA events has a requirement to send a
    signal to a user process.  But it is not safe to send signals from
    MCA/INIT/NMI/PMI, because the rest of the kernel is an unknown state.
    This patch adds set_sigdelayed() which is called from the problem
    contexts to set the delayed signal.  The delayed signal will be
    delivered from the right context on the next transition from kernel to
    user space.
    
    If TIF_SIGDELAYED is set when we run ia64_leave_kernel or
    ia64_leave_syscall then the delayed signal is delivered and cleared.
    All code for sigdelayed processing is on the slow paths.
    
    A recoverable MCA handler that wants to kill a user task just does
    
      set_sigdelayed(pid, signo, code, addr);

    [IA64] per cpu MCA/INIT save areas
    
      Linux currently has one MCA & INIT save area for saving
      stack and other data.  This patch creates per cpu MCA
      save areas, so that each cpu can save its own MCA stack
      data.  CPU register ar.k3 is used to hold a physical
      address pointer to the cpuinfo structure.  The cpuinfo
      structure has a physical address pointer to the MCA save
      area.  The MCA handler runs in physical mode and the
      physical address pointer avoids the problems associated
      with doing the virtual to physical translation.
    
      The per MCA save areas replace the global areas defined
      in arch/ia64/kernel/mca.c for MCA processor state dump,
      MCA stack, MCA stack frame, and MCA bspstore.
    
      The code to access those save areas is updated to use the
      per cpu save areas.
    
      No changes are made to the MCA flow, ie all the old locks
      are still in place.  The point of this patch is to establish
      the per cpu save areas.  Additional usage of the save areas,
      such as enabling concurrent INIT or MCA handling, will be
      the subject of other patches.

    [IA64] Cachealign jiffies_64 to prevent unexpected aliasing in the caches.
    
    On large systems, system overhead on cpu 0 is higher than on other
    cpus. On a completely idle 512p system, the average amount of system time
    on cpu 0 is 2.4%  and .15% on cpu 1-511.
    
    A second interesting data point is that if I run a busy-loop
    program on cpus 1-511, the system overhead on cpu 0 drops
    significantly.
    
    I moved the timekeeper to cpu 1. The excessive system time moved
    to cpu 1 and the system time on cpu 0 dropped to .2%.
    
    Further investigation showed that the problem was caused by false
    sharing of the cacheline containing jiffies_64. On the kernel that
    I was running, both jiffies_64 & pal_halt share the same cacheline.
    Idle cpus are frequently accessing pal_halt. Minor kernel
    changes (including some of the debugging code that I used to find the
    problem :-(  ) can cause variables to move & change the false sharing - the
    symptoms of the problem can change or disappear.

    This is a fix to help jfs work with grub.  A new IAG is created in

    mapping.  We should invalidate the former page to keep grub from

    since jfs will never access it again through that mapping.

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20041203 from Bob Moore and Alexey Starikovskiy
    
    The low-level field insertion/extraction code (exfldio)
    has been completely rewritten to eliminate unnecessary
    complexity, bugs, and boundary conditions.
    
    Fixed a problem in the ToInteger, ToBuffer, ToHexString,
    and ToDecimalString operators where the input operand could
    be inadvertently deleted if no conversion was necessary
    (e.g., if the input to ToInteger was an Integer object.)
    
    Fixed a problem with the ToDecimalString and ToHexString
    where an incorrect exception code was returned if the
    resulting string would be > 200 chars.  AE_STRING_LIMIT is
    now returned.
    
    Fixed a problem with the Concatenate operator where AE_OK
    was always returned, even if the operation failed.
    
    Fixed a problem in oswinxf (used by AcpiExec and iASL)
    to allow > 128 semaphores to be allocated.

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20041119 from Bob Moore
    
    Fixed a problem in acpi_ex_convert_to_integer
    where new integers were not truncated to 32 bits for
    32-bit ACPI tables. This routine converts buffers and
    strings to integers.
    
    Implemented support to store a value to an Index() on a
    String object.  This is an ACPI 2.0 feature that had not
    yet been implemented.
    
    Implemented new behavior for storing objects to individual
    package elements (via the Index() operator). The
    previous behavior was to invoke the implicit conversion
    rules if an object was already present at the index.
    The new behavior is to simply delete any existing object
    and directly store the new object. Although the ACPI
    specification seems unclear on this subject, other ACPI
    implementations behave in this manner.  (This is the root
    of the AE_BAD_HEX_CONSTANT issue.)
    
    Modified the RSDP memory scan mechanism to support the
    extended checksum for ACPI 2.0 (and above) RSDPs. Note
    that the search continues until a valid RSDP signature is
    found with a valid checksum.

    [PATCH] via-rhine: WOL band-aid
    
    After I disabled legacy WOL (i.e. controlled by EEPROM rather than
    driver) in 2.6.9, several people reported regressions. Legacy WOL had
    worked for them, but now it didn't anymore. The Right Way (TM) to fix
    this will get the driver to set up working WOL for all hardware, but a
    simpler solution will have to do for the time being: If a user requests
    magic packet WOL, the driver re-enables legacy WOL. Yeah, I know it's
    cheating.
    
    This version applies against -mm. I suggest to put it there for testing
    and into 2.6.11 if feedback is good.
    
    Thanks to Pavel Ruzicka for testing.

    [RTNETLINK]: Link attribute modification by interface name.
    
    This patch allows modification of link attributes by the interface name,
    avoids the requirement of translating a name to an ifindex first, and
    provides better atomicity to userspace.  It works by setting the ifindex
    to a negative number and provide the interface name via the IFLA_IFNAME
    TLV and let the kernel lookup the device by name instead of ifindex. Changing
    the interface name will not work using this method because IFLA_IFNAME also
    transports the new interface name.  The patch also fixes a possible source for
    bugs if IFNAMSIZ is ever changed to a number not aligned to RTA_ALIGNTO.

    [ALSA] fix display of send routing in /proc
    
    EMU10K1/EMU10K2 driver
    The emu10k1's send routing is a per channel setting.  The emu10k1 has 4
    sends per channel, the Audigy 8.  Currently we only display the first 4
    sends for the first channel.  This patch updates the /proc file to
    display the send routing for all 64 channels, and to display the last 4
    sends if present.

    In order to keep the RAM usage down with large devices and smaller
    erase block sizes, we were using blocks in JFFS2 larger than the

     - Free inode cache structure for a dead inode which is now completely gone.
     - Fix races vs. erase code which also walks the same lists.
     - Fix BUG() when trying to merge with a node which still belongs to an inode.

    MTD: Fix RedBoot FIS table detection.
    
    The redboot partitioning code currently searches for a FIS table entry
    named "RedBoot" (including the trailing \0) in one of the first three
    entries to try and verify that the sector it is looking at really is a
    FIS partition table.
    
    Firstly it fails when RedBoot is stored in some other Flash chip such as
    a boot PROM, in this case there is no "RedBoot" entry in the partition
    table. However there will always be a "FIS directory" entry in any valid
    FIS directory.
    
    Secondly it can fail since the RedBoot entry is not always in the first
    3 slots -- this can happen for example on an x86 based platform where
    the processor expects the boot device to be at the top of memory rather
    than the bottom and so RedBoot is at the end of the flash device.
    Equally when using "FIS directory" as the entry to search for it very
    likely is not in the first three since the directory is typically at the
    end of the flash.

    [ARCNET]: Fixes.
    
    As previously reported the ArcNet driver didn't work with Preempt and SMB
    on.  They do now.  I have changed the locking system from being a global
    arcnet lock to being a lock per device.  I used the lock in
    dev->hard_start_xmit = arcnet_send_packet.
    
    Furthermore I added the 'CAP mode' encapsulation.  As far as I see it it is
    the only encapsulation which actually makes ArcNet usefull over ethernet.
    Previously, the driver just ignored the hardware transmit status, now you
    can get hardware acknowledge and excessive nacks back to userspace via a
    raw socket.  The capmode.c is nearly just a copy of arc-rawmode.c.  The
    difference is that it inserts a ack_tx() handle into the general driver
    framework.

    If a directory entry refers to an inode which doesn't actually exist,
    we weren't marking it obsolete, so it was still visible in the file
    system, and would give EIO if you ever tried to stat it. Once upon
    a time, perl -e 'unlink' and rm -f would manage to unlink such things
    but nowadays they both try to stat it first and stupidly refuse to
    even attempt the unlink if the stat fails, and this is more of a
    problem. So we throw it away ourselves.

    Some architectures can optimize local_softirq_pending much better than

    Also this is the last use of softirq_pending() in common code, once this

    MTD: Provide XIP support for Intel flash chips.
    
    This allows for MTD support to be used on flash memory which is also used
    for XIP purposes, either XIP kernel or XIP userspace.  The whole idea is
    to relocate functions actually modifying the flash state away from array mode
    to ram and run them with interrupt disabled.  When the flash needs some time
    to complete a certain operation, we poll the processor for pending (but still
    masked) interrupts, and when they occur we suspend the flash operation in order
    to unmask interrupts and let the system run again.

    [PATCH] iSCSI transport class
    
    The attached patch adds an iSCSI transport class. It was
    built against scsi-misc-2.6. It allows the software/virtual
    iSCSI driver to remove at least one of its ioctl commands.
    The patch also assumes the no multipath/failover rule in
    llds applies to iSCSI drivers, so when we remove our
    portal/portal_group failover support it will allow us to
    kill all our ioctl commands execpt the session creation one
    (that will take more thought).
    
    We would like to build some functions like the
    unblock/block capabilites into the iscsi transport class
    like James Smart has done with FC class. but initially we
    would like to begin with this smaller patch that only provides
    an iscsi sysfs interface.

    This patch adds host/target/sdev destructor functions to the transport
    template. The FC transport is updated to utilize them to cancel any
    outstanding timer. It slightly rearranges the slave_xxx functions so
    the transport is always involved prior to the LLDD.

    update the fc_transport_class to use a workqueue instead of a timeout
    
    The amount of work that has to be done in the timeout routines is really
    a bit much if there's a large number of LUNS.  Plus the
    device_for_each_child needs user context to get the bus semaphore, so
    the solution is to migrate them from a timer to delayed work.
    
    There's still a race here in that the timer may still be ticking when
    the device is destroyed ... To fix this, I think we may need to
    introduce a destroy callback to the transport class.

    [PATCH] Another big 6pack patch
    
    Below another 6pack patch which I've got sitting in my repository for a
    while already.  The patch does:
    
     o Update my callsign
     o Cleanup the internal for synchronization with a 6pack TNC a little bit
       so it won't result in heaps and piles of messages in syslogs as it used
       to do.
     o Does paranoia checks for the maximum allowable packet size on transmit.
       There was a slight chance this might have resulted in a crash in just
       the right configuration.
     o Verifies the address family for the SIOCSIFHWADDR network interface
       ioctl.
     o Tries to do proper locking so nothing will access dev->dev_addr in
       midflight while changing the layer 2 address.
     o Uses an intermediate buffer for the SIOCSIFHWADDR ioctl so an error in
       copy_from_user can't result in a half-modified MAC address.
     o Swaps the arguments of decode_prio_command, decode_std_command and
       decode_data such that for consistency the struct sixpack pointer will be
       the first argument like everywhere else.

    [ALSA] removes unneeded spin_lock_irqsave()s from snd-es1968
    
    ES1968 driver
    spin_lock_irqsave(&chip->reg_lock) was called a second time in sequence from
    snd_es1968_bob_start() called from es1968_measure_clock().
    While this didn't cause harm on my UP laptop with mainline kernels,
    it made 'insmod snd-es1968' hang on kernel 2.6.9-mm1-RT-V0.6.9.
    The patch assumes that 2 callpaths don't need explicit spinlock protection:
    1: The trigger callback, because it is called with IRQs disabled.
    2. PM's suspend/resume callbacks, because  those are called while ortdinary
       user processes are frozen.
       Thus the spin_lock_irqsave(&chip->reg_lock)  calls in snd_es1968_bob_start()
       / snd_es1968_bob_stop() are not needed.

    This patch addresses the comments by Chris Leech about
    skb->mac.ethernet resulting in NULL dereference with the old method
    of implementing 2 buffer mode. The new method performs a copy of the
    MAC header to the head of the payload. This is a stop-gap measure till
    the fragmented skb receive feature in the kernel is made functional.
    
    Also, using GFP_KERNEL flag for buffer0, buffer1 memory allocation
    instead of GFP_ATOMIC.

    [PATCH] S2io: two buffer mode
    
    Attached is the patch for implementing 2-buffer mode on Rx path.
    
    On certain systems when a DMA has to happen on an un-aligned memory
    location performance will take a significant hit. It's standard
    practice to offset the Rx buffer address by 2 (as Mac header is 14
    bytes) so the IP header starts from an aligned location.  Obviously
    using a single Rx buffer both cannot be achieved. Thus XFrame supports
    something called 2 buffer Rx mode, where in the Rx'ed frame is split
    into 2 parts, one is the Ethernet header and the other is the Ethernet
    payload. So now we can allocate proper aligned memory for both buffers,
    hence the DMA is not slowed down. Also, the Ethernet payload(starting
    from L3 header) is on an aligned location so OS need not have to do
    un-aligned accesses to process IP header. To achieve this, the kernel
    function eth_type_trans functionality has to be partially implemented
    in the driver itself.

    1. When processing Rx packets, making sure that get offset of ring

    2. when NAPI is not in use a new spinlock(put_lock) is used to make
    sure accessing put offset of ring is atomic.
    
    3. Also introduced a new vaiable put_pos in nic_t to keep track of
    absolute position of the put pointer of Rx ring.
    
    4. When NAPI is used, fill_rx_buffer is not called from the interrupt
    handler(s2io_isr) .
    
    5. In s2io_poll, decrementing packets processed is done inside the
    while loop unlike out side it as was being done last time.

    The attached patch contains a modified scheme for allocating Tx descriptor
    blocks.
    More description follows.
    
    In the old scheme, the entire Tx descriptor space was allocated in
    one go. This could cause driver load to fail on systems with low(or
    scattered) memory. The Tx descriptor blocks are now allocated on
    per-page basis. A new structure (list_info) has been introduced in
    nic_t structure to keep track of the physical and virtual addresses
    of every TxD allocated this way.

    [PATCH] S2io: hardware fixes
    
    1. Xena3's with a set of subsystem IDs had Link LED problems, fixed
    that specifically for them.
    
    2. To write into the Keyed Mac_Cfg register to enable broadcast,
    writing two 32 bit writes into it along with a write to the key
    register rather than a single write to key and a 64 bit write to
    mac_cfg. This is necessary on 32 bit systems where a writeq(64 bit
    write) is actually two writel (32 bit writes).
    
    3. Writes to some special registers mentioned in UG is being done by
    a special macro which defines which 32 bits of the 64 bit register
    is to be written first. Again this applies only on 32 bit systems.
    
    4. Configured pause frame related water marks and a shared_split
    value which describes the Max TXDMA related split transaction that
    can be used without giving room for the Rx transactions.
    
    5. The mac_rmac_err_reg R1 register will be cleared in  the interrupt
    handler itself rather than in the scheduled task as was being done
    previously.
    
    6. Even on PCC_FB_ECC error the card will be reset by disabling
    adapter enable bit.

    2. In wait_for_cmd_complete there is no longer a writeq but just a
    read and wait for strobe bit to reset.
    
    3. In s2io_isr, the isr_lock has been done away with also the NICs
    interrupt are no longer disabled explicitly on entering the interrupt
    handler and re-enabled again before leaving it.
    
    4. Also clearing the semaphore "tasklet_status" when exiting
    erroneously from s2io_isr after failing fill_rx_buffer call.
    
    5. The set/reset Tx Csum function through ethtool was added to the
    ethtool_ops structure.
    
    6. Added a Rx side error code in the rx_osm_handler function.
    
    7. No longer stopping and waking Tx queue when link state changes in
    s2io_link function.
    
    8. removed the isr_lock spinlock from the s2io_nic structure.
    
    9. changed parameters which determine thresholds(LOW and PANIC)
    to replenish Rx buffers.
       This has been found to result in better performance.

    [PATCH] S2io: sw bug fixes
    
    1. In free_rx_buffers clearing out RxDs not owned by Xena.
    
    2. In alarm_intr_handler, when a serr error occurs, schedule a task
    to reset the card rather than stopping Tx queue.
    
    3. In s2io_close freeing IRQ before calling s2io_reset also added a
    new call to flush queued tasks. This is not done if the s2io_close
    itself is called from a queued task like s2io_restart_nic.
    
    4. read_eeprom function has been changed such that data to be returned
    is sent as an input argument and the return value represents a
    pass/fail. The previous implementation as Randy had pointed out was
    error prone as on failure it returned -1 which can be interpreted
    as all ff's, so any data area which contained ff's in the eeprom was
    likely to be treated as an error.
    
    5. Added a flag "task_flag" to track if the call to s2io_close is
    coming from the s2io_restart_nic function or from the ifconfig <I/F>
    down called by user.
    
    6. Moved register_netdev call from just after setting entry points
    to the end of the s2io_init_nic function.
    
    7. In s2io.h field added a new member into the s2io_nic structure
    called "task_flag".

    Version: 0.8.6
    Work on this started, when rumors spread that OHCI equipped machines would
    crash. This was due to me missing two facts:
    1) Ohci has a bigger usb frame number wrap around.
    2) It only supports URB_ISO_ASAP when submitting iso urbs.

    Further add a whitelist for cards where audio is known to work
    (many other cards do not implement the audio connection).

    [ACPI] create ACPI hotplug eject interface
    
    The kernel when it receives an hardware sci eject request it simply passes this
    to user mode agent and the agent in turn will offline all the child devices and
    then echo's 1 onto the eject file for that acpi device.
    
    This patch provides the sysfs "eject" interface for the user mode agent
    to notify the core acpi so that the core acpi can trim its bus which
    causes .remove function to be called for all child devices.
    
    For example for LSB0 which is an ejectable device, we will see
    /sys/firmware/acpi/namespace/ACPI/_SB/LSB/eject.

           unloaded at any time.

    Automatic adjustement of highmem dma feature.
    
    The first interruption encountered on systems where the 8169 does not
    perform PCI DAC correctly seems to always be a PCI error one.
    When DAC is enabled, the driver tries to issue a complete down/up
    sequence as an addition to the usual halt of the device.

    Tx timeout rework:
    - the ring descriptors of the chipset and the ring index of the driver
      are synced during a reset of the device;
    - rtl8169_interrupt: rtl8169_hw_reset() replaces the previous stop code.
      An implicit reset of the device is added but it makes no noticeable
      difference with the former behavior (i.e.: stop the chipset).

           on protocol numbering scheme. Make protocol detection routines
           return -1 on failure to keep them consistent with ther rest
           of the code. Set mouse parameters right in detection routines
           instead of doing it in psmouse_extensions.

    Sure. Patch is for 2.6 (not rediffed, yell if it doesn't apply
    anymore). Btw, did you pick up the mc_filter patch for 2.4 via-rhine?

    Default to disabling PCI DAC as this option appears unsafe on amd64
    (original suggestion by Hans-Frieder Vogt <hfvogt@arcor.de>).
    
    The driver will typically report PCI System error when something goes
    wrong. The relevant interrupt is not masked any more and the driver
    can thus be disabled.

    [PATCH] r8169: code cleanup
    
    Cleanup/code removal:
    - MAX_ETH_FRAME_SIZE is not used;
    - removal of assertion for impossible condition (if it happens, it will _not_
      take long to notice anyway)
    - introduce rtl8169_release_board() to factor out some code;
    - rtl8169_init_board:
      - some variables are not really needed nor do they help read the code;
      - more explicit name for label;
    - tp->{Rx/Tx}DescArray: no need to zeroize coherent DMA mapping.

    [PATCH] r8169: add ethtool_ops.{get_regs_len/get_regs}
    
    - ethtool_ops.{get_regs_len/get_regs} for r8169;
    - fix a dubious check: datasheet v1.21 claims on p.44 that io/memory space
      is exactly 256 bytes wide;
    - use SET_ETHTOOL_OPS().
