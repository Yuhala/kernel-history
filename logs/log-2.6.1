    Fix subtle fork() race that Ingo noticed.
    
    We must not mark the process TASK_STOPPED early, because
    that might allow a signal to wake it up before we actually
    got to the "wake_up_forked_process()" state. Total confusion
    would happen.
    
    Make wake_up_forked_process() verify the new world order.

    from __bss_start to _end. Add __bss_stop to our section definitions so
    we can use it instead.

    JFS currently clears i_sb in some error pathes which can make the
    core kernel OOPS because it may never be NULL.  Noticed because some
    IBM people try to "fix" the core kernel for it now..

    [PATCH] ia32 sched_clock() deadlock fix
    
    From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>,
    
    Voyager is getting odd deadlocks due to the taking of xtime_lock() in
    sched_clock()->get_jiffies_64().
    
    I had this patch queued up to fix a different deadlock, which occurs when we
    relax the requirement that TSC's be synchronised across CPUs.  But it will
    fix James' deadlock too.

    [PATCH] JFS fix for NFS on little-endian systems
    
    From: Dave Kleikamp <shaggy@austin.ibm.com>
    
    After Jose debugged the problem down to the routine jfs_get_parent, we
    were able to find the problem.  I believe it only affects users of
    NFS-exported JFS file systems on big-endian hardware.
    
    The problem was a missing le32_to_cpu macro.  The patch also fixes a
    return code to be more consistent other implementations of get_parent.

    [PATCH] fix oopses on rmmod in some OSS drivers
    
    Fix for oops on rmmod caused by *_remove() function marked as __devinit
    (and thus discarded after module initialization - if CONFIG_MODULES=y
    and CONFIG_HOTPLUG is not set).
    This patch changes __devinit to __devexit and adds __devexit_p() where
    pointer to such function is used.
    
    The only exception is au1000, where au1000_remove() is called from
    cleanup_au1000() function - __devinit is jest removed there.

    [NET]: Fix multiple eth0 mixed PCI/ISA init.
    
    This patch for 2.6 fixes the problem found by Zoltan Farkas
    with mixed PCI/ISA and a non-modular config.  The problem is the old_netdev
    ISA probing isn't skipping eth0 which already got assigned by the PCI
    initialization.

    [SERIAL] EISA ID for PnP modem
    
    Patch from: Amit Gurdasani
    
    I have a PROLiNK 1456VH internal Rockwell-based ISA PnP K56flex fax modem
    whose EISA ID seems not to be known to 8250_pnp.c. The ID is AEI0250 as
    reported in /sys/devices/pnp1/01:01/01:01.00/id and adding this into the
    pnp_dev_table[] allows the device to be found and enabled properly by the
    8250 serial driver.

    Fix IDE "PIO WRITE wait for ready" test under extreme interrupt load.
    
    From Daniel Tram Lux: under extreme irq load on an underpowered CPU,
    the timeout loop may not make any progress, and decide that a timeout
    occurred before it has actually tested the status register.
    
    The minimal fix for now is to just have a final test _after_ the timeout
    to remove the problem. The real fix would likely be to not have irqs
    enabled between reading the status and the timeout.

    ia64: Fix a ptrace-bug that caused "strace -f" to crash the inferior
          process.  The root-cause of the problem was that ptrace() tried
          to copy the portion of the register backing store that landed on
          the kernel stack back to users-space, but the resulting state
          was inconsistent if the inferior process was in the middle of a
          system-call (as would always be the case for strace).
    
          The solution is to avoid all needless copying and to instead
          ensure that when accessing a memory location that may belong to
          a thread's register-backing store, we attach to that particular
          thread, rather than the thread identified by the PID argument.
          If the thread happens to be unattachable, we fall back to using
          the thread identified by the PID argument.  This should have the
          desired effect if the thread has terminated already and if the
          thread is running while ptrace() is trying to access its state,
          all bets are off anyhow and there are no coherency guarantees.
          In other words, this should be doing the right thing under all
          circumstances.
    
          The patch also fixes the case where PT_AR_BSP and/or PT_CFM are
          written while the inferior process is in the middle of a system
          call.  This makes arguments passed to GDB inferior calls come
          out right.
    
          The patch was tested with strace -f and the GDB testsuite, which
          showed no regressions compared to the previous version of the
          kernel.

    [PATCH] call_usermodehelper retval fix
    
    The reworked firmware loader in the DVB patches needs the fix to the
    call_usermodehelper() return value.
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    MODULE_ALIAS_BLOCK() and MODULE_ALIAS_CHAR() define aliases of form
    "XXX-<major>-<minor>", so we should probe for modules using this form.
    Unfortunately in 2.4, block aliases were "XXX-<major>" and char aliases
    were of both forms.
    
    Ideally, all modules would now be using MODULE_ALIAS() macros to define
    their aliases, and the old configuration files wouldn't matter as much.
    Unfortunately, this hasn't happened, so we make request_module() return the
    exit status of modprobe, and then do fallback when probing for char and
    block devices.
    
    (Kudos to Chris Wright, I stole his kernel_thread flags).

    - There is a very odd problem with the alignment of dword_t values

      Solaris 8.  The workaround is not use a pointer and to memcpy the
      values instead.

    [PATCH] readahead: multiple performance fixes
    
    From: Ram Pai <linuxram@us.ibm.com>
    
    I have enclosed a patch that fixes a bunch of performance bugs in the
    readahead code.
    
    Below is a brief summary of the problems noticed and the proposed fixes
    with some results:
    
     Problem 1:  Readahead code closes the readahead window and goes into
     slowread path, if a file is accessed the first time at an offset
     notequal to zero.  In the case of databases(especially in db2), a file
     may not be accessed at offset 0 the first time though the i/o's are
     sequential.
    
     Fix to Problem 1:
              min = get_min_readahead(ra);
             orig_next_size = ra-next_size;
    
     -       if (ra-next_size == 0 && offset == 0) {
     +       if (ra-next_size == 0) {
    
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Problem 2: After fixing Problem, the readahead window still does not
     open up the first time, if all the pages requested are already in the
     page cache. This time the window closes because of pagecache hits
     instead of misses. To fix this we put in these changes.
    
     -               check_ra_success(ra, ra-size, actual, orig_next_size);
     +               if(!first_access) {
     +                       check_ra_success(ra, ra-size, actual, orig_next_size);
     +               }
    
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Problem 3: In the case of large random reads, the readahead window is
     read in, the moment there is a hit in the active window. And it turns
     out that in most of the cases the readahead window gets scrapped,
     because the next large random read does not even touch any of the pages
     in that readahead window. We fixed this by introducing lazy readahead.
     Basically we wait till the last page in the active window gets a hit.
     And once the last page is hit, the readahead window is then read in.
     This fix gave a tremendous boost in the performance.
     To fix this the changes we put in were:
    
                     /*
                      * This read request is within the current window.  It is time
                      * to submit I/O for the ahead window while the application is
                      * crunching through the current window.
                      */
     -               if (ra-ahead_start == 0) {
     +               if (ra-ahead_start == 0 && offset == (ra-start + ra-size -1)) {
    
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Problem 4:
           If the request page does not fall in the active window and is not
    the  first page of the read ahead window, we scrap both the active
    window and the readahaed window and read in the active window. But it
    turns out that we read in a lot of pages in the active window based on
    the size of the 'projected readahead window size' (the next_size
    variable). And we end up using part of the active window and waste the
    remaining. We put  in a fix where we read in just as many pages in the
    active window based on the number of pages used in the recent past.
     Again this gave us another big boost in performance and ended up
    beating the performance of aio patch on a DSS workload.
    
     The fix to this is:
                      * ahead window and get some I/O underway for the new
                      * current window.
                      */
     +               if (!first_access && preoffset = ra-start &&
     +                               preoffset < (ra-start + ra-size)) {
     +                       ra-size = preoffset - ra-start + 2;
     +               } else {
     +                       ra-size = ra-next_size;
    
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Problem 5:
     With all the above fixes there is very low chance that the readahead
     window shall close.  But however if it does, we found that the slow
     read  path is really slow.  Any loss of sequentiality in the slow read
     path is penalized heavily by closing the window back to zero. So we
     fixed this  by decreasing the window size by one anytime we loose
     sequentiality and  increasing in by 1 if we didn't.
    
                     if (offset != ra-prev_page + 1) {
     -                       ra-size = 0;            /* Not sequential */
     +                       ra-size = ra-size?ra-size-1:0; /*Notsequential */
    
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    With the above set of fixes we got about 28% improvement in DSS workload
    which is about 5% more than what we got with the suparna's aio patch.
    
    This patch compared equivalent to suparna's aio patch with aio-stress
    run.
    
    It fared better than aio patch for large random io.
    
    We are yet to run a bunch of other benchmarks to evaluate this patch.
    We would like to get your inputs on this patch and any suggestions you
    may have to improve it. I have enclosed a patch with all these changes
    along with some changes to the comments that reflect the new behaviour.
    NOTE: the above patch reverts suparna's aio patch.

    [PATCH] Fix 2.6.0's broken documentation references
    
    From: Hans Ulrich Niedermann <linux-kernel@n-dimensional.de>
    
    I've noted that 2.6.0 contains broken references to documentation.
    
    I got sufficiently annoyed chasing doc files in the wrong place
    that I wrote a script to check the references to documentation
    files.
    
    Some documentation files have moved (e.g.  Documentation/modules.txt to
    Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt).  I adapted the references with a script.

    [PATCH] shrink_slab acounts for seeks incorrectly
    
    wli points out that shrink_slab inverts the sense of shrinker->seeks: those
    caches which require more seeks to reestablish an object are shrunk harder.
    That's wrong - they should be shrunk less.
    
    So fix that up, but scaling the result so that the patch is actually a no-op
    at this time, because all caches use DEFAULT_SEEKS (2).

    [PATCH] fix pci_update_resource() / IORESOURCE_UNSET on PPC
    
    From: Harald Welte <laforge@gnumonks.org>
    
    [disclaimer:  This was posted on the linuxppc list before, BenH asked me=20
     to re-post it to lkml]
    
    The prism54 (http://prism54.org) driver for my cardbus adapter works
    with 2.4.x, but not 2.6.x on a Titanium G4 Powerbook IV.
    
    On 2.6.x the error message was
    PCI:0001:02:00.0 Resource 0 [00000000-00001fff] is unassigned
    
    After investigating differences in the PCI code of 2.4.x and 2.6.x, i
    noticed that 2.4.x/arc/ppc/kernel/pci.c:pcibios_update_resource()
    contained a couple of lines that unset the IORESOURCE_UNSET bitflag.
    
    In 2.6.x, this is handled by the generic PCI core in
    drivers/pci/setup-res.c:pci_update_resource() code.  However, the code
    is missing the 'res->flags &=3D ~IORESOURCE_UNSET' part.
    
    The below fix re-adds that section from 2.4.x.=20
    
    I'm not sure wether this belongs into the arch-independent PCI api.
    Anyway, on PPC it seems to be needed for certain cardbus devices.
    
    Any comments welcome.

    [PATCH] (workaround): avoid raid1 crash during resync with qlogic controllers
    
    qlogic's 16k maximum I/O size bites again.  Neil says:
    
     The problems we fixed were all to do with normal IO.  This one is resync
     IO.
    
     The problem here is that raid1 always does resync in RESYNC_BLOCK_SIZE
     (=64k) IOs and if the device doesn't cope - tough.
    
     The simple fix is to #define RESYNC_BLOCK_SIZE to PAGE_SIZE in md/raid1.c
    
     The better fix is to rewrite the raid1 resync code to use bio_add_page.
    
     This means we have to build the read request and the write requests at the
     same time, and then when a bio_add_page fails, we back-out the last page
     from the bios that have one too many, and then do the read followed by the
     writes.
    
     I have some code the nearly does this, but I haven't got it actually
     working yet and I am on leave until mid January.
    
     I would recommend doing
    
     fs/drivers/md/raid1.c:
     -#define RESYNC_BLOCK_SIZE (64*1024)
     +#define RESYNC_BLOCK_SIZE PAGE_SIZE
    
     for now.

    [PATCH] Remove iso9660 check for sbsector < 660Mb
    
    From: Jon Burgess <mplayer@jburgess.uklinux.net>
    
    The iso9660 filesystem code checks that the "sbsector" option is
    positioned within the first 660Mb of the disk.
    
    Today the iso9660 filesystem is used on DVD's which are much bigger than
    660Mb and this check prevents the sbsector option being used to specify
    the location of the superblock of multisession DVD's.
    
    With this check removed I can mount the second session on a DVD-R by
    specifying the sbsector, even though the  firmware on that drive returns
    bogus data for the TOC.
    
    If an invalid large sector number is entered then a "request beyond end
    of device" error is reported elsewhere in the block code, but appears to
    do no damage.

    [PATCH] hugepage pagetable freeing fix
    
    From: "Seth, Rohit" <rohit.seth@intel.com>
    
    We recently covered a bug in mm/mmap.c on IA-64.  While unmapping a address
    space, unmap_region calls free_pgtables to possibly free the pages that are
    used for page tables.  Currently no distinction is made between freeing a
    region that is mapped by normal pages vs the pages that are mapped by
    hugepages.  Architecture specific code needs to handle cases where PTEs
    corresponding to a region that is mapped by hugepages is properly getting
    unmapped.  Attached please find a patch that makes the required changes in
    generic part of kernel.  We will need to send a separate IA-64 patch to use
    this new semantics.  Currently, so not to disturb the PPC (as that is the
    only arch that had ARCH_HAS_HUGEPAGE_ONLY_RANGE defined) we are mapping back
    the definition of new function hugetlb_free_pgtables to free_pgtables.

    In this case, though, the result is an:
    
    "Incorrect number of segments after building list" message.
    
    The macro __BVEC_START assumes a bi_idx of zero when the dm code can
    submit a bio with a non-zero bi_idx.
    The code has been tested on an 8 way / 8gb OSDL STP machine with a 197G
    lvm volume running dbt2 test.

    [PATCH] change two annoying messages from framebuffer drivers
    
    From: Michael Hunold <hunold@convergence.de>
    
    the Linux-on-a-CD system Knoppix has nearly all framebuffer drivers for
    2.4.23 compiled in. Additionally, it surpresses most kernel messages by
    lowering the kernel log level.
    
    Two framebuffer drivers (clgenfb.c and hgafb.c), however, use KERN_ERR
    to say that their particular card has *not* been found which is very
    annoying.
    
    Especially the clgenfb.c driver simply says on bootup:
      >  Couldn't find PCI device
    which can really confuse newbie users.
    
    I've already send a patch that fixes this for 2.4 -- Marcelo and Geert
    Uytterhoeven have already ack'ed it.
    
    The same change should be done for 2.6, too IMHO.
    
    The appended patch replaces two KERN_ERR with KERN_INFO and additionally
    makes the cirrusfb.c message more descriptive.

    I found linux-2.6.0-test11 leaks memory when execve fails.  I've also

    The attached patch is a partial backout of bitkeeper rev.  1.87 of
    fs/exec.c.  I guess the original change was a simple mistake.
    (free_arg_pages() is a NOP when CONFIG_MMU is defined).

    This patch fixes the "non-terminating inflate" problem that Russell King
    complained about on LKML earlier today.
    
    I chose to use "goto" much like zlib does, in order to not require
    setjmp/longjmp inside the kernel.  It's a bit ugly, but it also lets each
    function chose how it needs to be terminated on error, which is a good
    thing.

    care about len and takes whole name.  So dirs and files with dots can be
    created on vfat fs.

    [PATCH] Put fixmaps into /proc/pid/maps via a pseudo-vma
    
    From: David Mosberger <davidm@napali.hpl.hp.com>
    
    This patch makes /proc/PID/maps report the range from FIXADDR_USER_START to
    FIXADDR_USER_END as a final pseudo-vma.  This is consistent with the notion
    that reading /proc/PID/maps tells you about every page containing data that
    the process can in fact access, and with things such as ptrace allowing
    access to this memory.  Without this, userland tools that want to look at all
    of a process's accessible pages need special-case knowledge about things such
    as the vsyscall DSO page.  With this change, existing code that iterates over
    the /proc/PID/maps lines will cover those pages like any other.  For example,
    this lets gdb's "gcore" command synthesize a core file from a live process
    that contains the vsyscall DSO page as a real core dump would, using its
    existing generic iterator code and no new special cases.

    [PATCH] Fix via686a/KX133 TSC failure
    
    From: Chris Bajumpaa <cbajumpa@or8.net>
    
    This patch fixes a problem with the TSC failing on via686a/KX133
    motherboards either reverting to using the pit or deadlocking the machine
    alltogether under heavy load.  (Specifically Abit KA7/KA7-100).
    
    Message from the log:
    Dec 18 18:20:37 grinder kernel: Losing too many ticks!
    Dec 18 18:20:37 grinder kernel: TSC cannot be used as a timesource. (Are
    you running with SpeedStep?)
    Dec 18 18:20:37 grinder kernel: Falling back to a sane timesource.
    
    The snippet of code that was missing from timer_tsc.c comes from
    timer_pit.c.

    [PATCH] Fix Summit EBDA parsing
    
    From: Matthew Dobson <colpatch@us.ibm.com>
    
    The code to parse the EBDA (Extended BIOS Data Area) for Summit boxen is
    broken because it does not handle Lookout boxen (external boxes full of
    additional PCI slots).  This patch cleans up some ugliness in
    arch/i386/kernel/summit.c as well as fixing the code to handle Lookout boxen
    and various other configurations of PCI buses.  Without this, Summit PCI bus
    to node mappings are totally hosed with Lookout boxen attatched.  This patch
    depends upon the GENERICARCH fix.

    Trying to build a kernel with both CONFIG_X86_GENERICARCH and

    [PATCH] Add signal state inheritance control to SELinux
    
    From: Stephen Smalley <sds@epoch.ncsc.mil>
    
    This patch against 2.6.0 adds a control to the SELinux module over the
    inheritance of signal-related state upon security context transitions in
    order to protect the new security context.  If the permission is not
    granted by the policy for a given pair of contexts, then transitions
    between them will clear itimers, flush all pending signals, forcibly
    flush signal handlers, and unblock all signals.  Roland McGrath provided
    input and feedback on the patch.
    Please apply, or let James Morris and me know if you'd like this to be
    resubmitted later.  Thanks.

    [PATCH] Remove use of nameidata by selinux_inode_permission
    
    From: Stephen Smalley <sds@epoch.ncsc.mil>
    
    This patch removes the use of nameidata by selinux_inode_permission, as this
    appears to be unsafe in certain cases (e.g.  path_walk call from
    rpc_lookup_parent), leading to an Oops if d_path is subsequently called by
    avc_audit on the (mnt,dentry) pair to generate a pathname for an audit
    message.
    
    The change does not affect the ability of SELinux to perform its permission
    check (which only requires the inode), only the set of information that is
    available for audit messages.  We'll investigate better approaches for the
    SELinux audit generation in the future.

    KDSKBENT/SENT ioctls to only check the corresponding SELinux permission,
    avoiding a change to the Linux permissions model for these operations.

    The compilation error was reported by Sam Ravnborg and again by Adrian
    Bunk.

    The dvb-ttpci/av7110 driver needs the firmware_class stuff to work now.
    
    IMHO the appropriate fix is to let the driver automatically select the
    firmware loader via Kconfig's SELECT facility.
    
    The dvb-ttusb-dec driver should behave like this, too.  (It currently
    depends on the FW_LOADER, which is not "the right thing" (tm))

    The "make rpm" rule in top Makefile isn't aware of the enviorment ARCH.  For
    example, people issue "make ARCH=ia64" to compile the ia64 kernel on i386
    platform for cross compilation.  This works pretty well now.  But if one uses
    "make rpm ARCH=ia64", it will fail.  Because current rpm rule in Makefile and
    mkspec are not aware of ARCH.

    This should ensure it doesn't ordinarily break the builds, but will error out if the
    builder requests it to.

    [PATCH] Updated osst driver for 2.6.x
    
    From: Willem Riede <wrlk@riede.org>
    
    Brings 2.6.x version of osst up to par with the 2.4.y version.
    Except for the /proc changes
    Tested against released 2.6.0 kernel.
    
    Changes from what's in the kernel tree today:
    
    - Fixes bug that files shorter than one 32K frame don't get written.
    - Fix a memory alloc/free mismatch that could have made your kernel unstable after rmmod osst.
    - Fix a number of tape (re)positioning bugs around filemarks that affected Amanda, Arkeia and
      Storix backup software.
    - Rationalize module parameters.
    - Fix time-out skipping to EOD
    - Write FM+EOD+Header-update when file write terminated by ioctl
    - Follow standard Unix behavior for read at EOD (return zero bytes read twice then error)
    - Implement SETBLK ioctl (allowed before first write only)

    [PATCH] Add char_devs to st
    This patch adds support for cdevs to the st driver. The changes are based on
    Doug Gilbert's corresponding changes to the sg driver. Using cdevs brings the
    following advantanges:
    - support for many drives, currently the maximum is set to 128; the minor
      number assignment is explained in the patch to Documentation/scsi/README.st
    - the tape devices appear in /sys/cdev/major/st*, as an example here are
      the entries for the first drive (4 modes, rewind and non-rewind
      devices):
      /sys/cdev/major/st0m0   /sys/cdev/major/st0m1   /sys/cdev/major/st0m2
      /sys/cdev/major/st0m3

    [PATCH] I2C: lm83 driver updates
    
    Here is a patch for the lm83 driver, to be applied on top of your
    pending patches stack. What it does:
    * Remove limit initialisation by the driver. This is a backport from
      CVS.
    * A few whitespace changes inspired by my recent porting of the lm90
      driver.

    [PATCH] I2C: velleman typo
    
    This patch replaces "K9000" with "K8000" everywhere (5 occurences) since
    it seems that the "K9000" was a typo in the first place. It also rewords
    the i2c-velleman doc. I have fixed it in our CVS repository too, and
    have been sending a similar patch to Marcelo for Linux 2.4.

    [PATCH] I2C: Fix SCx200 dependancies
    
    The following patch fixes incorrect dependencies (as far as I can see)
    for the SCx200 modules. A similar patch (with even more fixes) is also
    needed for Linux 2.4, and will be part of my next wave to Marcelo. Note
    that I don't have the necessary hardware to actually test anything, but
    a quick look at the code doesn't leave much place for doubt IMHO.

    [netdrvr sis900] add suspend/resume support
    
    The attached patch adds support for suspend/resume to the sis900 driver.
    With this patch on resume the NIC is fully configured and operational,
    before a module reload was needed because of the complete lack of
    suspend/resume callbacks.
    
    I added two functions, sis900_suspend and sis900_resume, with their
    pointers in struct pci_driver. A vector of 16 u32 was then needed to the
    to keep PCI data during suspend. I added it in struct sis900_private.
    I updated the revision number to reflect my changes.
    Looking at the code I also killed three typos.
    
    The patch doesn't touch any other code.
    
    Since I don't know anything on ethernet drivers the rule 'works for me'
    is fully valid.

    When we register disks, we mangle the disk names that contain slashes (e.g.

    name_to_dev_t() should mangle the name in the same way before looking for it
    in /sys/block.

    From: Jeff Garzik <jgarzik@pobox.com>
    
    I've seen this patch floating around.  Not sure the origin, but it's
    surfaced on lkml and also when I was poking around handhelds.org CVS for
    iPAQ patches:  on non-PCs, particularly system-on-chip devices but not
    just there, you have a custom "platform bus" that is the root of pretty
    much all other devices and buses.
    
    It's something I wanted to make sure people didn't forget; to make sure
    the legacy_bus didn't get "legacied out of existence."  ;-)

    [PATCH] synchronize use of mm->core_waiters
    
    From: Roland McGrath <roland@redhat.com>
    
    I believe I have identified a failure mode that Linus saw a couple weeks

    (while trying to track down other race failure modes we have yet to fix, sigh).
    
    I am talking about the following scenario:
    
    > Btw, even with the fix, doing a "while : ; ./crash t 10 ; done" will
    > eventually result in a stuck process:

    What happens here is a race between an exiting thread checking
    mm->core_waiters in __exit_mm, and the thread taking the core-dump signal
    (in coredump_wait) examining the first thread's ->mm pointer and
    incrementing mm->core_waiters to account for it.  There is no
    synchronization at all in __exit_mm's use of mm->core_waiters.  If the
    coredump_wait thread reads tsk->mm when tsk is in __exit_mm between
    checking mm->core_waiters and clearing tsk->mm, then it will increment
    mm->core_waiters and the total count will later exceed the number of
    threads that will ever decrement it and synchronize.  Hence it blocks forever.
    
    The following patch fixes the problem by using mm->mmap_sem in __exit_mm.
    The read lock must be held around checking mm->core_waiters and clearing
    tsk->mm so that coredump_wait (which gets the write lock) cannot come in
    between and do bogus bookkeeping.

    [PATCH] DAC960 request queue per disk
    
    From: Dave Olien <dmo@osdl.org>
    
    Here's a patch that changes the DAC960 driver from having one request
    queue for ALL disks on the controller, to having a request queue for
    each logical disk.  This turns out to make little difference for deadline
    scheduler, nor for AS scheduler under light IO load.  But under AS
    scheduler with heavy IO, it makes about a 40% difference on dbt2
    workload.  Here are the measured numbers:
    
    The 2.6.0-test11-D kernel version includes this mutli-queue patch to the
    DAC960 driver.
    
    For non-cached dbt2 workload  (heavy IO load)
    
    Scheduler	kernel/driver	NOTPM(bigger is better)
    AS		2.6.0-test11-D  1598
    AS		2.6.0-test11     973
    deadline	2.6.0-test11    1640
    deadline	2.6.0-test11-D  1645
    
    For cached dbt2 workload (lighter IO load)
    
    AS		2.6.0-test11-D  4993
    AS		2.6.-test6-mm4  4976, 4890, 4972
    deadline	2.6.0-test11-D  4998
    
    Can this be included in 2.6.0?  I know it's not a "critical patch"
    in the sense that something won't work without it.  On the other hand,
    the change is isolated to a driver.

    I've added an #ifdef __KERNEL__ so that userspace doesn't need to worry
    about the nbd_device structure, which is only used in-kernel. The patch
    allows me to compile my nbd tools with the 2.6 nbd.h.

    [PATCH] Allow unimap change on non fg console
    
    From: Kurt Garloff <garloff@suse.de>
    
    The comment in front of vt_ioctl() reads
    /*
     * We handle the console-specific ioctl's here.  We allow the
     * capability to modify any console, not just the fg_console.=20
     */
    
    Unfortunately, this does not apply to PIO_UNIMAPCLR, nor
    GIO_/PIO_UNIMAP. They always operate on the current foreground
    console, which is inconsistent at least. For most ioctls, the
    comment is applicable.
    
    It also causes problems, as setfont can't do the full job on
    the non-fg consoles. (OK, our setfont is slightly changed to
    even try it ... as you know.)
    
    The attached patch does fix this.
    
    I have a similar patch for 2.4, but it never got merged :-(
    because not many people seem to care and I submitted in the middle
    of the 2.4 series ...
    It has been in UnitedLinux/SUSE kernels for ages, though.

          Guillaume Morin <guillaume@morinfr.org>
    
    We need to clear the software dirty bit on the tail pages of a compound page
    when freeing it up.
    
    The tail pages can become dirtied by mmap'ing /dev/mem, and writing into
    any clustered page group (that a driver might have created or whatever).
    
    Plus it's better to run all these pages through the free_pages_check checks
    anyway.

    [PATCH] list_empty_careful() documentation.
    
    From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
    
    I'd also suggest the following patch below, to clarify the use of
    unsynchronized list_empty().  list_empty_careful() can only be safe in the
    very specific case of "one-shot" list entries which might be removed by
    another CPU.  (but nothing else can happen to them and this is their only
    final state.) list_empty_careful() is otherwise completely unsynchronized
    on both the compiler and CPU level and is not 'SMP safe' in any way.

    From: Badari Pulavarty <pbadari@us.ibm.com>
    
    I found the problem with O_DIRECT memory leak.
    
    The problem is, when we are doing DIO read and crossed the end of file - we
    don't release referencess on all the pages we got from get_user_pages().
    (since it is a success case).
    
    The fix is to call dio_cleanup() even for sucess cases.

    [PATCH] fix ELF exec with huge bss
    
    From: Roland McGrath <roland@redhat.com>
    
    The following test program will crash every time if dynamically linked.
    I think this bites all 32-bit platforms, including 32-bit executables on
    64-bit platforms that support them (and could in theory bite 64-bit
    platforms with bss sizes beyond the bounds of comprehension).
    
    	volatile char hugebss[1080000000];
    	main() { printf("%p..%p\n", &hugebss[0], &hugebss[sizeof hugebss]);
    	 system("cat /proc/$PPID/maps");
    	 hugebss[sizeof hugebss - 1] = 1;
    	 return 23;
    	}
    
    The problem is that the kernel maps ld.so at 0x40000000 or some such place,
    before it maps the bss.  Here the bss is so large that it overlaps and
    clobbers that mapping.  I've changed it to map the bss before it loads the
    interpreter, so that part of the address space is reserved before ld.so's
    mapping (which doesn't really care where it goes) is done.
    
    This patch also adds error checking to the bss setup (and interpreter's bss
    setup).  With the aforementioned change but no error checking, "ulimit -v
    65536; ./hugebss" will crash in the store after the `system' call, because
    the kernel will have failed to allocate the bss and ignored the error, so
    the program runs without those pages being mapped at all.  With this change
    it dies with a SIGKILL as for a failure to set up stack pages.  It might be
    even better to try to detect the case earlier so that execve can return an
    error before it has wiped out the address space.  But that seems like it
    would always be fragile and miss some corner cases, so I did not try to add
    such complexity.

    max_sectors when a merge_bvec_fn is present.

    [PATCH] Critical x86-64 IOMMU fixes for 2.6.0
    
    From: Andi Kleen <ak@muc.de>
    
    Please consider applying this patch, I would consider it critical for x86-64.
    
    The 2.6.0 x86-64 IOMMU code unfortunately had a few problems, leading
    to non booting systems and in a few cases to data corruption.
    
    It fixes a two serious bugs in handling special kinds of scatter gather
    lists in pci_map_sg.
    
    AGP was completely broken with IOMMU because of a wrong #ifdef.
    Fix that.
    
    One TLB flush optimization I did a long time ago seems to break on
    some 3ware boards (who require IOMMU because they don't support 64bit
    addresses).  The breakage lead to data corruption. This patch diables
    the optimization for now and fixes a potential SMP race in the flush
    code too. The TLB flush is done in a slower, but more reliable way
    now too.
    
    This patch fixes them. Please consider applying, because some of these
    problems hit quite many people.
    
    This also disables the IOMMU_DEBUG in the defconfig. A lot of people
    were using the IOMMU when they didn't need to, which multiplied the
    problems.
    
    IOMMU merge is disabled for now. This was an experimental optimization
    which helped with some block devices, but for production it seems to
    be better to disable it for now because there are some questionable
    corner cases when the IOMMU aperture fragments. The same is done
    for IOMMU SAC force, which was related to that.
    
    i386 has quite broken semantics for pci_alloc_consistent(). It uses
    the standard device DMA mask instead of the consistent mask. Make us
    bug-to-bug compatible here. This fixes problems with some sound
    drivers that don't support full 32bit addressing.

    [PATCH] Add a.out support for x86-64
    
    From: Andi Kleen <ak@muc.de>
    
    Add 32bit a.out support for x86-64.
    
    Not exactly an important bug fix, but maybe it will help someone.  This
    should increase the current 98% compatibility to i386 to perhaps 98.1% @)
    
    I tested an old a.out SuSE 4.2 installation in chroot and it worked.  It
    also ran some very old linux binaries from '92 found on ftp.funet.fi.  The
    only program that didn't was the SuSE a.out GNU emacs, but I was too lazy
    to track that down.  Core dumps are not supported.

    [PATCH] statfs64 fix
    
    From: Andi Kleen <ak@muc.de>
    
    It fixes the statfs64 emulation on x86-64.  The problem is that x86-64
    needs an __attribute__((aligned)) on the compat_statfs64 structure.  The
    conclusion last time this was discussed was that the structure should be
    duplicated.
    
    Essentially it is the old shared structure copied to every user and x86-64
    uses __attribute__((packed)).

    [PATCH] dm and bounce buffer panic fix
    
    From: Mark Haverkamp <markh@osdl.org>
    
    About three weeks ago markw at osdl posted a mail about a panic that he
    was seeing:
    
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=106737176716474&w=2
    
    I believe what is happening, is that the dm __clone_and_map function is
    generating bio structures with the bi_idx field non-zero.  When
    __blk_queue_bounce creates a new bio with bounce pages, it sets the bi_idx
    field to 0 rather than the bi_idx of the original.  This causes trouble since
    bv_page pointers will be dereferenced later that are zero.  The following
    uses the original bio structure's bi_idx in the new bio structure and in
    copy_to_high_bio_irq and bounce_end_io.
    
    This has cleared up the panic when using the volume.

    [PATCH] fix oops in proc_kill_inodes()
    
    proc_kill_inodes() walks the s_files list, playing with ->f_dentry.
    
    But there is a window in which __fput() will leave a file on that list with a
    null f_dentry and f_vfsmnt.
    
    I'm not sure it was ever confirmed that this fixed the reported oops, but it
    seems much better to set those fields to null _after_ removing the filp from
    the list.
    
    (Actually, there's no need to null those pointers out at all.  But whatever;
    it caught a bug).

    [PATCH] Remove CLONE_FILES from init kernel thread creation
    
    From: James Morris <jmorris@redhat.com>
    
    The patch below removes the CLONE_FILES flag from the kernel_thread() call
    which starts init.
    
    This is to prevent other kernel threads from sharing file descriptors
    opened by init (try 'lsof /dev/initctl' on a 2.6 system :-).
    
    The reason this patch is being proposed is so that usermode helper apps
    launched via kernel threads (e.g. modprobe, hotplug) do not then inherit
    any such file descriptors.  This is not a problem in itself so far (other
    than being messy), but it is a problem for SELinux, which will otherwise
    need to grant access to /dev/initctl by modprobe and hotplug, a somewhat
    undesirable scenario.
    
    As far as I can tell, there is no reason why init needs to be spawned with
    CLONE_FILES.  Please let me know if there are any objections to the
    change, which I would like to propose for 2.6.0+ as a cleanup.

    [PATCH] new /proc/irq cpumask format; consolidate cpumask display and input code
    
    From: Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>
    
    This patch is a followup to one from Bill Irwin.  On Nov
    17, he had consolidated the half-dozen chunks of code
    that displayed cpumasks in /proc/irq/prof_cpu_mask and
    /proc/irq/<pid>/smp_affinity into a single routine, which he
    called format_cpumask().
    
    I believe that Andrew Morton has accepted Bill's patch into
    his 2.6.0-test10-mm1 patch set as the "format_cpumask" patch.
    I hope that the following patch will replace Bill's patch.
    I look forward to Bill's feedback on this patch.
    
    The following patch carries Bill's work further:
    
     1) It also consolidates the input side (write syscalls).
     2) It adapts a new format, same on input and output.
     3) The core routines work for any multi-word bitmask,
        not just cpumasks.
     4) The core routines avoid overrunning their output
        buffers.
    
    Note esp. for David Mosberger:
    
        The small patch I sent you and the linux-ia64 list
        yesterday entitled: "check user access ok writing
        /proc/irq/<pid>/smp_affinity" for arch ia64 only is
        _separate_ from the following patch.  Neither presumes the
        other.  However, they do collide on one line.  Last one in
        is a Monkey's Uncle and will need an updated patch from me
        (or otherwise need to resolve the one obvious collision).
    
    Details of the following patch:
    
    Both the display and input of cpumasks on 9 arch's are
    consolidated into a single pair of routines, which use the
    same format for input and output, as recommended by Tony
    Luck.  The two common routines work on any multi-word bitmask
    (array of unsigned longs).  A pair of trivial inline wrappers
    cpumask_snprintf() and cpumask_parse() hide this generality
    for the common case of cpumask input and output.
    
    My real motivation for consolidating this code will become
    visible later - when I seek to add a nodemask_t that resembles
    cpumask_t (just a different length).  These common underlying
    routines will be used there as well, following up on a suggestion
    of Christoph Hellwig that I investigate implementing nodemask_t
    as an ADT sharing infrastructure with cpumask_t.  However, I
    believe that this patch stands on its own merit, consolidating
    a couple hundred lines of duplicated code, and making the
    cpumask display format usable on very large systems.
    
    There are two exceptions to the consolidation - the alpha and
    sparc64 arch's manipulate bare unsigned longs, not cpumask_t's,
    on input (write syscall), and do stuff that was more funky than
    I could make sense of.  So the input side of these two arch's
    was left as-is.  I'd welcome someone with access to either of
    these systems to provide additional patches.
    
    The new format consists of multiple 32 bit words, separated by
    commas, displayed and input in hex.  The following comment from
    this patch describes this format further:
    
    * The ascii representation of multi-word bit masks displays each
    * 32bit word in hex (not zero filled), and for masks longer than
    * one word, uses a comma separator between words.  Words are
    * displayed in big-endian order most significant first.  And hex
    * digits within a word are also in big-endian order, of course.
    *
    * Examples:
    *   A mask with just bit 0 set displays as "1".
    *   A mask with just bit 127 set displays as "80000000,0,0,0".
    *   A mask with just bit 64 set displays as "1,0,0".
    *   A mask with bits 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 set displays
    *     as "1,1,10117".  The first "1" is for bit 64, the second
    *     for bit 32, the third for bit 16, and so forth, to the
    *     "7", which is for bits 2, 1 and 0.
    *   A mask with bits 32 through 39 set displays as "ff,0".
    
    The essential reason for adding the comma breaks was to make
    the long masks from our (SGI's) big 512 CPU systems parsable by
    humans.  An unbroken string of 128 hex digits is pretty difficult
    to read.  For those who are compiling systems with CONFIG_NR_CPUS
    of 32 or less, there should be no visible change in format.
    
    There are of course a thousand possible output formats that
    meet similar criteria.  If someone wants to lobby for and seek
    consensus behind another such format, that's fine.  Now that
    the format is consolidated into a single pair of routines,
    it should be easy to adapt whatever we choose.
    
    Internally, the display routine uses snprintf to track the
    remaining space in its output buffer, to avoid the risk of
    overrunning it.
    
    A new file, lib/mask.c, is added to the lib directory, to
    hold the two common routines.  I anticipate adding a few more
    common routines for generic support of multi-word bit masks to
    lib/mask.c, in subsequent patches that will add a nodemask_t
    type as an ADT sharing implementation with cpumask_t.

    [PATCH] cpumask.h reorg
    
    From: Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>
    
    Push the cpumask implementation from linux/cpumask.h into asm/cpumask.h, so
    that ia64 can do special things without breaking sparc64.
    
    1) Each arch has its own include/asm-<arch>/cpumask.h file
    
    2) That arch-specific header file can include <asm-generic/cpumask.h>,
       if it wants to make use of the generic cpumask implementation.
    
    3) Using code should continue to include linux/cpumask.h, which
       in turn includes asm/cpumask.h.  Some common implementation
       independent cpumask related items, such as the cpu_online_map,
       are declared directly in linux/cpumask.h.

    [PATCH] PIIX5 Doesn't work on IA64
    
    From: Peter Chubb <peterc@gelato.unsw.edu.au>
    
    The PIIX5 IDE controller on I2000 IA64 boxen using the 460GX chipset will
    hang on startup if an ordinary harddrive is plugged into it (it seems to
    workj for the LSI120 and the CDROM drives).
    
    This is because the 460GX chipset contains a PCI expanssion bridge that
    works like the 450NX PXB, and has the same PCI ID (but a later revision).
    The PIIX driver, to work around interactions between PIIX4 and the 450NX
    PXB, tries to disable DMA.
    
    Unfortunately, the way it tries to disable DMA doesn't work, and the higher
    layers think that DMA is still on, and so timeout waiting for DMA, and then
    hang on bootup.
    
    A simple workaround is to tighten the check for the buggy chipset, as in
    the attached patch.  However, someone with more time (and who actually
    *understands* the IDE subsystem) needs to fix the real bug as well.

    - Moved "idetape_read_position" call in idetape_chrdev_open
      after the "wait_ready" call.
    
    - Added IDETAPE_MEDIUM_PRESENT flag so driver would know
      not to rewind tape after ejecting it.
    
    - Fixed bug with ide_abort_pipeline (it was deleting stages
      from tape->next_stage to end, instead of from
      new_last_stage->next (tape->next_stage was set to NULL
      by idetape_discard_read_pipeline before calling!).
    
    - Made improvements to idetape_wait_ready.
    
    - Added a few comments here and there.
    
    - Made MTOFFL unlock tape drive door before attempting to eject.
    
    - Added fixes to get Seagate STT3401A Travan working:
      Handle drives that don't support 0-length reads/writes increased timeout
      (retension takes ~10 minutes before irq is returned).
      Fixed request mode page packet command byte 3.
    
    Also remove code depending on NO_LONGER_REQUIRED to match 2.4.x (me).

    There is inconsistency in fops->write() implementation in different

    I think the correct implementation should always return number of bytes
    written (we examine all the buffer after all) otherwise "echo V >
    /dev/watchdog" doesn't work as expected (it doesn't stop watchdog).

    [PATCH] support centrino 1GHz
    
    From: Jeremy Fitzhardinge <jeremy@goop.org>
    
    I've been getting quite a lot of people mailing me about this CPU.  It
    seems Toshiba has released a machine with it.  It would be nice if this
    patch gets into a kernel soonish.  It's very low-impact.

    Once NR_CPUS exceeds about 300 ext2 and ext3 will not compile, because the

    Fix this by converting the percpu_counter mechanism to use alloc_percpu()
    rather than an NR_CPUS-sized array.

    fast path, 0.1% race with wakeup against writing the final result code:
    
    http://khack.osdl.org/stp/282936/environment/proc/slabinfo
    
    That means there is no immediate need to add the two-stage
    implementation to finish_wait.
    
    It reduces the spinlock operations on the semaphore array spinlock by 1/3.

    [PATCH] optimize ia32 memmove
    
    From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
    
    The memmove implementation of i386 is not optimized: it uses movsb, which is
    far slower than movsd.  The optimization is trivial: if dest is less than
    source, then call memcpy().  markw tried it on a 4xXeon with dbt2, it saved
    around 300 million cpu ticks in cache_flusharray():

    [PATCH] Restore /proc/pid/maps formatting
    
    The seq_file conversion of /proc/pid/maps caused altered behaviour with
    respect to 2.4.22.  Before the conversion, spaces and tabs in filenames were
    displayed verbatim.  After the conversion they are escaped as \040, etc.
    
    Also, if the mmapped file has been unlinked the output appears as
    
    40017000-40018000 rw-p 00000000 03:02 1425800    /home/akpm/foo\040(deleted)
    
    instead of
    
    40017000-40018000 rw-p 00000000 03:02 1425800    /home/akpm/foo (deleted)
    
    This could break applications which parse /proc/pid/maps (one person has
    reported this).
    
    The patch restores the 2.4.20 behaviour.

    [PATCH] vmscan: reset refill_counter after refilling the inactive list
    
    zone->refill_counter is only there to provide decent levels of work batching:
    don't call refill_inactive_zone() just for a couple of pages.
    
    But the logic in there allows it to build up to huge values and it can
    overflow (go negative) which will disable refilling altogether until it wraps
    positive again.
    
    Just reset it to zero whenever we decide to do some refilling.

    [PATCH] serial console registration bugfix
    
    From: Bjorn Helgaas <bjorn.helgaas@hp.com>
    
    uart_set_options() can dereference a null pointer.  This happens if you
    specify a console that hasn't previously been setup by early_serial_setup().
    
    For example, on ia64, the HCDP typically tells us about line 0, so we calls
    early_serial_setup() for it.  If the user specifies "console=ttyS3", we
    machine-check when trying to follow the uninitialized port->ops pointer.
    
    It's not entirely clear to me whether we should return 0 or -ENODEV or
    something.  The advantage of returning zero is that if the user specifies
    "console=ttyS0" and we just lack the HCDP, the console doesn't work as early
    as usual, but it does start working after the serial driver detects the port
    (though the baud/parity/etc from the command line are lost).  Returning
    -ENODEV seems to prevent it from ever working.

    [PATCH] Fix proc_pid_lookup vs exit race
    
    From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
    
    Fixes a race between proc_pid_lookup and sys_exit.
    
    - The inodes and dentries for /proc/<pid>/whatever are cached in the dentry
      cache.  d_revalidate is used to protect against stale data: d_revalidate
      returns invalid if the task exited.
    
      Additionally, sys_exit flushes the dentries for the task that died -
      otherwise the dentries would stay around until they arrive at the end of
      the LRU, which could take some time.  But there is one race:
    
      - proc_pid_lookup finds a task and prepares new dentries for it. It must
        drop all locks for that operation.
      - the process exits, and the /proc/ dentries are flushed. Nothing
        happens, because they are not yet in the hash tables.
      - proc_pid_lookup adds the task to the dentry cache.
    
      Result: dentry of a dead task in the hash tables.
    
      The patch fixes that problem by flushing again if proc_pid_lookup notices
      that the thread exited while it created the dentry.  The patch should go
      in, but it's not critical.
    
    
    - task->proc_dentry must be the dentry of /proc/<pid>.  That way sys_exit
      can flush the whole subtree at exit time.  proc_task_lookup is a direct
      copy of proc_pid_lookup and handles /proc/<>/task/<pid>.  It contains the
      lines that set task->proc_dentry.  This is bogus, and must be removed.
    
      This hunk is much more critical, because creates a de-facto dentry leak
      (they are recovered after flushing real dentries from the cache).

    [PATCH] Fix init_i82365 sysfs ordering oops
    
    From: Russell King <rmk@arm.linux.org.uk>
    
    This oops has been caused by the need to register the class before
    registering any objects against it.  Unfortunately, the class needs
    to be registered asynchronously in a separate thread to avoid driver
    model deadlock with yenta with cardbus cards inserted or standard
    PCMCIA cards not being detected correctly due to a race.
    
    I think the only real solution is to remove the class_device_create_file
    calls from all socket drivers.  This is just a simple commenting out of
    the calls, and should be suitable for the remainder of the -test kernels.
    
    Due to the number of cases that we're encountering with PCMCIA, I'm
    beginning to wonder if the driver model could be fixed to be more kind
    to PCMCIA by avoiding some of these ordering dependencies.  None of this
    would be a problem if the driver model would allow PCI device drivers to
    register PCI devices while their probe or remove functions were executing.

    [PATCH] Fix dcache and icache bloat with deep directories
    
    This fixes the recently-reported "fsstress memory leak" problem.  It has been
    there since November 2002.
    
    shrink_dcache() has a heuristic to prevent the dcache (and hence icache) from
    getting shrunk too far: it refuses to allow the dcache to shrink below
    2*nr_used.
    
    Problem is, _all_ non-leaf dentries (directories) count as used.  So when you
    have really deep directory hierarchies (fsstress creates these), nr_used is
    really high, and there is no upper bound to the amount of pinned dcache.
    
    The patch just rips out the heuristic.  This means that dcache (and hence
    icache (and hence pagecache)) will be shrunk more aggressively.  This could
    be a problem, and tons of testing is needed - a new heuristic may be needed.
    
    However I am not able to reproduce the problem which cause me to add this
    heuristic in the first place:
    
       Simple testcase: run a huge `dd' while running a concurrent `watch -n1
       cat /proc/meminfo'.  The program text for `cat' gets loaded from disk once
       per second.

    [PATCH] Use __GFP_REPEAT for cdrom buffer
    
    The cdrom driver does an order-4 allocation and the open will fail if that
    allocation does not succeed.  This happened to me on an unstressed 900MB
    machine.
    
    So add the __GFP_REPEAT flag in there - this will cause the page allocator to
    keep on freeing pages until the allocation succeeds.
    
    It can in theory livelock but in practice I expect it is OK: the user should
    just stop running dbench or whatever it is which is gobbling all the memory
    and the mount/open will then succeed.

    [PATCH] scale the initial value of min_free_kbytes
    
    This tunable refers to the amount of free memory which the VM will attempt to
    sustain.  It is mainly needed for atomic allocations (eg, networking
    receive).
    
    It is currently hardwired to 1024k, which is far too large for small machines
    and too small for large machines.
    
    Rework it to be 128k on tiny machines and 16M on huge machines.

    [PATCH] EFI support for ia32
    
    From: Matt Tolentino <metolent@snoqualmie.dp.intel.com>
    
    Attached is a patch that enables EFI boot-up support in ia32 kernels.
    
    In order to continue to determine whether the kernel should initialize using
    EFI tables, I've temporarily added a check on the LOADER_TYPE boot parameter.
     Although I haven't requested that elilo be assigned an id for this yet, I've
    used this to determine whether the kernel should use the EFI initialization
    path as well as a check to see if the EFI_SYSTAB boot parameter contains
    anything.  If someone has a better suggestion for determining this, I'm
    open...
    
    This patch also uses the existing ioremapping functions to map the efi tables
    into kernel virtual address space.  I've added an option such that I could
    use Dave Hansen's boot_ioremap() before paging_init().  After paging_init, I
    then remap the efi memmap using bt_ioremap for use later.  This has
    eliminated the need for several functions...thanks for the suggestions and
    thanks for your help Dave.  Still this could use a look-see.

    [BRIDGE]: Fix loopback over bridge port.
    
    When sending a broadcast from a Linux bridge over a bridge port,
    net/ipv4/ip_output.c::ip_dev_loopback_xmit() will send the packet back
    to the bridge port. Currently, the bridge code will intercept this
    loopback packet and try to bridge it. This is not right, the loopback
    packet doesn't even have an Ethernet header. This loopback packet is
    intended for the bridge port and should not be stolen by the bridge code.
    The patch below fixes this by adding a check in __handle_bridge().
    It also changes br_netfilter.c by only doing the paranoid checks of
    br_nf_post_routing() when CONFIG_NETFILTER_DEBUG is set. I think the
    loopback fix will get rid of any skbuffs matching those paranoid checks.
    
    The patch also introduces/removes some whitespace in br_netfilter.c.

    Actually how about this one instead?  The PEGASUS bit is the same.
    The difference is that MII (and CRC32) are only attributed to the
    driver code that needs those ... AX8817X needs both, ZAURUS just
    needs CRC32.  The core (which should eventually become a separate
    module) shouldn't depend on those modules at all.
    
    Also both CDCETHER and AX8817X are marked as non-experimental;
    I recall Dave Hollis submitted a patch to do that for AX8817X,
    and CDCETHER now seems to have gotten enough success reports too.

    Currently, report events from hid cause hiddev to generate empty
    hiddev_event events when HIDDEV_FLAG_UREF is not set.

    ia64: hugepage_free_pgtables() bug-fix
    
    	When there are two huge page mappings, like the two in the example
    	below, first one at the end of PGDIR_SIZE, and second one starts at
    	next PGDIR_SIZE (64GB with 16K page size):
    
    	8000000ff0000000-8000001000000000 rw-s
    	8000001000000000-8000001010000000 rw-s
    
    	Unmapping the first vma would trick free_pgtable to think it
    	can remove one set of pgd indexed at 0x400, and it went ahead
    	purge the entire pmd/pte that are still in use by the second
    	mapping. Now any subsequent access to pmd/pte for the second
    	active mapping will trigger the bug.  We've seen hard kernel
    	hang on some platform, some other platform will generate MCA,
    	plus all kinds of unpleasant result.

    [PATCH] Fix context switch accounting
    
    Noted by Nick Piggin, fix based on a patch by Linus.
    
    I've done some additional cleanups: fixed a compilation warning on UP
    and cleaned up the goto pick_next_task code.  Moved the 'unlikely' to
    the test as a whole.
    
    I've tested this patch and the context-switch stats look OK.

    Add support for checking before-the-fact whether an IRQ is
    already registered or not. The x86 PCI layer wants this for
    its availability testing.
    
    Doing a request_irq()/free_irq() pair to check this condition
    like we used to do can lock the machine if the irq happens to
    be screaming.

    [ARM PATCH] 1718/1: vidc.c: remove vidc_mksound, add external reference clock
    
    Patch from Peter Teichmann
    
    vidc_mksound causes the kernel to crash badly when executed. As it does not do anything useful I did not take the time to find out why, but removed it.
    
    The vidc does have an external reference clock that is used to generate 44100/20050/10025kHz sample rates. The code is changed in a way that it uses that reference clock that can better approximate the desired clock.
    
    If we can approximate the desired rate to more than 1/256 accuracy, we return the desired rate instead of the real rate. This is to assist using some programs that for instance believe they need exacly 8kHz which we can not have, but we can have 8.018kHz which is pretty close so that nobody would notice the difference.

      and host accounting.
    
    - Get rid of packet semaphore.
    
    - Move bus registration into core ieee1394 initialization.

      this one pristine.
    
    - Fix PCILynx so that it checks for errors on calls to copy_from_user().
    
    - Add ARM API handlers to raw1394.

    [ARM] Ensure that /proc/uptime returns sensible figures.
    
    When we set xtime at boot from the RTC, we weren't setting the
    monotonic time offset.  This had the effect of making the uptime
    rather large.
    
    We get around this problem by using the do_settimeofday() to set
    the current time.  do_settimeofday() knows about this issue, and
    will apply the appropriate correction to the monotonic time offset
    for us.

    ok, attached patch does it that way and also fixes two other problems I
    noticed:
    
    1. unloading the module with two controllers present didn't work,
    2. there was a race in is_complete.

    smp_call_function() must not be called from interrupt context (can
    deadlock on tasklist_lock).  Use keventd to call smp_call_function().

    [PATCH] ia64: sync pal/sal/salinfo/mca with 2.4 code
    
    Forward port the recent changes to pal.h, sal.h, mca.h, salinfo.c and
    mca.c from 2.4.23-rc2 to 2.6.0-test9.
    
    This converts 2.6 to use salinfo instead of printing CMC/CPE/MCA/INIT
    records in the kernel.  It makes the two kernel versions as close
    together as possible.

    [PATCH] ia64: initialize bootmem maps in reverse order
    
    The arch-independent bootmem code now requires that arches initialize
    their bootmem maps in reverse order (in particular, from high to low
    addesses), otherwise alloc_bootmem_pages_low() won't work.  This change
    makes the ia64 code do just that, so that machines without an IOMMU can
    allocate their bounce buffers in low memory at early boot.  It also adds
    a sanity check to the early init code to make sure that each node has a
    local data area, because if they don't, many things will break later on
    and may be hard to track down.

    [PATCH] Status Query On My MCT-U232 Patch
    
    Brief Patch Description:
    
    Fix a problem in the 'mct_u232' driver whereby output data gets held up in the
    USB/RS-232 adapter for RS-232 devices which don't assert the 'CTS' signal.
    
    Background:
    
    The Belkin F5U109 is a 9-pin USB/RS-232 adapter that is supported by the
    existing 'mct_u232' kernel module.  Recently, I've been testing it under the
    2.4.22 (Slackware 9.1) kernel and the 2.6.0-test9 kernel.
    
    I've connected a Garmin 'GPS35 TracPak' GPS receiver (RS-232 interface) and an
    ordinary RS-232 external modem to my PC's USB port via the Belkin F5U109
    adapter.
    
    Problem:
    
    Although _reads_ from either of the RS-232 devices mentioned above work fine
    via the Belkin adapter, _writes_ to the GPS receiver are not being seen by
    the GPS.  Writes to the modem, however, work perfectly.
    
    Aside: The 'Linux USB Users' archives show that at least one other person
    (circa May 2002) had the exact same problem I'm having, but it sounds like no
    solution was ever determined because the person in question just bought a
    different USB/RS-232 adapter.
    
    Investigation:
    
    Using the 'seyon' terminal emulator in Linux and a crude hardware RS-232
    "breakout box" that I hacked together, I've determined that the problem is
    related to the RTS/CTS RS-232 hardware handshaking.
    
    After further investigation, I've concluded that RS-232 devices which do not
    assert the 'Clear To Send' ('CTS') signal prevent the Belkin F5U109 adapter
    from transmitting data to the RS-232 device when the current (version 1.1)
    'mct_u232' module is used. The data gets "queued up" (up to a point -- 16
    bytes, I think) in the adapter but never transmitted.
    
    Since this GPS receiver works perfectly (reads and writes) when connected to a
    PC running W98se using the same Belkin adapter and the Belkin-supplied
    Windows driver, the Linux driver became suspect.
    
    After some testing with SniffUSB, I found that the Windows driver sends a
    couple of unique undocumented USB 'device requests' that the Linux driver
    does not. As it turns out, the second of those 2 requests is critical in
    making the adapter transmit data to a device which doesn't assert 'CTS'.
    
    For completeness, the Windows driver in use was determined from the 'Device
    Manager', 'Driver File Details' page:
    
       U2SPORT.VXD
       Provider: Magic Control Technology
       File version: 1.21P.0104 for Win98/Me
    
    Solution:
    
    My patch adds the 2 missing USB 'device request' commands right after a
    baud-change command. This mimics the operation of the W98 driver.
    
    Unfortunately, after much testing, I found no other operation (besides a
    baud-change request) under Windows that triggers either of these 2 'device
    request' commands. This makes it impossible to fully document the behavior of
    these requests, but I've made entries for them alongside the others in the
    'mct_u232.h' file.
    
    Purely for clarity, the patch also modifies various comments in 'mct_u232.h',
    mostly to reflect proper sizes of the various 'USB Device Request' fields per
    the USB 1.1 specification.
    
    The patch also updates the version number of the driver, corrects a minor
    typographical error, and documents a difference in the length of the data in
    a 'baud rate change' command for certain adapters which use a coded baud-rate
    rather than the conventional RS-232 baud rate divisor.
    
    I've provided (tested) patches for both the 2.4.22 and the 2.6.0-test9
    kernels.
    
    Please note that the changes to 'mct_u232.h' apply to both 2.4.22 and
    2.6.0-test9 since that file has not changed between those kernel releases.
    Nevertheless, I've included that (same) portion of the patch in both
    attachments for simplicity.

    as 2.4, so that people can keep their setups. It also fixes japanese and
    korean key handling.

    [PATCH]  Synaptics: use serio_reconnect
    
    Input/Synaptics:
      1. Support for pass-through port moved from Synaptics driver to psmouse
         itself, it is cleaner and should allow using it in other drivers if
         needed.
      2. The driver makes use of new reconnect functionality in serio. It will
         try to keep the same input device after resume or when it resets itself.
      3. If mouse is disconnected or other mouse plugged in while sleeping the
         driver should correctly recognize that and create a new serio/input
         device.

           When loading a new device or a new handler try to match device

           This allows to get rid of "surprises" in connect functions, IMO
           connect should only fail when it physically can not connect, not
           because it decides it does not like device.

    [PATCH] [RFC]  fix compile erros in ini9100 driver
    
    The attached patch fixes the compile errors from the DMA and scsi_cmnd
    next usage. It has been tested on bugzilla here:
    http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213
    
    I was not sure about the variable casting in the driver, but this is how
    the qlogicisp driver did it. The driver also still needs to be converted
    to the new error handling.

    Ok here's a new patch.  Updates:
    
      - check pci_set_dma_mask return value
      - fix leak in the HBA remove path
      - fix leak in probe_one failure case
      - remove unused list of hosts
      - avoid scsi.h usage all over driver
      - mention the updates in the README file

    [PATCH] convert inia100 to new probing API
    
    Hi Doug,
    
    you've been the last who touched inia100.c, so I may assume you
    actually have the hardware?  I've updated the driver to the new
    pci probing and scsi host registration code and it would be cool
    if someone could test it so we could merge it into early 2.6.

    sg: char_devs + seq_file lk2.6.0t9
    
    From: 	Douglas Gilbert <dougg@torque.net>
    
    This is an updated patch for the sg driver that takes into
    account Patrick LaVarre's fix for negative reserved buffer
    sizes found in lk 2.6.0-test9.
    
    So it has the same changelog to the patch I sent on 2003/10/11:
         - add "struct cdev" [char_devs] objects to increase
           maximum number of sg devices from 256 to 8192
         - use seq_file interface for /proc/scsi/sg/*
           pseudo files
         - sysfs symlinks between the sysfs scsi device and the
           corresponding sg cdev node (and vice versa)
    
    An edited "tree" output showing an example of these symlinks
    was included in my previous post.
    
    As noted in another thread, st (and osst) may need "cdevs"
    and sysfs symlinks so SCSI tape devices have sysfs visibility
    in lk 2.6 .
    
    Also if both st and sg had sysfs visibility then Patrick
    Mansfield's scsi_id program could be made to work for tape
    drives (enclosures, tape robots, etc) by following these
    symlinks.

    [libata promise] fix another ugly bug
    
    For the SX4, only one Host DMA (local DIMM) engine is on the hardware,
    while there is an ATA engine for each SATA port.  This means that
    Host DMA transactions must be queued.  When previously fixing this problem
    (the driver had previously assumed an HDMA engine per port), I stored
    the HDMA packet queue in a per-port data structure.
    
    This was incorrect:  this patch changes it to correctly use a
    per-host data structure, not a per-port structure.

    [PATCH] aha1740.c: Allow level triggered interrupts to be shared
    
    Hi.
    
    The patch below (against 2.6.0-test8) makes it possible to share the
    interrupt when the aha1740 is configured for a level triggered interrupt.
    It appears to work fine on my i486 EISA box with an AHA-1742A and an NE3200
    Ethernet board sharing an irq. Comments, please.

    From: 	Matthew Wilcox <willy@debian.org>
    
    2.1.18f:
     - Rewrite the Kconfig help
     - Always honour CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX_IOMAPPED.  Alpha people used to
       have it forced off, Sparc people used to have it forced on.  (Thanks
       to Dann Frazier for testing on Alpha)
     - Simplify the NVRAM handling a bit.
     - SYM_OPT_NO_BUS_MEMORY_MAPPING is never set.
     - Remove PCI DMA abstraction.  (Christoph Hellwig)
     - Redo SCSI midlayer registration and unregistration to allow module
       load/unload to work.  Now copes with scsi_add_host() failing.  (Thanks
       to Brian King for testing)
     - Replace bcmp() with memcmp().
     - Change the MAINTAINER entry to myself.

    Matthew Wilcox pointed out that it was already marked ISA only.
    I actually ment to change another driver, but looking at the source of one
    it seems to be 64bit unclean too.
    
    As there are 64bit architectures that have ISA slots (like old Alphas)
    I think this patch is still appropiate.

    [PATCH] scsi_debug lk 2.6.0t6
    
    This small patch adds a "release" method to the "pseudo_0"
    device to stop the noise when the scsi_debug module is
    loaded.
    
    Another annoyance that I was unable to get to the bottom
    of was during "rmmod scsi_debug" **:
      Synchronizing SCSI cache for disk sda: <4>FAILED
        status = 0, message = 00, host = 1, driver = 00
    That is a DID_NO_CONNECT error. So the LLD host is
    being shut down before the sd driver gets a chance to
    send through a SYNCHRONIZE CACHE command. If the user
    instigates a rmmod (as distinct from the hardware
    saying the host/device is gone), shouldn't a window
    be left open for such a flushing type command. This
    problem seems to have appeared recently.
    
    
    ** "echo -1 > add_host" in scsi_debug's driver directory
       (i.e. remove a host) also causes the same error so the
       problem is not perculiar to rmmod.

    [PATCH] I2C: lm75 chip driver conversion routine fixes
    
    This patch is based on the lm_sensors project CVS, from revisions 1.45 and 1.1
    of lm75.c and lm75.h, respectively.
    
    The patch fixes the conversion routines (according to datasheet) and moves
    them into a header file - as these conversions can be used by several drivers
    which emulate LM75s as subclients.  Also, temps are now reported in 1/1000 C
    in sysfs as per documentation.

    This patch fixes i2c_smbus_write_byte() being broken for i2c-amd8111.
    This causes trouble when that module is used together with eeprom (which
    is also in 2.6). We have had no report so far, but the problem is
    similar to the one addressed by a recent patch to i2c-nforce2.
    
    Credits go to Hans-Frieder Vogt for finding and fixing the problem. Mark
    D. Studebaker found and fixed the original problem in i2c-nforce2.
    
    This is a serious bug fix, and I believe you shouldn't wait too long
    before applying it.

    [PATCH] Fwd: Re: Atmel - possible SKB leak?
    
    Jeff,
    
    Atmel driver in 2.6.0-test11 is leaking SKBs if card gets disassociated
    from an AP when it's about to transfer packet. Simon (atmel maintainer)
    is OK with the patch. Given the fact that we are leaking memory I think
    it may be beneficial to push it to Linus (if you like the patch).

    [PATCH] USB: <linux/usb_ch9.h> new descriptor codes, types
    
    This patch adds definitions:
    
      - New "video" class, for video cameras and more complicated devices;
    
      - New "Interface association" descriptor type, used by video class,
        along with two other assigned desciptor type codes (OTG, "debug")
        listed in the same ECN to the USB 2.0 spec;
    
      - Type declarations for "Interface association" and OTG descriptors.
    
    It also replaces three copies of USB_DT_CS_* declarations in audio
    support with one in <linux/usb_ch9.h>, and uses the newly exposed
    symbol in "usbnet".  (Near as I can tell, the convention for those
    "class specific" descriptor types started with audio, and was then
    adopted by several other class specifications.)

    [PATCH] USB: usb driver binding fixes
    
    There are problems lurking in the driver binding code for usb,
    with highlights being disagreements about:
    
        (a) locks: usb bus writelock v. BKL v. driver->serialize
        (b) driver: interface.driver v. interface.dev.driver
    
    Fixing those is going to take multiple patches, and I thought
    I'd start out with a small one that's relatively simple.  This:
    
        - Cleans up locking.
    
            * Updates comments and kerneldoc to reflect that the
              usb bus writelock is what protects against conflicts
              when binding/unbinding drivers to devices.
    
            * Removes driver->serialize ... not needed, since
              it's only gotten when the bus writelock is held.
    
            * Removes incorrect "must have BKL" comments, and one
              bit of code that tried to use BKL not the writelock.
    
        - Removes inconsistencies about what driver is bound to the
          interface ... for now "interface.driver" is "the truth".
    
            * usb_probe_interface() will no longer clobber bindings
              established with usb_driver_claim_interface().
    
            * usb_driver_release_interface() calls device_release_driver()
              for bindings established with probe(), so the driver model
              updates (sysfs etc) are done as expected.
    
            * usb_unbind_interface() doesn't usb_driver_release_interface(),
              since release() should eventually _always_ call unbind()
              (indirectly through device_release_driver).
    
    Essentially there are two driver binding models in USB today,
    and this patch makes them start to cooperate properly:
    
       - probe()/disconnect(), used by most drivers.  This goes
         through the driver model core.
    
       - claim()/release(), used by CDC drivers (ACM, Ethernet)
         and audio to claim extra interfaces and by usbfs since it
         can't come in through probe().  Bypasses driver model.
    
    That interface.driver pointer can be removed by changing the
    claim()/release() code to use the driver model calls added
    for that purpose:  device_{bind,release}_driver().  I didn't
    do that in this patch, since it'll have side effects like
    extra disconnect() calls that drivers will need to handle.
    
    A separate usbfs patch is needed to fix its driver binding;
    mostly just to use the right lock, but those changes were
    more extensive and uncovered other issues.  (Like, I think,
    some that Duncan has been noticing ...)

    not on Logitech's website), but should be there soon. In addition, the

    [PATCH] USB: don't send any MODE SENSE commands to usb mass storage devices
    
    This patch basically eliminates the use of MODE_SENSE or MODE_SENSE_10 for
    direct-access USB storage devices.  That $&%*! command has caused us more
    trouble than all the others combined, and after more than a year we still
    don't have a good way of handling/using them.
    
    I constantly get complaints about devices which don't work because of the
    way 2.5/6 uses MODE_SENSE and MODE_SENSE_10 -- this patch will greatly
    increase compatiblity with devices.  As with the patch to limit transfer
    sizes, I'd like to see this applied as soon as possible.

    [PATCH] USB storage: patch for unusual_devs.h
    
    I send a patch and copy of /proc/bus/usb/devices for my 5`25 external
    USB enclosure. I don't know exactly manufacturer of this device, but
    model is CD-509.
    It will be nice if it helps somebody else.

    firmware works the same way.

    [PATCH] USB storage: patch for Kyocera S5 camera
    
    I've seen some entries in 2.4.22 and 2.6.0 unusual_devs.h
    for Kyocera Finecam S3 et S4 cameras and I own a Finecam S5
    that does not work out of the box either
    (here is the beast : http://www.yashica.com/digital/finecams5/finecams5.html)
    
    so I found the unusual_devs.h entry and submitted it some month
    ago at http://www.qbik.ch/usb/devices/showdev.php?id=1626
    for the 2.4 kernels
    
    I thought It would be nice to have the whole Finecam family
    in Unusual_devs.h for 2.6.0
    
    The patch for the 2.6.0-test9 is attached with this mail
    
    It differs from the entry I submitted at www.qbik.ch
    as I used the new SC/PR_DEVICE flags and got rid of the
    IGNORE_SER flag from 2.4
    
    Do you want a patch for 2.4 too ? If so, I should test my
    old 2.4 entry with the lastest 2.4 Kernels, coz on a daily
    basis I use a 2.4.20, which is rather old. Moreover, I could
    used the SC/PR_DEVICE flags too for 2.4.22 (keeping the IGNORE_SER flag
    though)
    
    
    By the way, several entries with the running patch :

    [PATCH] USB: usb_hcd_unlink_urb() test for list membership
    
    This is a minor cleanup that replaces a test for non-null urb->hcpriv
    with "is the urb on this list".  HCDs don't need to use hcpriv in that
    way, and in general this is a safer way to test that.  (AIO does much
    the same thing in its kiocb cancelation paths.)

    Okay, here it is.  This patch basically just adds comments.  Each routine
    that uses the new scatter-gather function gets a brief explanation of
    what's going on, and access_xfer_buf() itself gets detailed comments
    saying what it's doing and why it's necessary.  You may even want to cut
    some of it back; I was pretty verbose.

    [PATCH] USB storage: Fix scatter-gather buffer access in usb-storage core
    
    This patch adds a routine to protocol.c that correctly transfers data to
    or from a scatter-gather buffer.  According to Jens Axboe, we've been
    using page_address() incorrectly -- it's necessary to use kmap() instead
    -- and in fact it doesn't give the desired result when the buffers are
    located in high memory.  This could affect anyone using a system with 1 GB
    or more of RAM, and one user has already reported such a problem (as you
    know).
    
    The three fixup routines in protocol.c and usb.c have been changed to use
    the new s-g access routine.  When similar adjustments have been made to
    all the subdrivers, we will be able to eliminate the raw_bulk.c source
    file entirely.

    [PATCH] USB storage: Remove unneeded scatter-gather operations in sddr09
    
    This patch removes some unnecessary scatter-gather code from the sddr09
    driver.  In its place a single smaller buffer is re-used each time through
    an I/O loop, as opposed to transferring all the data at once.
    
    Andries Brouwer kindly tested this and suggested some improvements to get
    it working right.

    [PATCH] USB: khubd optimization
    
    It changes spin_lock_save() to spin_lock() within the completion routine
    and list_del()/INIT_LIST_HEAD() to list_del_init().  It's nothing more
    than a minor optimization.

    [PATCH] USB: ohci, fix iso "bad entry" bug + misc
    
    A while back there were some reports of ohci reporting a "bad entry"
    diagnostic, mostly with ISO transfers, which were mysterious until
    I recently found an easy way to reproduce it.
    
    This patch:
    
      - Fixes at least one cause of that "bad entry" diagnostic by
        waiting for INTR_WDH before completing ED unlink processing.
        (Else URB unlinking could free TDs on the donelist, so the
        WDH processing would see those entries as "bad".)
    
      - Merges the patch from Darwin Rambo <drambo@broadcom.com>,
        coping with CPUs that can't do 16 bit accesses (MIPS).
    
      - Renames a function as start_ed_unlink(), matching its role.
    
      - Fixes minor debug output issues, including a FIXME to tell
        more info about TDs on the periodic schedule.  And adding
        some missing newlines (makes this patch seem big).
    
    Nobody's complained much about that "bad entry" issue lately, but
    if necessary that part would be particularly easy to split out.
    
    Please merge to the next kernel that gets USB patches.

    [PATCH] USB storage: Issue CBI clear_halt and fix BBB residue
    
    This patch does 2 things (bad, I know -- but they're both pretty small
    and pretty obscure).
    
    The CBI specification states in section 2.4.3.1.3 that
    
    	... the host shall also issue Clear Feature for Endpoint Halt
    	to the Bulk In pipe if the device reports that the Data In
    	command block has Failed.
    
    along with a note in section 2.5.3 that Data Out commands should work
    analogously.  This patch does that, along with cleaning up the status
    detection logic a little.
    
    For Bulk-only transfers we currently ignore the dResidue field in the CSW,
    except for reporting it (without byte-swapping!) in a debug message.  The
    patch uses it to compute the residue value returned to the SCSI layer.
    Note that the Bulk-only spec allows devices to transfer more data than
    they actually use (i.e., they may add padding or ignore stuff) and then
    inform the host of this by means of the dResidue value.  The logic used is
    simple: our reported residue is the larger of what the device claims and
    what we didn't transfer, except that it can't be larger than the total
    transfer length.

    [PATCH] USB storage: Command failure codes for sddr09 driver
    
    This patch updates the sdd09 subdriver to make it return Command Failure
    with appropriate sense data (rather than Tranport Error) when:
    
    	a MODE-SENSE command requests an unsupported page;
    
    	a CDB includes an unrecognized command code.
    
    This should help prevent confusion and excessive retrying by the SCSI
    drivers.

    [PATCH] USB: fix comment in usblp
    
    I know Linus is not taking cleanups at this point, but perhaps
    you can delete it in your tree. Seems like someone (Oliver?)
    fixed all the garbage in old printer.c, so the comment is not
    needed anymore.
    
    I reviewed changes, and usblp.c looks correct. I'm doing backport
    to 2.4 for Fedora right now.

    [PATCH] I2C: make I2C chipset drivers use temp_hyst[1-3]
    
    Summary of the changes:
    adm1021.c: No changes, that chipset uses a real min/max model.
    eeeprom.c: No changes (obviously).
    it87.c:    Remove buggy comments (obviously taken from via686a) about
               max and min temperature limits being over and hyst. This
               isn't the case for this driver (min/max model).
    lm75.c:    Simple sysfs file name change (temp_min to temp_hyst).
    lm78.c:    Simple sysfs file name change (temp_min to temp_hyst).
    lm85.c:    No changes needed (min/max model).
    via686a.c: Rename functions and macros from min/max to hyst/over, what
               it really is. Remove unnecessary comments. Rename sysfs
               files from temp_min[1-3] to temp_hyst[1-3].
    w83781d.c: Rename variables from temp_min* to temp_hyst* (needed so
               that the macros keep working). Update macro calls
               accordingly. Fix writing temp to max and hyst being
               swapped.
    
    Additional remarks:
    
    The lm75 and lm78 having a single temperature channel, there is no
    number appended to the file names. Shouldn't a "1" be appended in this
    case? I think it would make it easier for the future library to catch
    all the files.
    
    I made sure the drivers would still compile after the changes, but did
    not test them otherwise (no working 2.6.0 kernel here, and not all the
    hardware anyway).

    [PATCH] I2C: sysfs interface documentation
    
    1* No more current hysteresis value. I don't think we ever saw a chip
       which monitors current, and if we ever do, I would be very, very
       surprised if it would have an hysteresis value.
    2* Temperature input and max can have 4 values. [from the previous
       patch]
    3* Split temperature min and hysteresis into two separate files.
    4* New file temp_crit. [from previous patch]
    
    The new file temp_crit is subject to change later as we decide more
    precisely how we want to handle values that are common to more than one
    temperature channels.

    [PATCH] I2C: Fix i2c-algo-bit for adapers that cannot read SCL back
    
    Here follows a patch to i2c-algo-bit.c as found in linux-2.6.0-test9,
    with two fixes for adapters that cannot read SCL back. Althouth real
    adapters should be able to read SCL back, there are some that
    cannot, for example the ADM1032 evaluation board I am using. Such
    adapters where supposed to be already supported, but I found a probable
    bug and improved support.
    
    These changes were applied to our i2c CVS repository two weeks ago and
    have been reviewed by Mark D. Studebaker.
    
    List of changes:
    
    * Fix sclhi() for adapters that do not have getscl().
    * Enable bit_test for adapters that do not have getscl().
    * Mostly rewrite test_bus(), cleaner and probably faster.

    keeping files in sync).

    to resetting them.

    [PATCH] ia64: fix samp_affinity user-space accesses
    
    Here is a new improved patch for verifying user access to string
    passed in to kernel on write to /proc/irq/<pid>/smp_affinity.
    
    The access_ok() but missing __get_user() on each byte earlier patch
    has been replaced with a copy_from_user().
    
    I have built it and verified that it handles write requests
    as before, on an ia64 system (well - you can no longer pass
    more than 14 spaces after the 'R' - tough).

    Turns out that some systems really need this stuff, as their BIOS hasn't
    set up the IORRs.

    [PATCH] USB: usbcore, better heuristic for choosing configs
    
    Until now, the Linux-USB core has always chosen the first device
    configuration, even when there was a choice.  In 2.4 kernels,
    device driver probe() routines were allowed to override that
    initial policy decisions.  But 2.6 kernels can't do that from
    probe() routines, causing problems with some CDC-ACM modems
    where the first config uses MSFT-proprietary protocols.
    
    This patch switches to a smarter heuristic:  Linux now prefers
    standard interface classes when there's a choice.  So those
    CDC-ACM modems don't need a "write bConfigurationValue in sysfs"
    step when they are connected; they act just like on 2.4 kernels.
    (And sysfs can still be used to handle any problem cases.)

    [ARM PATCH] 1678/1: correct and better do_div() implementation for ARM
    
    Patch from Nicolas Pitre
    
    Here's a rewrite of the ARM do_div() implementation.  It is much
    faster and smarter than the current code, and it also takes
    advantage of ARMv5+ instructions when target processor allows it.
    
    The current code also deserves to be killed ASAP since it overflows
    and fails to compute correct values in many cases.  For example:
    
    	u64 n = 2200000001;
    	u32 x = 2200000000;
    	u32 r = do_div(n, x);
    
    This currently returns n = 41 and r = 46829569 which is obviously bad.
    
    Another failing example is n=15000000000000000000 and x=3000000000.
