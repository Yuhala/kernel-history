    Mark the ACPI CPU throttle and timer IO regions busy.
    
    This should help some laptops where the generic PCI
    code might otherwise believe that this range is unused.
    The ACPI IO range is usually not visible as a standard
    BAR.

    [PATCH] Fix x86-64 compilation without iommu for 2.6.6rc3
    
    Various people hit this in earlier kernels. The x86-64 kernel did not compile
    without CONFIG_IOMMU_GART in various configurations. Just add the missing symbol
    and export it. Also export iommu_merge while I am at it.

    [PATCH] Fix machine check handler on x86-64
    
    This fixes a bug in the new machine check handler on x86-64.
    
    One nasty part was that when you got an MCE during boot up
    then it would not always print it on the screen, but still
    panic because it attempted to kill the idle task.
    
    This patch does:
     - Always use KERN_EMERG when printing MCEs
     - Always panic and print on screen before killing idle loop
       or init.

    do with the system setup.

    Waste less memory in dentries.
    
    We don't bother aligining them on a cacheline boundary, since
    that is totally excessive in some configurations (especially
    P4's with 128-byte cachelines).
    
    Instead, we make the minimum inline string size a bit longer,
    and re-order a few fields that allow for better packing on
    64-bit architectures, for better memory utilization.

    [PATCH] run populate_rootfs() before initcalls
    
    I moved this a little too late - we need to run populate_rootfs() before
    running initcalls because some driver initcalls need to open files for
    firmware.
    
    The populate_rootfs() call is still coming after init_idle(), so it won't
    knock the scheduler over.

    [TCP]: BIC TCP for Linux 2.6.6
    
    This is a version of Binary Increase Control (BIC) TCP
    developed by NCSU.   It is yet another TCP congestion control
    algorithm for handling big fat pipes. For normal size congestion
    windows it behaves the same as existing TCP Reno, but when window
    is large it uses additive increase to ensure fairness and when
    window is small it uses binary search increase.
    
    For more details see the BIC TCP web page
     http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/rhee/export/bitcp/
    
    The original code was for web100 (2.4); this version is pretty
    much the same but targeted for 2.6 with less sysctl parameters
    and more constants.
    
    I don't have a real high speed long haul network to test, but
    when running over 1G links with delays, the performance is more stable
    (ie tests are repeatable) and as fast as existing Reno.

    [NET]: Add sock_create_lite()
    
    The purpose of this is to allow sockets created by the kernel in this way
    to be passed through the LSM socket creation hooks and be labeled and
    mediated in the same manner as other sockets.
    
    This patches addresses a class of potential issues with LSMs, where such
    sockets will not be labeled correctly (if at all), or mediated during
    creation.  Under SELinux, it fixes a specific bug where RPC sockets
    created by the kernel during TCP NFS serving are unlabeled.

    [NET]: Add sock_create_kern()
    
    Under SELinux, and potentially other LSMs, we need to be able to
    distinguish between user sockets and kernel sockets.  For SELinux
    specifically, kernel sockets need to be specially labeled during creation,
    then bypass access control checks (they are controlled by the kernel
    itself and not subject to SELinux mediation).
    
    This addresses a class of potential issues in SELinux where, for example,
    a TCP NFS session times out, then the kernel re-establishes an RPC
    connection upon further user activity.  We do not want such kernel
    created sockets to be labeled with user security contexts.
    
    sock_create() and sock_create_kern() are wrapper functions, which seems
    semantically clearer to me than e.g. adding a flag to sock_create().  If
    you prefer the latter, then let me know.
    
    The patch also adds an argument to the LSM socket creation functions
    indicating whether the socket being created is a kernel socket or not.

    From: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>
    
    This one is a little funny.  The SGI trees don't show this issue because dmapi
    and quota are separate modules so they must be unloaded before xfs_fs_exit can
    be called at all.
    
    So let's move the exitcalls for them in mainline first to simulate that
    behaviour.

    [PATCH] Fix IO bitmap invalidate
    
    There is a bug where if any process that obtained an IO access
    permissions via ioperm() does not explicitly "drop" that permissions,
    the IO permissions don't get properly invalidated on process exit.
    
    The cause is that exit_thread() only invalidates the per-thread
    io_bitmap pointer, but doesn't invalidate the per-TSS io_bitmap pointer
    as well.
    
    As the per-thread pointer is invalidated, __switch_to() doesn't take
    care of that one either, so the per-TSS pointer stays valid as long as
    some other process does ioperm().
    
    This fixes the problem - it invalidates the per-TSS io_bitmap pointer
    and the problem goes away.

    When Patrick removed ide_notify_reboot() in 2.5.42, he didn't notice
    that it meant that IDE no longer had any shutdown() functionality.
    
    So we did the right thing on suspend, but not on shutdown.
    
    ide_notify_reboot() was only doing STANDBY on shutdown (because FLUSH
    'doesn't work' in 2.4 too) but it worked okay and we still should do STANDBY
    on shutdown because some broken disks flush their caches.
    
    Thus just calls bus->suspend() (FLUSH+STANDBY) at shutdown time.  We can
    add some safety delay later - 2.4 doesn't have any.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix nasty typo in PTE freeing code
    
    There is a typo in the PTE freeing code causing us to possibly

    Obvious fix (look at the closing parentheses).

    [PATCH] logips2pp driver update (MX510/310 support), cleanup
    
    I've updated the logips2pp driver to detect the MX310 and MX510 mice
    and also made it more maintainable by putting everything into one
    table instead of having 4 arrays for them (the MX700 support wasn't
    added correctly in the last revision).

    [PATCH] IDE disk cache flush at unopportune momemnts
    
    This makes the idedisk_release function only flush the cache on final
    release; with the recent 2.6 blocklayer updates release gets called
    somewhat frequently, and at times where IO is outstanding to the disk.
    
    This bug didn't trigger before simply because ide_cacheflush_p() always
    was a nop.

    [PATCH] ncpfs data corruption when using large TCP transfers
    
    ncpfs was forgetting to update iovec's iov_base field whenever partial
    transmission occured. This was causing data corruption during large
    (60kB) writes.
    
    The code now also passes copy of iovec to the sock_sendmsg, so it does
    not rely on network stack updating (or not updating) passed iovec in
    case of success (or failure).

    [PATCH] bug fix for megaraid memory leak
    
    I was going through the code looking for bits and pieces to pull across
    into the new LSI Logic beta megaraid driver /sys fs code and came across
    this one.
    
    LSI Logic have already fixed this issue for the 2.4 driver, and the new
    beta driver does not use the /proc filesystem at all, so no problem
    there.
    
    The problem is that resources are not freed upon certain error
    conditions in the in-kernel megaraid driver, to quote from Lester
    Hightower (who originally found the issue):
    
       "The problem occurs only in the circumstance where one reads one of
        the /proc/megaraid/hba<X>/diskdrives-ch<N> files where the card <X>
        does not have channel <N> on it.  Most people would likely not
        notice this leak in normal operation, but due to the way that we
        monitor our MegaRaid cards in our company (we read these /proc
        entries every 180s) so we found the leak rather quickly, and
        unpleasantly (when your kernel eats all your RAM)."
    
    Anyway, here is the fix, compiled and tested OK for me.

    [PATCH] bug in bigsmp CPU bringup
    
    There is an bug in bigsmp sub-architecture, due to which it will not
    enable all the CPUs when the BIOS-APICIDs are not 0 to n-1 (where n is
    total number of CPUs). Particularly, only 2 CPU comes up on a system
    that has 4 CPUs with BIOS APICID as (0, 1, 6, 7).=20
    
    The bug is root caused to check_apicid_present(bit) call in smpboot.c,
    when bigsmp is expecting apicid in place of bit.
    check_apicid_present(bit) in bigsmp subarchitecture checks the bit with
    phys_id_present_map (which is actually map representing all apicids and
    not bit).
    
    One solution is to change check_apicid_present(bit) to
    check_apicid_present(apicid), in smp_boot_cpus().  But, it can affect
    all the other subarchitectures in various subtle ways.  So, here is a
    simple alternate fix (Thanks to Martin Bligh), which solves the above
    problem.
    
    [ Confirmation from Martin:
    
         Looks fine, it's exactly the same fix we use for Summit.  Since
         we're using the other method instead of the bitmap, this check
         isn't needed, so we can just bypass it.  This way also has the
         great advantage of being isolated to the bigsmp subarch, so it only
         needs testing there ;-)

    [PATCH] fixup for C1 Halt Disconnect problem on nForce2 chipsets
    
    Based on information provided by "Allen Martin" <AMartin@nvidia.com>:
    
    A hang is caused when the CPU generates a very fast CONNECT/HALT cycle
    sequence.  Workaround is to set the SYSTEM_IDLE_TIMEOUT to 80 ns.
    This allows the state-machine and timer to return to a proper state within
    80 ns of the CONNECT and probe appearing together.  Since the CPU will not
    issue another HALT within 80 ns of the initial HALT, the failure condition
    is avoided.

    [PATCH] allow drivers to claim the lapic NMI watchdog HW
    
    Here is an updated lapic NMI ownership tracking patch which
    should address the issues that were raised with the first one:
    
    - Simplified the API function names to {reserve,release}_lapic_nmi().
    
    - Rewrote the ownership tracking code to use two individually named
      flags instead of using arithmetic and the sign. The code is now
      simple enough that no "hiding" macros are needed. (Thanks Albert
      for that suggestion.)

    During mqueue_get_inode(), it's possible that kmalloc() of the

    info->messages on mqueue_delete_inode() to determine whether the
    mqueue was every truly created, and hence proper accounting is needed
    on destruction.

    [SERIAL] 8250_hcdp needs irq sharing
    
    Patch from Alex Williamson
    
    Here's a trivial patch that makes 8250_hcdp setup the correct flags
    when IRQ sharing is enabled for serial ports.
    
    The HCDP table tells us if the device is a PCI UART.  We can use this
    to set the shared interrupt flag as well as program the interrupt with
    the correct polarity/trigger (should get rid of "changing vector <x>
    from IO-SAPIC-edge to IO-SAPIC-level" messages at bootup).  This also
    allows non-PCI UARTs to be left un-shareable, which is likely much
    more safe (edge triggered).
    
    The bit that I'm keying on is still part of the older 1.0a HCDP spec,
    so should be implemented (it was on all the boxes I tested).  If
    there's firmware out there that doesn't set this bit or the interrupt
    supported flag, the HCDP UART may run in polling mode, but should
    still be functional.

    [PATCH] report size of printk buffer
    
    From: <Andries.Brouwer@cwi.nl>
    
    In the old days the printk log buffer had a constant size, and dmesg asked
    for the 4096, later 8192, later 16384 bytes in there.  These days the
    printk log buffer has variable size, and it is not easy for dmesg to do the
    right thing, especially when doing a "read and clear".  The patch below
    adds a syslog subfuntion that reports the buffer size.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Updated boot fix
    
    This fixes booting on some PPC32 machines, notably CHRP and powermac
    machines.  This is a modified version of Tom Rini's patch that addresses
    the concerns I had with it.
    
    The problem was that the linker script was getting included in the list
    of things that got put together to make some of the sorts of bootable
    images that we produce.  This removes ld.script in cases where it wasn't
    appropriate and changes the rules in others so that although we have the
    dependency on ld.script, it doesn't get included in the list of things
    to link.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Use slbie, not slbia in hugepage code
    
    On PPC64, when we prepare segments below 4G for use with hugepages, we
    need to flush their entries from the SLB, in case SLB entries
    specifying normal pages were already present.
    
    Previously we did that by flushing the entire SLB, the patch below
    changes this to individually flush each necessary segment with slbie.
    The new version may well be slightly faster, but the real reason for
    it is so that this code path doesn't need to be changed to reinstate
    any bolted SLB entries, if we add them.  The existing version has
    already caused problems (read, crashes) when combined with some
    patches that add bolted SLB entries.

    [SPARC32]: Reduce fragmentation in the bitmap allocator
    
    The existing allocator is first-fit with wraparound.  This allows
    a large number of small holes to accumulate in the early part of the
    region, leading to heavy fragmentation.  This adjusts the algorithm
    to rescan the region when smaller sizes are requested, reducing
    early fragmentation.

    [PATCH] mcdx.c insanity removal
    
    The mcdx.c author had pulled off something absolutely amazing - he had
    declared several unsigned variables (ISA port numbers) as void *, using
    explicit cast to unsigned in almost all places that used them.
    Exception: printk.  There he proudly used them as pointers - with %3p in
    format.  That cute trick allowed him to avoid using %03x, which
    apparently scared him for some reason.
    
    Switched to use of unsigned, killed casts, replaced %3p with %03x in
    formats.  BTW, the code had been that way since the initial merge back
    in 1.3.7...

    [PATCH] ppc64: fix incorrect signal handler argument
    
    This fixes a bug in the ppc64 signal delivery code where the signal
    number argument to a signal handler can get corrupted before the handler
    is called.  The specific scenario is that a process is in a blocking
    system call when two signals get generated for it, both of which have
    handlers.
    
    The signal code will stack up two signal frames on the process stack
    (assuming the mask for the first signal delivered doesn't block the
    second signal) and return to userspace to run the handler for the second
    signal.  On return from that handler the first handler gets run with an
    incorrect signal number argument because we end up with regs->result
    still having a negative value (left over from when the system call was
    interrupted) when it should be zero.  This patch sets it to zero when we
    set up the signal frame (in three places; for 64-bit processes, and for
    32-bit processes for RT and non-RT signals).
    
    The way we handle signal delivery and signal handler return using the
    regs->result field in ppc64 is more complicated than it needs to be.  In
    ppc32 I have already simplified it and eliminated use of the
    regs->result field.  I am going to do the same in the ppc64 code, but I
    think this patch should go in for now to fix the bug.
    
    The patch also fixes a couple of places where we were unnecessarily and
    incorrectly truncating the regs->result value to 32 bits
    (sys32_sigreturn and sys32_rt_sigreturn return a long value, as all
    syscalls do, and if regs->result is negative we need those syscalls to
    return a negative value).
    
    Thanks to Maneesh Soni for identifying the specific circumstances
    under which this bug shows up.

    [IPV4/IPV6]: Fix listing of listening sockets.
    
    There is a bug in listening_get_first() which used by /proc/net/tcp*
    where it wasn't looping through all the sockets in each hash chain.
    This problem doesn't show up unless the first socket in a chain doesn't
    match the family that is being looked up.
    
    The following patch fixes this by getting rid of listening_get_first()
    altogether.

    [PATCH] add missing #include
    
    There's a subtle problem with "inline" usage in <linux/string.h>:
    
     <linux/string.h>:
            this pulls in __constant_c_and_count_memset()
    
     <linux/mm.h>:
            this pulls <compiler.h>, re-defining
            inline == __inline__ __attribute__((always_inline)).
    
     But by now it is too late! The compiler has already seen the bare
     "inline" in string.h, and hasn't inlined it.
    
    Result:
    
    	# grep __constant System.map
    	c0144670 t __constant_c_and_count_memset
    	c0145c60 t __constant_c_and_count_memset
    	... many more copies of this function ...
    
    Fixed by including <compiler.h> early enough.

    On OSB4 the hwif->ultra_mask is set to not support UDMA.
    Unfortunately in that case svwks_config_drive_xfer_rate()
    falls through to the end of the function, instead of trying
    other DMA modes.

    [PATCH] task_struct alignment fix
    
    The recent slab alignment changes broke an unknown number of architectures
    (parisc and x86_64 for sure) by causing task_structs to be insufficiently
    aligned.
    
    We need good alignemnt because architectures do things like dumping FP state
    into the task_struct with instructions which require particular alignment (I
    think).
    
    So change the default alignment to L1_CACHE_BYTES, which is what we used to
    have, via SLAB_HW_CACHE_ALIGN.

    [PATCH] writeback livelock fix
    
    To avoid various livelocks, the writeback code parks all the dirty inodes onto
    sb->s_io and then works through that list until it is empty.  This assumes
    that each inode will be moved to some other list as it is processed.
    
    But there's a loophole: if the ->writepages() implementation does nothing at
    all, the inode is not redirtied (which would move it to s_dirty).  This causes
    s_io to not empty and pdflush goes nuts.
    
    So when this happens, move the inode onto s_dirty within

    [PATCH] Fix might_sleep in /proc/swaps code
    
    This fixes a locking problem noted by Tim Hockin:
        * /proc/swaps uses seq_file code, calling seq_path() with swaplock held
        * seq_path() calls d_path()
        * d_path() calls mntput() which might_sleep()
    
    We add a new semaphore protecting insertions/removals in the set of swap
    components + switch of ->start()/->stop() to the same semaphore [fixes
    deadlocks] + trivial cleanup of ->next().

    [PATCH] Fix overeager stack-expansion on ppc64
    
    This fix is from Paul Mackerras and was applied in 2.4 sometime late
    last year.
    
    On ppc64, touching addresses between the highest other mapping and the
    stack can cause the stack to be extended way, way down, rather than
    causing a SEGV as you would expect.  This patch only allows the stack
    mapping to be extended to cover addresses actually within the stack
    (as determined by looking at the process's r1).  This fix is ported
    from 2.4
    
    This fixes failures on the LTP's shmdt01, munmap01 and munmap02 tests.

    [PATCH] fix default IDE interfaces initialization for PPC32
    
    In ide_init_default_irq() patch I overlooked that ppc_ide_md.init_hwif_ports()
    called from generic ide_init_hwif_ports() can set hwif->irq and it will
    be overwritten by ide_init_default_irq() if CONFIG_PCI is defined.  Fix
    it.
    
    I will clean it up properly later after killing ide_init_hwif_ports() on
    ARM{26}.  Doing it now is just wasted effort.

    [PATCH] Fix rwsem contention case on alpha/s390x
    
    Thanks to Dru <andru@treshna.com>, who provided an easy way to reproduce
    the problem.
    
    What we have in lib/rwsem.c:__rwsem_do_wake():
    	int woken, loop;
    	^^^
    and several lines below:
    	loop = woken;
    	woken *= RWSEM_ACTIVE_BIAS-RWSEM_WAITING_BIAS;
    	woken -= RWSEM_ACTIVE_BIAS;
    
    However, rw_semaphore->count is 64-bit on Alpha, so
    RWSEM_WAITING_BIAS has been defined as -0x0000000100000000L.
    Obviously, this blows up in the write contention case.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Update Motorola PrPMC750 support
    
    From: Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
    
    This patch updates support for the Motorola PrPMC750 platform.  Most of the
    size in this patch comes from merging prpmc750_pci.c and prpmc750_setup.c into
    just prpmc750.c.

    From: Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
    
    This patch adds openpic_hookup_cascade(offset, name, handler) which allows for
    an arbitrary interrupt controller to be hooked up as a cascade to the openpic.
     This also allows for platforms to just not have a cascaded controller.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Set memory-only nodes online
    
    From: Olof Johansson <olof@austin.ibm.com>
    
    On pSeries LPARs we might end up with NUMA nodes that only have memory and
    no CPUs.  Only the CPU configuration code actually set a node online, so
    memory-only nodes wouldn't show up in sysfs.  Below patch adds the
    set_online call to the memory loop too.

    The function tcp_send_skb is only called from tcp_fin, and is always called

    to send right now can be removed.  Because it always queues, change the
    name as well, and fix up the comment.

    [PATCH] fix SG_IO page leak
    
    We cannot always rely on ->biotail remaining untouched. Currently we
    leak all the pinned user pages when doing cdda ripping at least, so I
    see no way around keeping the bio pointer seperate and passing it back
    in for unmap. Alternatively, we could invent a struct blk_map_data and
    put it on the stack for passing to both map and unmap.

    [PATCH] kbuild: Improved external module support
    
    From: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>
    
    The external module support recently introduced caused a number of problems:
    - To build an external module the Module.symvers file was needed
    - To create the Module.symvers file a module was required
    - If Module.symvers was missing kbuild boiled out with an error
    - If vmlinux was missing also the stage 2 of module build failed (make -k)
    - It was not documented what was needed to actually bauild a module
    
    The following patch addresses this by adding the following functionality:
    - Always generate the Module.symvers file
    - Ignore a missing Module.symvers file
    - Add a new target modules_prepare, it prepares the kernel for building
      external modules, and is also usefull with O=
    - And it adds some more comments to Makefile.modpost, so others may follow
      it with some luck
    - .modpost.cmd is no longer generated
    
    This should close all reports on issues with respect to building external
    modules with current kernel - which has been identified as kernel problems.

    [PATCH] SELinux ptrace race fix
    
    From: Stephen Smalley <sds@epoch.ncsc.mil>
    
    Looking again at the SELinux ptrace check, I believe that there is an
    unrelated race due to the fact that the parent link is only updated after
    releasing the task lock in ptrace_attach (and this is necessary as task lock
    doesn't nest with write lock of tasklist_lock).
    
    The patch below changes SELinux to save the tracing process' SID upon a
    successful selinux_ptrace hook call and then use that SID in the ptrace check
    in apply_creds in order to avoid such races.  This allows us to preserve the
    fine-grained process-to-process ptrace check upon exec (vs.  the global
    CAP_SYS_PTRACE privilege => PT_PTRACE_CAP flag used by the capability module)
    while still avoiding races.

    [PATCH] slab: use order 0 for vfs caches
    
    We have interesting deadlocks when slab decides to use order-1 allocations for
    ext3_inode_cache.  This is because ext3_alloc_inode() needs to perform a
    GFP_NOFS 1-order allocation.
    
    Sometimes the 1-order allocation needs to free a huge number of pages (tens of
    megabytes) before a 1-order grouping becomes available.  But the GFP_NOFS
    allocator cannot free dcache (and hence icache) due to the deadlock problems
    identified in shrink_dcache_memory().
    
    So change slab so that it will force 0-order allocations for shrinkable VFS
    objects.  We can handle those OK.

    - dummy() used for reading write-only sysfs files should return -ENODEV to
      indicate failure, not 0.
    
    - efivar_create() should return the number of bytes written on success, not
      zero.
    
    - efivar_delete() should return the number of bytes written on success, not
      zero.

    that were pointed out.  The patches are broken down as follows:
    
    1 - remove all traces of efivars from arch/ia64/
    2 - add new sysfs based efivars driver into
        drivers/firmware with accompanying Kconfig/Makefile
        changes to make it fully functional for ia64 again.
    3 - cleans up x86 references to the /proc version of
        the efivars driver.

    [PATCH] slab alignment fixes
    
    From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
    
    Below is a patch that redefines the kmem_cache_alloc `align' argument:
    
    - align not zero: use the specified alignment.  I think values smaller than
      sizeof(void*) will work, even on archs with strict alignment requirement (or
      at least: slab shouldn't crash.  Obviously the user must handle the
      alignment properly).
    
    - align zero:
    * debug on: align to sizeof(void*)
    * debug off, SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN clear: align to sizeof(void*)
    * debug off, SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN set: align to the smaller of
       - cache_line_size()
       - the object size, rounded up to the next power of two.
      Slab never honored cache align for tiny objects: otherwise the 32-byte
      kmalloc objects would use 128 byte objects.
    
    There is one additional point: right now slab uses ints for the bufctls.
    Using short would save two bytes for each object.  Initially I had used short,
    but davem objected.  IIRC because some archs do not handle short efficiently.
    Should I allow arch overrides for the bufctls?  On i386, saving two bytes
    might allow a few additional anon_vma objects in each page.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Move Initrd
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    This patch moves the initrd when "make_room" runs out of space, rather than
    stepping over it.  The problem with stepping over it is that it gets copied
    with the kernel when this happens, which wastes space.
    
    Also ensures that the initrd isn't where the kernel wants to be moved to: if
    it is, it gets moved out the way.

    3) Add more debugging under DEBUG_PROM in case we broke anything.

    [PATCH] ppc64: make_room macro for ppc64 prom.c
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    copy_device_tree calls inspect_node() which recurses to copy the Open Firmware
    device tree.  It just copied into memory above the kernel for about 8MB, which
    can overwrite the initrd, and/or get truncated on big machines.
    
    The real solution is to allocate memory properly for all the prom_init memory
    users.  However, that's quite a change.  This patch introduces a "make_room"
    macro which inspect_node uses to get memory.  This does the same as before,
    except skips over the initrd if neccessary.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Make finish_device_tree use lmb_alloc, not klimit
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    finish_device_tree simply allocates nodes by incrementing klimit (ie.  using
    memory on top of the kernel).  Change it to figure out how much memory it
    needs, then use lmb_alloc to allocate that, then fill it in.
    
    This gets rid of the only manipulation of klimit after prom_init.

    [PATCH] dquot: remove unneeded test
    
    We're testing the nullness of `sb' potentially after rereferencing it
    (although the compiler will have reordered things to avoid such a bug).
    
    Just remove the test - the superblock pointer shouldn't be null in there.

    [PATCH] Per-sb dquot dirty lists
    
    From: Jan Kara <jack@ucw.cz>
    
    When there are lots of dirty dquots the vfs_quota_sync() is too slow (it has
    O(N^2) behaviour).  Attached patch implements list of dirty dquots for each
    superblock and quota type.  Using this lists sync is trivially linear.
    Attached patch is against 2.6.5 with journalled quota and previous patch for
    hash table size.
    
    (Jan had a test which went from 8 minutes to 0.8 seconds...)

    [PATCH] Bigger quota hashtable
    
    From: Jan Kara <jack@ucw.cz>
    
    I found out that quota uses hash table with just 43 entries to hash dquot
    entries.  I guess that we can afford using one page for that
    (quotactl(Q_GETQUOTA...), got faster like 3x for 4000 users).  Attached patch
    implements that.

    [PATCH] credentials locking fix
    
    From: Chris Wright <chrisw@osdl.org>
    
    Contributions from:
    Stephen Smalley <sds@epoch.ncsc.mil>
    Andy Lutomirski <luto@stanford.edu>
    
    During exec the LSM bprm_apply_creds() hooks may tranisition the program to a
    new security context (like setuid binaries).  The security context of the new
    task is dependent on state such as if the task is being ptraced.
    
    ptrace_detach() doesn't take the task_lock() when clearing task->ptrace.  So
    there is a race possible where a process starts off being ptraced, the
    malicious ptracer detaches and if any checks agains task->ptrace are done more
    than once, the results are indeterminate.
    
    This patch ensures task_lock() is held while bprm_apply_creds() hooks are
    called, keeping it safe against ptrace_attach() races.  Additionally, tests
    against task->ptrace (and ->fs->count, ->files->count and ->sighand->count all
    of which signify potential unsafe resource sharing during a security context
    transition) are done only once the results are passed down to hooks, making it
    safe against ptrace_detach() races.
    
    Additionally:
    
    - s/must_must_not_trace_exec/unsafe_exec/
    - move unsafe_exec() call above security_bprm_apply_creds() call rather than
      in call for readability.
    - fix dummy hook to honor the case where root is ptracing
    - couple minor formatting/spelling fixes

    [PATCH] Use workqueue for call_usermodehelper
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    call_usermodehelper uses keventd to create a thread, guaranteeing a nice,
    clean kernel thread.  Unfortunately, there is a case where
    call_usermodehelper is called with &bus->subsys.rwsem held (via
    bus_add_driver()), but keventd could be running bus_add_device(), which is
    blocked on the same lock.  The result is deadlock, and it comes from using
    keventd for both.
    
    In this case, it can be fixed by using a completely independent thread for
    call_usermodehelper, or an independent workqueue.  Workqueues have the
    infrastructure we need, so we use one.
    
    Move EXPORT_SYMBOL while we're there, too.

    [PATCH] create singlethread_workqueue()
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    Workqueues are a great primitive for running things from user context from
    a completely clean environment.  Unfortunately, they currently insist on
    creating one thread per CPU, which is overkill for many situations, so the
    more generic keventd workqueue is used for these.  Recently deadlocks using
    keventd were demonstrated, showing that it is not suitable for all uses.
    
    1) Clean up CPU iterators.  Always a nice touch.
    
    2) Add __create_workqueue() and create_singlethread_workqueue(),
       keeping source compatibility.
    
    3) Put workqueues in workqueue list even if !CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU (means
       we need a lock to protect that list).  Now we can tell if a wq is
       single-threaded using list_empty(&wq->list).
    
    4) For single-threaded workqueues, override CPU in queue_work,
       delayed_work_timer_fn and flush_workqueue to be 0.  flush_workqueue
       now does redundant passes for single-threaded workqueues, but the
       code remains simple.
    
    5) Make create_workqueue_thread return the thread, so we can easily
       kthread_bind for multi-threaded workqueues.
    
    
    akpm fixes:
    
    - Fix up is_single_threaded() handling
    
    - single-threaded wq thread does not have "/0" appended.

    1. Added new workaround for 5705 to improve bit error rate.
    
    2. Changed to use read-modify-write to set the extended packet bit in
    tg3_phy_reset.
    
    3. Removed some phy setup code in tg3_phy_probe. All of that is already
    in the end of tg3_phy_reset. Writing to the phy during probe time may
    contend with ASF because ASF is constantly reading phy registers to
    determine the link.
    
    
    4. Removed the write to phy register 0x18 in tg3_phy_copper_begin. Not
    sure what it was for and it will overwrite that regsiter.

    [PATCH] ia64: bug w/ shared interrupts
    
    I just ran into a bug introduced by the most recent iosapic.c patch.
    The scenario is a builtin driver is up and running happily.  A module
    loads for a devices that happens to share the same interrupt vector,
    in this case a network driver.  The module calls pci_enable_device()
    as it should, which eventually lands in iosapic_enable_intr().  We
    then proceed to mask the interrupt and kill the device that's already
    running.  As a bonus, request_interrupt() doesn't fix the problem
    because we only call the startup for the interrupt handler on the
    first action attached to the interrupt.
    
    I think the best way out of this is simply to detect when an action is
    already attached to a vector and leave it alone.  This also prevents
    interrupts from moving to other cpus (on boxes w/o irq redirection)
    for no good reason.

    [PATCH] don't log drive loading failures
    
    This is an old bug that often confuses people, rightfully.
    
    For some laptop and server type cdroms, the drives advertise themselves
    as tray loading even if they are caddy-like or slot-in loaders.  This
    means they cannot insert the media on their own, and this generates a
    5/24/00 error to START_STOP_UNIT.
    
    This prevents the logging of such a failure, and also fixes the
    generation of such a bad command in case the mech type was correctly set
    by the drive.

    [PATCH] generic PCI IDE support for Toshiba Piccolo chips
    
    From: Daniel Drake <dsd@gentoo.org>
    
    Adds Toshiba chips to the list supported by the generic PCI IDE driver.
    The 2.4 tree already contained an entry for 0x1179:0x0102, this patch
    adds that entry to 2.6 as well as two new ones (0x0103 and 0x0105).
    This then allows DMA to be enabled on disks.

            static inline.

    [ARM PATCH] 1815/1: Generic DMA buffer bouncing support for ARM targets
    
    Patch from Deepak Saxena
    
    Latest (and hopefully last :) patch for generic DMA buffer bouncing.
    
    - Fixed SA1111 dma_needs_bounce
    - Added check for out of bounds buffers.
    - Made dmabounce.c directly implement dma_* API
    
    Note that I didn't do the following:
    
    #ifndef CONFIG_DMABOUNCE
    inline implementations of all functions
    #else
    extern declarations
    #endif
    
    Instead I wrapped it individual in #ifndef/#else blocks to keep the
    comments in the same area as function declarations.  IMHO this makes
    it easier for someone to go look at the comments if they need to know
    what a specific API does.

    [PATCH] e100: ICH 10/H Tx hang fix
    
    * Need to carry forward this workaround from old e100 driver to
      avoid a Tx hang on ICH systems linked at 10/Half.  Workaround
      adds a stall before each Tx command queued by issuing a NOP
      command followed by 1us delay.  Yuck!  Otherwise HW locks hard.
      (Probably needed for eepro100 also ;-).

    [ARM PATCH] 1825/1: abort on bad code generation with div64 in some cases
    
    Patch from Nicolas Pitre
    
    One case was found when the kernel is compiled with -O2 (instead of the
    default -Os).  However, all gcc-3.* versions seem to have a problem with
    this.  Instead of blacklisting them all unconditionally, better just abort
    when a bad case occurs especially since this bad case doesn't seem to
    appear with current default compiler flags.  Depends on patch #1824.

    [ARM PATCH] 1824/1: guard against gcc not respecting local variable register assignment
    
    Patch from Nicolas Pitre
    
    The recent discovery of a problem with gcc not always respecting register
    assignment for local variables to be used with inline assembly is worrisome.
    If unnoticed, such problems can cover bugs that might prove hard to find
    especially when the code is right but silently ignored.  This patch adds a
    test where needed to have the assembler confirm our register selection and
    fail the kernel build if the wrong registers are allocated.

    [PATCH] writeback livelock fix
    
    If a filesystem's ->writepage implementation repeatedly refuses to write the
    page (it keeps on redirtying it instead) (reiserfs seems to do this) then the
    writeback logic can get stuck repeately trying to write the same page.
    
    Fix that up by correctly setting wbc->pages_skipped, to tell the writeback
    logic that things aren't working out.

    [PATCH] symlink doesn't support kobj name > 20 charaters (KOBJ_NAME_LEN)
    
    Since symlink.c uses "name" field of a kobj when it calculates the
    length,  it gets a wrong value if the kobj's name  has more than 20
    charathers.  A correct way to do that is to call kobject_name(kobj)
    instead of using kobj->name directly.

    [PATCH] tipar char driver: wrong timeout value
    
    this patch (2.4 & 2.6) fixes a bug about the timeout value. The formula
    used to calculate jiffies from timeout is wrong.
    The new formula is ok and takes care of integer computation/rounding.
    There is the same bug in the tiglusb.c module which will be fixed by another
    patch.

    Most probably the patch program got confused and applied the hung at wrong

    Attached is a patch that places that 2 lines in the correct spot.

    this patch (cumulative; 2.4 & 2.6) fixes another bug in the tiglusb

    The new formula is ok and takes care of integer computation/rounding.
    This is the same kind of bug than in the tipar char driver.

    [PATCH] use smp_processor_id() in init_IRQ()
    
    This replaces current_thread_info()->cpu in i386' init_IRQ() by the
    equivalent smp_processor_id().
    
    Reduces overhead on UP, and makes the code cleaner.

    [PATCH] clean up Pentium M quirk code in nmi.c
    
    This simplifies the Pentium M quirk code in nmi.c, and eliminates an
    unnecessary apic_read().
    
    Local APIC accesses are not zero-cycle; let's not inflict more damage
    than we must.

    This patch just adds some proc entries for the virtual tape and cdrom
    drivers to allow mapping between linux devices and OS/400 ones.  This is
    expected by existing users and there is no other way to do this
    translation.

    [PATCH] USB: Important bugfix for UHCI list management code
    
    A major bug in the UHCI driver turned up recently.  Thanks to a lot of
    help from Simone Gotti it was identified and fixed late last week.  It
    turned out to be entirely my fault -- a previous patch had introduced two
    (!) errors.  (A combination of carelessness and a nasty thinko, and
    somehow it passed the regression tests...)
    
    Anyway, it's entirely possible that many of the problems people have been
    seeing are caused by that bug.  This patch is the solution.

    [PATCH] pcmcia netdev ordering fixes
    
    From: Russell King <rmk+pcmcia@arm.linux.org.uk>
    
    This is an *untested* patch (PCMCIA people, please test) to fix
    initialisation ordering issues in these network device drivers.  I don't
    have the hardware to be able to test these changes, although it passes a
    modular build without warnings.
    
    Andrew - it may be worth sticking these in -mm so they get some visibility
    via your tree as well.
    
    Many of these drivers were calling register_netdev() before they had
    completed their initialisation.
    
    In addition, they were calling register_netdev with the
    "DEV_CONFIG_PENDING" flag still set, which prevents hotplug scripts from
    bringing up the interface.
    
    Also, we take care to ensure that link->dev is correctly set - this is used
    to tell the PCMCIA release code if the netdev is currently registered (yes,
    that's probably racy at present, but lets sort one problem at a time.)
    
    I've arranged that all drivers register the netdevice as close as possible
    to the end of their initialisation, copy the net device's name for cardmgr
    to pass to it's network scripts, and then print out whatever information
    the driver wants to.
    
    Finally, a note about ibmtr - it seemed to assume that cardmgr wanted "tr0"
    or "tr1" depending on the base address, and completely ignoring the real
    device which the netdev layer allocated it.  I've assumed that this is
    wrong (since the netdev name is used in printk messages), and changed it to
    behave the same as the other drivers.

    [PATCH] atmel wireless update
    
    Fixes to avoid problems when the driver shares an interrupt. These were
    caused because the ISR cannot determine the status of the chip without
    changing its state and the driver was only disabling the interrupts from
    the card during some critical regions. An interrupt originating from
    another device at the wrong moment could run the ISR and corrupt chip
    state. Fixed by blocking interupts in the processor in critical regions
    and never checking the chip interrupt status before the driver is fully
    up.
    
    
    Added the ability to override the Regulatory Domain stored in ROM. The
    following command achieves this
    
    iwpriv <interface> regdomain <domain>
    
    vaild domains are USA,Canada,Europe,Spain,France,MKK,MKK1,Israel
    
    The current regulatory domain affects which radio channels are available
    for use.
    
    
    Some minor tidying to calibrate busy-wait loops using udelay and remove
    inclusion of obsolete include/linux/802_11.h

    [PATCH] removal of MOD_{INC,DEC}_USE_COUNT in ide-cs.c
    
    From: Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>
    
    The "ide-cs" module cannot be unloaded because it uses obsolete
    MOD_INC_USE_COUNT and MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT macros.  In fact, they are not
    needed in ide-cs.c in 2.6 kernels.  The generic PCMCIA code already
    increases use count for every device served by the driver, so it's
    impossible to unload the ide-cs driver while it's in use.
    
    I was told that the removal of IDE interfaces may be unsafe in 2.6
    kernels.  However, MOD_INC_USE_COUNT only prevents removal of the module,
    not the interface.  It's also the first obstacle, albeit a trivial one,
    for anybody debugging those problems (i.e. loading a modified module
    requires "rmmod -f" or reboot to unload the old version).

    doesn't try to remove that directory again.

    [PATCH] loop_set_fd() sendfile check fix
    
    From: Yury Umanets <torque@ukrpost.net>
    
    I have found small inconsistency in loop_set_fd().  It checks if
    ->sendfile() is implemented for passed block device file.  But in fact,
    loop back device driver never calls it.  It uses ->sendfile() from backing
    store file.

    [PATCH] i386 hugetlb tlb correction
    
    From: William Lee Irwin III <wli@holomorphy.com>
    
    i386 does hardware interpretation of pagetables, so pte_clear() can't be
    used on present ptes, as it sets the upper half of the hugepte prior to
    setting the lower half (which includes the valid bit).  i.e.  there is a
    window where having a hugepage mapped at 56GB and doing pte_clear() in
    unmap_hugepage_range() allows other threads of the process to see a
    hugepage at 0 in place of the original hugepage at 56GB.
    
    This patch corrects the situation by using ptep_get_and_clear(), which
    clears the lower word of the pte prior to clearing the upper word.
    
    There is another nasty where huge_page_release() needs to wait for TLB
    flushes before returning the hugepages to the free pool, analogous to the
    issue tlb_remove_page() and tlb_flush_mm() repair.

    [PATCH] selinux: remove hardcoded policy assumption from get_user_sids() logic
    
    From: Stephen Smalley <sds@epoch.ncsc.mil>
    
    This patch removes a hardcoded policy assumption from the get_user_sids logic
    in the SELinux module that was preventing it from returning contexts that had
    the same type as the caller even if the policy allowed such a transition.  The
    assumption is not valid for all policies, and can be handled via policy
    configuration and userspace rather than hardcoding it in the module logic.

    [PATCH] selinux: add runtime disable
    
    From: Stephen Smalley <sds@epoch.ncsc.mil>
    
    This patch adds a kernel configuration option that enables writing to a new
    selinuxfs node 'disable' that allows SELinux to be disabled at runtime prior
    to initial policy load.  SELinux will then remain disabled until next boot.
    This option is similar to the selinux=0 boot parameter, but is to support
    runtime disabling of SELinux, e.g.  from /sbin/init, for portability across
    platforms where boot parameters are difficult to employ (based on feedback by
    Jeremy Katz).

    [PATCH] selinux: change context_to_sid handling for no-policy case
    
    From: Stephen Smalley <sds@epoch.ncsc.mil>
    
    This patch changes the behavior of security_context_to_sid in the no-policy
    case so that it simply accepts all contexts and maps them to the kernel SID
    rather than rejecting anything other than an initial SID.  The change avoids
    error conditions when using SELinux in permissive/no-policy mode, so that any
    file contexts left on disk from prior use of SELinux with a policy will not
    cause an error when they are looked up and userspace attempts to set contexts
    can succeed.

    Remove all the code now in the VFS, make XFS's freeze ioctls use the new

    This code needs some work so the source files shared with 2.4 aren't
    exposed to the new VFS interfaces directly.  You'll get an update once this
    has been discussed with the other XFS developers and is implemented.  Note

    [PATCH] lockfs - vfs bits
    
    From: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>
    
    These are the generic lockfs bits.  Basically it takes the XFS freezing
    statemachine into the VFS.  It's all behind the kernel-doc documented
    freeze_bdev and thaw_bdev interfaces.
    
    Based on an older patch from Chris Mason.

    We've had trouble with this driver, it appears to work but the hardware
    never does the final reboot.  I have yet to come across someone with a
    board which works and don't have personal access to one.  So how about
    scrapping the whole thing.

    [PATCH] Call populate_rootfs later in boot
    
    populate_rootfs() is called rather early - before we've called init_idle().
    
    But populate_rootfs() does file I/O, which involves calls to cond_resched(),
    and downing of semaphores, etc.  If it scheules, the scheduler emits
    scheduling-while-atomic warnings and sometimes oopses.
    
    So run populate_rootfs() later, after the scheduler is all set up.

    [PATCH] ext3 avoid writing kernel memory to disk
    
    From: Marc-Christian Petersen <m.c.p@kernel.linux-systeme.com>
    
    Solar Designer discovered an information leak in the ext3 code of Linux.
    In a worst case an attacker could read sensitive data such as cryptographic
    keys which would otherwise never hit disk media.  Theodore Ts'o developed a
    correction for this.

    [PATCH] compute_creds race
    
    From: Andy Lutomirski <luto@myrealbox.com>
    
    Fixes from me, Olaf Dietsche <olaf+list.linux-kernel@olafdietsche.de>
    
    In fs/exec.c, compute_creds does:
    
    	task_lock(current);
    	if (bprm->e_uid != current->uid || bprm->e_gid != current->gid) {
                     current->mm->dumpable = 0;
    
    		if (must_not_trace_exec(current)
    		    || atomic_read(&current->fs->count) > 1
    		    || atomic_read(&current->files->count) > 1
    		    || atomic_read(&current->sighand->count) > 1) {
    			if(!capable(CAP_SETUID)) {
    				bprm->e_uid = current->uid;
    				bprm->e_gid = current->gid;
    			}
    		}
    	}
    
             current->suid = current->euid = current->fsuid = bprm->e_uid;
             current->sgid = current->egid = current->fsgid = bprm->e_gid;
    
    	task_unlock(current);
    
    	security_bprm_compute_creds(bprm);
    
    I assume the task_lock is to prevent another process (on SMP or preempt)
    from ptracing the execing process between the check and the assignment.  If
    that's the concern then the fact that the lock is dropped before the call
    to security_brpm_compute_creds means that, if security_bprm_compute_creds
    does anything interesting, there's a race.
    
    For my (nearly complete) caps patch, I obviously need to fix this.  But I
    think it may be exploitable now.  Suppose there are two processes, A (the
    malicious code) and B (which uses exec).  B starts out unprivileged (A and
    B have, e.g., uid and euid = 500).
    
    1. A ptraces B.
    
    2. B calls exec on some setuid-root program.
    
    3. in cap_bprm_set_security, B sets bprm->cap_permitted to the full
       set.
    
    4. B gets to compute_creds in exec.c, calls task_lock, and does not
       change its uid.
    
    5. B calls task_unlock.
    
    6. A detaches from B (on preempt or SMP).
    
    7. B gets to task_lock in cap_bprm_compute_creds, changes its
       capabilities, and returns from compute_creds into load_elf_binary.
    
    8. load_elf_binary calls create_elf_tables (line 852 in 2.6.5-mm1),
       which calls cap_bprm_secureexec (through LSM), which returns false (!).
    
    9. exec finishes.
    
    The setuid program is now running with uid=euid=500 but full permitted
    capabilities.  There are two (or three) ways to effectively get local root
    now:
    
    1.  IIRC, linux 2.4 doesn't check capabilities in ptrace, so A could
       just ptrace B again.
    
    2. LD_PRELOAD.
    
    3.  There are probably programs that will misbehave on their own under
       these circumstances.
    
    Is there some reason why this is not doable?
    
    The patch renames bprm_compute_creds to bprm_apply_creds and moves all uid
    logic into the hook, where the test and the resulting modification can both
    happen under task_lock().
    
    This way, out-of-tree LSMs will fail to compile instead of malfunctioning.
    It should also make life easier for LSMs and will certainly make it easier
    for me to finish the cap patch.

    [PATCH] fix for potential deadlock after posix-timers change
    
    Ulrich has been working on the glibc code using posix-timers and
    stressing it more now than it has before.  He ran into an SMP deadlock
    on process exit in the case there are pending queued signals from a
    timer.
    
    The deadlock arises because in the path through exit_itimers, the
    tasklist_lock is already held (for writing).  When a timer is being
    deleted, sigqueue_free will try to take it (for reading) in the case
    where that timer has a pending signal queued on somebody's queue.  This
    patch avoids the problem by making sure the queues are flushed before
    calling exit_itimers, thus ensuring its code path won't try to take
    tasklist_lock.

    [PATCH] ppc64: siginfo conversion fix
    
    My message queue patch fixes the 64 bits -> 32 bits conversion of
    siginfo, but didn't change the 32 -> 64 bits conversion done in
    sys32_rt_sigqueueinfo() which was apparently bogus as well.
    
    After much discussion & debate on the right way of converting that
    structure, I decided to go the sparc64 / s390 way, and not the x86_64
    way, that is to copy the various unions data "as is". This guarantees
    that whatever a 32 bist app passes there, another 32 bits app will
    understand it. Crossover between 32 and 64 bits apps on such things
    as home-made userland siginfo isn't something we can help with anyway.
    
    The x86_64 choice of converting as if it was an RT signal, thus
    converting the sigval, cannot easily be applied to big endian archs
    since the sigval is a union of a ptr and an int, on BE, the int
    happens to be on the wrong half of the 64 bits ptr, thus  we can't
    do a simple conversion.

    [PATCH] Fix hw_random build on ia64
    
    The following patch allows hw_random.c to build on ia64.  (The problem
    was just that the VIA stuff has i386 assembly in it.  The current code
    only probes for VIA on i386 anyway, so this patch just adds more ifdefs
    so the VIA code is only built for i386.)

    [PATCH] Tulip endianess fix
    
    My tulip ethernet card doesn't work on Blue&White G3 PowerMac with Linux
    2.6.5-rc2.  The card is shown by lspci as
    
    01:03.0 Ethernet controller: Linksys Network Everywhere Fast Ethernet
    10/100 model NC100 (rev 11)
    
    The kernel detects it as "ADMtek Comet rev 17".
    
    The MAC address reported by the kernel looked obviously wrong.  Also, I
    could only ping the system successfully if the interface was in promiscuous
    mode (running Ethereal).
    
    Those two symptoms indicated two different problems - one for reading the
    MAC address from the card on module load (tulip_init_one), and the other
    for writing the address to the card when the interface was brought up
    (tulip_up).  I have fixed both, and here's the explanation:
    
    tulip_init_one:
    
    When reading the first 4 bytes of the address, inl() returns the same data
    to the CPU on all platforms, interpreting the data from the lowest port
    address as the least significant byte.  In other words, I/O is little
    endian on all platforms; it's the memory that differs across platforms.
    We want to write the data to memory preserving little-endianness of the
    PCI bus.  To force little endian write to the memory, the data should be
    converted to the little endian format.
    
    When reading the remaining 2 bytes, the CPU gets them in 2 least
    significant bytes.  To write those 2 bytes to the memory in a 16-bit
    operation, they should be byte-swapped for the 16-bit operation.
    
    tulip_up:
    
    The first 4 bytes are processed correctly, but the code is confusing.
    Reading from memory needs conversion to CPU format, while writing to I/O
    ports doesn't.  So I replaced cpu_to_le32() to le32_to_cpu().
    
    The second 2 bytes are read in a 16-bit memory operation, so they should
    be passed to le16_to_cpu() rather than cpu_to_le32() to make them CPU
    independent and suitable for outl().
    
    
    All those conversions do nothing on little-endian machines, so they should
    not be affected.
    
    The patch has been tested.  The driver is working fine.  ping is OK, ssh
    is OK, X11 over ssh is OK.  Even netconsole is working fine.

    I didn't particularly like the PRIV() method implemented previously -
    gcc appears to want to avoid some optimisations it if its an inline
    function rather than a macro.
    
    Also, 'ei_local' may look unused in some functions, but it's your
    typical hidden-use-in-a-macro crap which 8390 likes.

    [PATCH] Mixed PCI/ISA device name conflicts
    
    In systems with mixed network cards, and all drivers compiled into
    the kernel; the PCI device (eth0) will get probed first, before the ISA.
    
    The problem is that the ISA device can mistakenly try to probe
    for eth0.  The problem is that the ISA driver will not detect the failure
    until it goes to call register_netdevice, and not all drivers have
    perfect error unwind code.
    
    This patch short circuits the device probe, so it won't bother
    looking for devices that already are registered.

    Looks like a bug.  Possible patch below zeros the buffer (since it's not
    filled completely by e1000_ethtool_gregs()), and truncates len.

    [PATCH] remove redundant check in de2104x ->get_regs()
    
    Trivial patchlet...ethtool core already caps regs.len at a max of
    ->get_regs_len():
    
    	reglen = ops->get_regs_len(dev);
    	if (regs.len > reglen)
    		regs.len = reglen;
    
    So doing the same in the in de2104x driver ->get_regs() is redundant.
    Patch below simply removes it to clarify the guarantee of the API.

    Hrm, I believe you could use this to read 128k of kernel memory.
    sdla_read() takes len as a short, whereas mem.len is an int.  So,
    if mem.len == 0x20000, the allocation could still succeed.  When cast
    to short, len will be 0x0, causing the read loop to copy nothing into
    the buffer.  At least it's protected by a capable() check.  I don't
    know what proper upper bound is for this hardware, or how much it's
    used/cared about.  Simple memset() is trivial fix.

    [PATCH] From: David Gibson <david@gibson.dropbear.id.au>
    
    hugepage_vma() is both misleadingly named and unnecessary.  On most archs it
    always returns NULL, and on IA64 the vma it returns is never used.  The
    function's real purpose is to determine whether the address it is passed is a
    special hugepage address which must be looked up in hugepage pagetables,
    rather than being looked up in the normal pagetables (which might have
    specially marked hugepage PMDs or PTEs).
    
    This patch kills off hugepage_vma() and folds the logic it really needs into
    follow_huge_addr().  That now returns a (page *) if called on a special
    hugepage address, and an error encoded with ERR_PTR otherwise.  This also
    requires tweaking the IA64 code to check that the hugepage PTE is present in
    follow_huge_addr() - previously this was guaranteed, since it was only called
    if the address was in an existing hugepage VMA, and hugepages are always
    prefaulted.

    [PATCH] Fix default value for commit interval for older reiserfs filesystems.
    
    From: Bart Samwel <bart@samwel.tk>
    
    The reiserfs patch that adds support for "commit=0" saves the default max
    commit age in a variable when the fs is originally mounted, so that it can
    later restore it.  Unfortunately it makes some mistakes with that:
    
    - The default is not saved when the original mount has a commit=NNN option.
    
    - The default is not correctly saved for older reiserfs filesystems, where
      the default was not stored on disk.
    
    This patch fixes these mistakes.

    [PATCH] Increase number of dynamic inodes in procfs
    
    From: Nathan Lynch <nathanl@austin.ibm.com>
    
    On some larger ppc64 configurations /proc/device-tree is exhausting procfs'
    dynamic (non-pid) inode range (16K).  This patch makes the dynamic inode
    range 0xf0000000-0xffffffff and changes the inode number allocator to use
    the idr.c allocator for the first-fit allocations.

    [PATCH] Rename PF_IOTHREAD to PF_NOFREEZE
    
    From: Nigel Cunningham <ncunningham@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    A few weeks ago, Pavel and I agreed that PF_IOTHREAD should be renamed to
    PF_NOFREEZE.  This reflects the fact that some threads so marked aren't
    actually used for IO while suspending, but simply shouldn't be frozen.
    This patch, against 2.6.5 vanilla, applies that change.  In the
    refrigerator calls, the actual value doesn't matter (so long as it's
    non-zero) and it makes more sense to use PF_FREEZE so I've used that.

    [PATCH] rmap: nonlinear truncation
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    The earlier changes introducing PageAnon left truncated pages mapped into
    nonlinear vmas unswappable.  Once we go to object-based rmap, it's
    impossible to find where file page is mapped once page->mapping cleared:
    switching them to anonymous is odd, and breaks strict commit accounting.
    
    So now handle truncation of nonlinear vmas correctly.  And factor in
    Daniel's cluster filesystem needs while we're there: when invalidating
    local cache, we do want to unmap shared pages from all mms, but we do not
    want to discard private COWed modifications of those pages (which
    truncation discards to satisfy the SIGBUS semantics demanded by specs).
    
    Drew from Daniel's patch (LKML 2 Mar 04), but didn't always follow it;
    fewer name changes, but still some - "unmap" rather than "invalidate".
    zap_page_range is not exported, safe to give it and all the too-many layers
    an extra zap_details arg, in normal cases just NULL.
    
    Given details, zap_pte_range checks page mapping or index to skip anon or
    untruncated pages.  I didn't realize before implementing, that in nonlinear
    case, it should set a file pte when truncating - otherwise linear pages
    might appear in place of SIGBUS.  I suspect this implies that ->populate
    functions ought to set file ptes beyond EOF instead of failing, but haven't
    changed them as yet.
    
    To avoid making yet another copy of that ugly linear pgidx test, added
    inline function linear_page_index (to pagemap.h to get PAGE_CACHE_SIZE,
    though as usual things don't really work if it differs from PAGE_SIZE).
    Ooh, I thought I'd removed ___add_to_page_cache last time, do so now.
    
    unmap_page_range static, shift its hugepage check up into sole caller
    unmap_vmas.  Killed "killme" debug from unmap_vmas, not seen it trigger.
    unmap_mapping_range is exported without restriction: I'm one of those who
    believe it should be generally available.  But I'm wrongly placed to decide
    that, probably just sob quietly to myself if _GPL added later.

    [PATCH] rmap: swap_unplug page
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    Good example of "swapper_space considered harmful": swap_unplug_io_fn was
    originally designed for calling via swapper_space.backing_dev_info; but
    that way it loses track of which device is to be unplugged, so had to
    unplug all swap devices.  But now sync_page tests SwapCache anyway, can
    call swap_unplug_io_fn with page, which leads direct to the device.
    
    Reverted -mc4's CONFIG_SWAP=n fix, just add another NOTHING for it.
    Reverted -mc3's editorial adjustments to swap_backing_dev_info and
    swapper_space initializations: they document the few fields which are
    actually used now, as comment above them says (sound of slapped wrist).

    [PATCH] rmap: flush_dcache revisited
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    One of the callers of flush_dcache_page is do_generic_mapping_read, where
    file is read without i_sem and without page lock: concurrent truncation may
    at any moment remove page from cache, NULLing ->mapping, making
    flush_dcache_page liable to oops.  Put result of page_mapping in a local
    variable and apply mapping_mapped to that (if we were to check for NULL
    within mapping_mapped, it's unclear whether to say yes or no).
    
    parisc and arm do have other locking unsafety in their i_mmap(_shared)
    searching, but that's a larger issue to be dealt with down the line.

    My RTAS locking fixes incorrectly added a spinlock around the function used

    The correct fix is to disable interrupts instead (the RTAS params beeing
    per-CPU, this should be safe enough)

    [ARM] Add detailed documentation concerning ARM page tables
    
    This adds detailed documentation concerning how we map the Linux
    page table structure onto the hardware tables on ARM.  In addition,
    it also adds documentation describing how we emulate the "dirty"
    and "young" or "accessed" page table bits.
    
    This should be of interest to Linux MM developers.

    [PATCH] Fix vma corruption
    
    It occurred to me that if vma and new_vma are one and the same, then
    vma_relink_file will not do a good job of linking it after itself - in
    that pretty unlikely case when move_page_tables fails.
    
    And more generally, whenever copy_vma's vma_merge succeeds, we have no
    guarantee that old vma comes before new_vma in the i_mmap lists, as we
    need to satisfy Rajesh's point: that ordering is only guaranteed in the
    newly allocated case.
    
    We have to abandon the ordering method when/if we move from lists to
    prio_trees, so this patch switches to the less glamorous use of
    i_shared_sem exclusion, as in my prio_tree mremap.

    [PATCH] Remove unused 'kobject' from superblock
    
    The field in question is
      a) unused
      b) damn next to impossible to use correctly, due to struct super_block
         lifetime and locking rules.

    [PCMCIA] Conversion to module_param
    
    Patch from: Pavel Roskin
    
    As it turns out, mixing MODULE_PARM and module_param in one module is
    wrong.  The parameters specified in module_param are ignored.  I've just
    posted a patch to LKML that will detect this condition and warn about it.
    
    The new debugging code used the new-style module_param, which means that
    all instances of MODULE_PARM should be converted.  The attached patch does
    that.
    
    An additional bonus is that module_param_array provides the number of
    array elements.  This allowed me to change tcic.c and i82365.c to use
    this number for IRQ list.  This change was tested with i82365.  If
    "irq_list" is not specified, irq_list_count is 0.
    
    I set all permissions to 0444 to be safe.  I think we have no secrets
    from the users regarding those parameters.  If some parameters can be
    changed safely at the runtime, the permissions could be changed to 0644.
    I didn't examine how safe (and how useful) it would be, so it's 0444 for
    now.

    [PATCH] ARM-related ptep_to_address() fix
    
    From: William Lee Irwin III <wli@holomorphy.com>
    
    rmk mentioned that ARM was borked as the relation, assumed by generic rmap,
    PTRS_PER_PTE*sizeof(pte_t) == PAGE_SIZE, fails to hold.  The following
    patch, developed jointly with him (or depending on POV, by him with me
    acting as codemonkey), is reported to resolve the issue.
    
    Specifically, while ARM dedicates an entire PAGE_SIZE -sized block of
    memory to each PTE table, the PTE table itself only spans half that, the
    remainder being dedicated to hardware-interpreted structures.  As the
    hardware structure must be contiguous, wider ptes can't be used.  So the
    core-visible PTE table only spans PAGE_SIZE/2 bytes, violating the
    assumption.  This corrects masking and scaling done in ptep_to_address().

    From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
    
    Any user can delete any entries in a mqueue mounted filesystem.  The attached
    patch prevents that.
    
    - remove the writable test from mq_unlink.
    
    - set the sticky bit in the root inode.  This affects both mq_unlink and
      sys_unlink: only the owner (and root) should be allowed to remove queues.

    [PATCH] Fix bogus get_page() calls in hugepage code
    
    From: David Gibson <david@gibson.dropbear.id.au>
    
    Some versions of follow_huge_addr() and follow_huge_pmd() are doing a
    get_page() on the target page.  They shouldn't: follow_page() returns an
    unpinned page and it is the caller's responsibility to pin the page (if
    desired) before dropping page_table_lock.

    [PATCH] reiserfs: fsync() speedup
    
    From: Chris Mason <mason@suse.com>
    
    Updates the reiserfs-logging improvements to use schedule_timeout instead of
    yield when letting the transaction grow a little before forcing a commit for
    fsync/O_SYNC/O_DIRECT.
    
    Also, when one process forces a transaction to end and plans on doing the
    commit (like fsync), it sets a flag on the transaction so the journal code
    knows not to bother kicking the journal work queue.
    
    queue_delayed_work is used so that if we get a bunch of tiny transactions
    ended quickly, we aren't constantly kicking the work queue.
    
    These significantly improve reiserfs performance during fsync heavy
    workloads.

    normally read from the journal; this patch adds an extra variable to cache
    the default value for the maximum commit age.

    Nobody ever checks the return value of submit_bh(), and submit_bh() is the

    This changes the kernel I/O submission path -- a fast path -- so this
    cleanup is also a microoptimization.

    [PATCH] Fix exec in multithreaded application
    
    The recent controlling terminal changes broke exec from multithreaded
    application because de_thread was not upgraded to new arrangement.  I
    know that I should not have LD_PRELOAD library which automatically
    creates one thread, but it looked like a cool solution to the problem I
    had.
    
    de_thread must initialize the controlling terminal information in the
    new thread group.

    [PATCH] pcnet32 transmit performance fix
    
    When the pcnet32 adapter is installed in a system with long PCI latency
    and the read burst bit is not set, performance on transmission is very
    low (under 20Mbit on a 100Mbit link).  This patch against 2.6.6-rc1 will
    make sure that read and write bursts are enabled.  Tested on ppc64 and
    ia32.

    [ARM] Add --no-undefined to linker command line.
    
    Many binutils versions over the last year appear to silently build
    assembler files with undefined constants, and able to successfully
    create executables from such files.  The assembler appears to add
    undefined symbols to the symbol table without any corresponding
    relocation information.  Obviously this is bad news since the
    resulting executable may not be what the programmer intended.
    Work around the problem by forcing the linker to fail if there are
    any undefined symbols in the final object(s).

    [PATCH] remount: mount flags filtering
    
     - we could pass MS_ACTIVE in mount flags and it would be passed into
       ->get_sb(), leading to interesting failure modes.  This flag is only
       for internal use (it's set once fill_super is complete and reset
       before the inode eviction on umount); made sure that we never get
       tricked into having it set it too early.

       with that.  Fixed, ACKed by maintainer.

    [PATCH] remount: fs/sysv fixes
    
     - several variants of sysv fs are supported only r/o.  Driver does
       force r/o on mount, but doesn't do anything on remount.  As the
       result, one can remount them r/w and results are Not Pretty(tm).
       Missing checks added, code cleaned up.
    
     - we had double-brelse() in v7fs - if sanity checks on root inode will
       succeed, but allocation of root dentry fails, we brelse() the same
       buffer_head twice.  Fixed.

    [BRIDGE]: Use ethtool to get port speed.
    
    The bridge code needs to keep track of a cost estimate for each
    port in the bridge.  Instead of a hack based on device name, try
    and use ethtool to get port speed from device.  This has been tested
    on e100 (uses ethtool_ops) and e1000 (does ethtool the hard way)
    and dummy (no ethtool).
    
    Need to export dev_ethtool() to allow bridge module to get to
    it easily.
    
    Code takes care to maintain same locking and semantics as if ioctl
    was being done from application.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix RTAS races on pSeries
    
    The low level kernel interface to RTAS (the firmware runtime services)
    was plagued with races that could cause from bogus results of RTAS
    operations to total machine crashes in some circumstances. This patch
    fix the ones I could identify, hoping I didn't miss any. I also added
    a WARN_ON (well, it's asm equivalent) to enter_rtas to make sure we
    never _ever_ try to call that with interrupts enabled.

    [PATCH] ppc64: catch branch to 0 in real mode
    
    We have been debugging some strange fails where we branch to 0 in real
    mode. At the moment this results in the cpu running through the
    initialisation code and failing somewhere well into it.
    
    The following patch uses the featuring nop'ing code to remove the branch
    at real address 0 so it falls through to a trap instruction and gets
    caught early.

    [PATCH] NMI watchdog Pentium M support
    
    This adda nmi_watchdog=2 support to the Pentium M processor.  The P-M is
    a P6 chip, but it shares some chipset logic with the Pentium 4, so it
    requires this workaround to function.
    
    Without this patch, NMI gets stuck after 1 count.  With it, the NMI
    fires and breaks me out of UHCI-related hard lockups.
    
    This patch is basically a modified version of the same patch for
    oprofile. See the threaded discussion here:

    [PATCH] fix non-PC subarchs which were broken by i386 probe_roms change
    
    The author apparently didn't understand that only the mach-default
    include directory is included by fallback for header files only.  You
    can't stick a .c file in mach-default and expect all subarchs to be able
    to use it.
    
    The correct fix is to put std_resources.c in the kernel directory and
    give it its own Kconfig symbol for conditional compile so that subarchs
    may choose to include it or not.

    [PATCH] fix 4k irqstacks on x86 (and add voyager support)
    
    There's a bug in the x86 code in that it sets the boot CPU to zero.
    
    This isn't correct since some subarch's use physically indexed CPUs.
    However, subarchs have either set the boot cpu before irq_INIT() (or
    just inherited the default zero from INIT_THREAD_INFO()), so it's safe
    to believe current_thread_info()->cpu about the boot cpu.

    This adds IOMMU support & IOMU virtual merging to the default g5 config.

    (the kernel will only enable it if you have more than 2Gb of RAM, though
    you can explicitely enable it using a command line argument).

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix possible duplicate MMU hash entries
    
    The current code has a subtle race where 2 hash PTEs can be inserted
    for the same virtual address for a short period of time. There should
    not be a stale one as the "old" one ultimately gets flushed, but the
    architecture specifies that having two hash PTE is illegal and can
    result in undefined behaviour.
    
    This patch fixes it by never clearing the _PAGE_HASHPTE bit when
    doing test_and_clear_{young,dirty}. That means that subsequent faults
    on those pages will have a bit more overhead to "discover" that the
    hash entry was indeed evicted.
    
    It also adds a small optisation to avoid doing the atomic operation
    and the hash flush in test_and_clear_dirty when the page isn't dirty
    or when setting write protect while it's already set.

    [PATCH] ext3: journalled quotas
    
    From: Jan Kara <jack@ucw.cz>
    
    Journalled quota support for ext3: The patch consists of two parts - ext3
    changes and changes in generic quota code.  The main idea of the changes is
    that a transaction is always started before any operation which changes quota
    file and dirtifying of the quota causes its write to disk.  These two changes
    assure that quota change is journalled into the same transaction as the file
    change and hence after journal replay quota is consistent with the filesystem
    state.  As during journal replay inodes from orphan list are deleted/truncated
    we have to do quota_on before the replay of the orphan list - this problem is
    solved by additional mount options to ext3 with quota file names and format.
    
    Some changes in generic code were also needed to assure that quota structure
    in file is always allocated and so ordinary quota operations (like
    adding/deleting a block/inode) need only a few blocks from the transaction.

    SUSv3 doesn't seem to specify one way or the other.  I don't have the POSIX
    specs, and the old docs I have suggest that mq_open() creates an object
    which is to be closed upon exec.

      I think it is valid and required:
    
        http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/functions/exec.html
    
        All open message queue descriptors in the calling process shall be
        closed, as described in mq_close()
    
      I'll add a new test for this into glibc testsuite.

    Warning: it will only half work on the ACER Aspire, though: there is
    no pstate in the DSDT corresponding to the max frequency...
    I'm looking how to handle that correctly, probably at the init stage,
    if the max frequency is not given, then add it to powernow_table.
    
    * Integrate acpi perflib from Dominik.
    * Use acpi if the PST tables are known to be broken (ASUS Aspire match one PST,
      but give brain damaged values), or use ACPI if no PST found.

    [CPUFREQ] Correcting SGTC.  Timer is based upon FSB
    From: Bruno Ducrot <ducrot@poupinou.org>
    
    I think this patch is needed especially if the FSB is around 166MHz or
    200MHz, or else I believe we get instabilities on some K7's motherboard
    powernow capable (it's called Cool'n Quiet IIRC).
    
    
    * Deduce fsb from cpu_khz and the max multiplier.  It will be given as kHz now,
      so that frequency associated to a multiplier will be computate more
      accurately.  Also, we need it for SGTC (see below).
    * Fix how cpuid is computed in powernow_decode_bios().
    * Be more restrictive for PST.  It may be possible (on desktop shipped with
      low power Athlon models) that FSB can be changed by dip switchs on
      motherboard for example.
    * Fix computation for SGTC.  It use the bus timer (and then the bus
      frequency given by fsb).

    [PATCH] yenta: interrupt routing for TI briges
    
    Some TI cardbus bridges found in notebooks and PCI add-on cards are
    uninitialized.  This means the interrupt mode and the interrupt routing
    is wrong in most cases, ending up in non working PCI interrupts.
    
    This makes the TI Yenta driver probe the PCI interrupt and adjust the
    interrupt setting if no interrupts are delivered.  It's done in a safe
    way, that doesn't hurt working setups.
    
    Function 1 on two slot devices is handled differently from function 0
    since both share the settings.

    Okay, now while we are at fixing security holes, is there any chance we
    can _finally_ get the attached patch in?
    
    The Vicam USB driver in all Linux Kernels 2.6 mainline does not use the
    copy_from_user function when copying data from userspace to kernel space,
    which crosses security boundaries and allows local users to cause a denial
    of service.
    
    Already ACKed by Greg. Only complaint was inproper coding style which is done
    with attached patch ;)

    The effect was that the following scenario failed:
    
    	make
    	make install
    	make modules_install
    
    The solution is to only cleanup .tmp_versions when building modules.

    [PATCH] USB: Patch for Clie TH55 Support in visor kernel module
    
    I just want to explain the changes I've made, since I tried to adhere to the
    more organized structure in the 2.6 visor module to incorporate my changes.
    
    I didn't want to pollute this with some ugly hack.
    
    I created a new device id table with name clie_id_5_table to cleanly separate
    the UX50/TH55 from the rest.
    
    Along with this I added a new usb_serial_device_type which is essentially a
    copy of handspring_device but has its own attach function.
    
    This new attach function ( clie_5_attach ) will do the actual magic.
    
    I think it is justified to introduce a new type ( which I called clie_5 )
    since I suspect that Sony is intentionally changing the interface spec ( As
    it has done so in the past ). I dare to predict that we will see more clie
    devices coming this year which will require this new attachment procedure. At
    the moment I am only aware of the UX50 and TH55 to implement that weird
    configuration.

    [PATCH] USB speedtouch: bump the version number
    
    Hi Greg, this patch bumps the speedtouch driver's version number.
    It also adds the version number to the module description, so people
    can see it with modinfo.  I also added a MODULE_VERSION line (why?
    because it was there...)  The patch is against your 2.6 kernel tree.

    [PATCH] USB speedtouch: fix memory leak in error path
    
    Hi Greg, this patch fixes a memory leak in the speedtouch driver.
    The leak occurs when the ATM layer submits a skbuff for transmission,
    but the driver rejects it (because the device has been unplugged for
    example).  The ATM layer requires the driver to free the skbuff in this
    case.  The patch is against your 2.6 kernel tree.

    [PATCH] USB speedtouch: turn on debugging if CONFIG_USB_DEBUG is set
    
    Hi Greg, this causes the speedtouch driver to output non-verbose
    debugging messages if the kernel was configured with CONFIG_USB_DEBUG.
    The patch is against your 2.6 kernel tree.

    [PATCH] x86-64 update
    
    Various fixes and cleanups for x86-64.
    
     - Update defconfig
     - Fix some problems in ROM resource scanning (Rene Herman)
     - Initialize APIC id of CPU 0 (Venkatesh Pallipadi)
     - Always enable swiotlb for GART_IOMMU
     - Fix compilation without IOMMU_GART
     - Remove nodes_present; use standard node_online_map instead.
       This also fixes a bug with no memory on node 0.
     - Switch node<->cpu mapping to arrays. This fixes some awkward
       special cases with no nodes and empty nodes.
     - Move K8 fallback node setup to common code
     - Eliminate old fake_node.
     - Fix wrong fields in MCE handling (Marc Bevand)
     - Make pci_dma_consistent behave more similar to i386 to fix Alsa

    [PATCH] jbd copyout fix
    
    When I converted journal_write_metadata_buffer() to kmap_atomic() I screwed
    up the handling of the copyout buffers - we're currently writing four zeroes
    into the user's page rather than into the data which is to be written to the
    journal (oops).
    
    Net effect: any block which starts with 0xC03B3998 gets scribbled on in
    data=journal mode.

    asm-ia64/ide.h (ide_ioreg_t is unsigned short) and asm-m68knommu/ide.h
    (broken - ide_ioreg_t is not defined) are the only users of ide_ioreg_t left.

    [PATCH] ide-disk.c: workaround for bogus LBA48 drives
    
    From: Geert Uytterhoeven <geert@linux-m68k.org>
    
    Apparently some IDE drives (e.g. a pile of 80 GB ST380020ACE drives I have
    access to) advertise to support LBA48, but don't, causing kernels that support
    LBA48 (i.e. anything newer than 2.4.18, including 2.4.25 and 2.6.4) to fail on
    them.  Older kernels (including 2.2.20 on the Debian woody CDs) work fine.
    
    Check for id->lba_capacity_2 being non-zero in idedisk_supports_lba48().

    [PATCH] e1000: fix eeprom update to include e1000_standby_eeprom
    
    A Bug in e1000_spi_eeprom_ready where the Chip Select bit wasn't being
    toggled after every status register read (if the eeprom wasn't ready after
    the first status register read). The call to e1000_standby_eeprom manages
    the CS bit correctly

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix ibmveth.c compilation
    
    From: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>
    
    This patch changes PCI_DMA_TODEVICE to DMA_TO_DEVICE in a couple of
    places in drivers/net/ibmveth.c, since it doesn't compile without this
    change and it does compile with it.  It also reformats a couple of
    over-long lines in the vicinity of the other changes.

    The paste from rs_ioctl included the command sanity checking, but there's no
    command for tiocm[sg]et.  The compile ends up failing.

    From: <gerg@snapgear.com>
    
    A few fixes for the 68328 "DragonBall" serial driver:
    
    . use irqreturn_t for interrupt handlers
    . correct a few variable types (stop compiler warnings)
    . correctly use return values from put_user(), get_user() and copy_to_user()
    
    Many of these originaly from kernel janitors.

    . reformat port definitions to new style structure init
    . change "addr" field type to reduce casting in ColdFire serial driver
    . cleanup locking problems in mcfrs_write().
    . implement fraction baud rate clock support for hardware that
      supports it (namely the ColdFire 5272)
    . implement wait_until_sent, some ColdFire parts of hardware support
      for this (again the 5272).
    . correctly use return values from put_user(), get_user() and copy_to_user()
    
    Many of these originaly from kernel janitors.

    From: Vincent Sanders <vince@kyllikki.org>
    
    The vga16fb driver uses a direct ioremap on 0xa00000 to gain access to the
    vga card.  This is wrong on architectures other than x86, every other driver
    uses VGA_MAP_MEM macro from vga.h to ensure the correct memory mapping.

    [PATCH] kbuild: Create .tmp_versions when building external modules
    
    From: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>
    
    When building external modules the $PWD/.tmp_versions directory is used.
    The .tmp_versions directory in the kernel tree cannot be used because this
    would clutter up the kernel tree especially when more than one external
    module is being build for the same kernel tree.
    
    This patch make sure to create $PWD/.tmp_versions, and to delete it during
    make clean.  It also removes warning about 'messed with SUBDIRS', this is
    no longer relevant when .tmp_versions is made outside the kernel tree.

    [PATCH] Fix sysfs class support for CAPI
    
    this patch fixes a bug in the CAPI TTY support, because the ->name value
    of the TTY driver shouldn't contain a "/". After changing this there are
    now a "capi20" TTY device and a "capi20" control device and so I renamed
    the control device to "capi". The userspace visible part must be done by
    udev and I added these two rules to restore the old namespace:
    
    	# CAPI devices
    	KERNEL="capi",          NAME="capi20", SYMLINK="isdn/capi20"
    	KERNEL="capi*",         NAME="capi/%n"

    Hi,
    I have an USB contactless reader which uses a FTDI chip. It works well with the
     current ftdi_sio driver, it's just a matter of adding an ID:

    [ARM] use errno #defines in assembly
    
    Patch from: Randy Dunlap
    
    From: Danilo Piazzalunga
    
    Some assembly code (on various archs) either
     1. uses hardcoded errno numbers instead of the canonical macro
        names, or
     2. defines them locally, instead of including the appropriate
        header (while including other headers).
    
    This patch "fixes" such usage in
     - getuser.S for arm
     - putuser.S for arm

    [PATCH] I2C: No reset not limit init in via686a
    
    The following patch removes limits initialization in the via686a driver.
    It was decided some times ago that this belongs to user-space, not
    kernel. See the thread here:
    http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg06134.html
    
    It also prevents the sensor chip from being savagely reset at load time.
    This too follows a decision taken long ago that drivers should do as
    little as possible in their init procedure. See the thread here:
    http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg04593.html
    
    This should make the driver smaller, safer and faster to load. The same
    was done to our 2.4/CVS version of the driver 5 months ago and it seems
    to work just fine.

    [PATCH] I2C: pwm support in w83781d.c
    
    Here is a general pwm support cleanup patch for the w83781d chip driver.
    Featuring:
    
    * Don't pretend that we handle PWM on AS99127F chips. We don't know how
    it works, and one of the register we are accessing for now is clearly
    not a PWM register, and changing its value usually breaks temperature
    readings.
    
    * Discard irrelevant comments.
    
    * Rewrite show_pwmenable_reg. It was obviously taken from the 2.4
    driver, with unneeded tests and the code was much too complicated
    anyway. And now we handle errors correctly.
    
    * Initialize pwm_enable at load time. So far it was done conditionally
    (if init=1) while it should always be done. And pwm2_enable wasn't read
    from the chip, while it should.
    
    I could test that my AS99127F doesn't expose pwm files through ssysfs
    anymore. Which means that I couldn't test the rest of the pwm changes,
    unfortunately.
    
    I've applied similar changes to our 2.4/CVS repository.

    2* I discovered error path problems in it87 and via686a detection
    functions. For the it87, I think that this patch makes it even more
    broken. I will fix both drivers in a later patch (really soon).

    [PATCH] Oprofile: ARM/XScale PMU driver
    
    From: Zwane Mwaikambo <zwane@linuxpower.ca>
    
    The following patch adds support for the XScale performance monitoring unit
    to OProfile.  It uses not only the performance monitoring counters, but
    also the clock cycle counter (CCNT) allowing for upto 5 usable counters.
    
    The code has been developed and tested on an IOP331 (hardware courtesy of
    Intel) therefore i haven't been able to test it on XScale PMU1 systems.
    Testing on said systems would be appreciated, and if done, please uncomment
    the #define DEBUG line at the top of op_model_xscale.c
    
    OProfile userspace support has already been committed and should be
    available via CVS.

    From: Patrick Mochel <mochel@digitalimplant.org>
    
    Here is a patch to make sysfs optional.  Note that with CONFIG_SYSFS=n you
    must specify the boot device's major:minor on the kernel boot command line
    with
    
    	root=03:01
    
    For embedded systems, it will save a significant amount of memory during
    runtime.  And, it saves 4k from the built kernel image for me.

    [PATCH] kbuild: external module support
    
    From: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>
    
    Based on initial patch from Andreas Gruenbacher there is now better support
    for building external modules with kbuild.
    
    The preferred syntax is now:
    make -C $KERNELSRC M=$PWD
    
    but the old syntax:
    make -C $KERNELSRC SUBDIRS=$PWD modules
    will remain supported.
    
    The major differences compared to before are that:
    1) No attempt is made to neither check nor update any files in $KERNELSRC
    2) Module versions are now supported
    
    During stage 2 of kernel compilation where the modules are built, a new file
    Module.symvers is created.  This file contains the version for all symbols
    exported by the kernel and any module compiled within the kernel tree.
    
    When the external module is build the Module.symvers file is being read and
    symbol versions are used from that file.
    
    The purpose of avoiding any updates in the kernel src is that usually in a
    distribution the kernel src will be read-only, and there is no need to try to
    update it.  And when building an external module the focus is on the module,
    not the kernel.
    
    I expect the distributions will start using something like this:
    
    kernel src - with no generated files. Not even .config:
    /usr/src/linux-<version>
    
    Output from build:
    /lib/modules/linux-<version>/build
    
    where build is a real directory with relevant output files and the
    appropriate .config.
    
    I have some Documentation in the pipe-line, but wants to see how this
    approach is received before completing it.
    
    This patch is made on top of the previously posted patch to divide
    make clean in three steps.
    
    And you may need to edit the following line in the patch to make it apply:
     %docs: scripts_basic FORCE
    to
     %docs: scripts FORCE

    [PATCH] kbuild: cleaning in three steps
    
    From: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>
    
    Previously 'make clean' deleted all automatically generated files.  The
    following patch revert this behaviour, and now 'make clean' leaves enough
    behind to allow external modules to be built.
    
    The cleaning is now done in three steps:
    
    make clean     - delete everything not needed for building external modules
    make mrproper  - delete all generated files, including .config
    make distclean - delete all temporary files such as *.orig, *~, *.rej etc.
    
    This fixes reports about nvidia and vmware build issues.

    From: Arjan van de Ven <arjanv@redhat.com>
    
    fb_copy_cmap() takes an argument about wether to do memcpy, copy_from_user or
    copy_to_user.  0 is memcpy, 2 is copy_to_user.  In the ioctl you want
    copy_to_user for copying the colormap to userspace.

    [PATCH] framebuffer bugfix
    
    From: Arjan van de Ven <arjanv@redhat.com>
    
    Patch below fixes a thinko in the frame buffer drivers; the code does
    
    cursor.image.data = kmalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);
    ....
    cursor.mask = kmalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);
    ....
                    if (copy_from_user(&cursor.image.data, sprite->image.data, size) ||
                        copy_from_user(cursor.mask, sprite->mask, size)) {
    ....
    
    where it's clear that the & in the first copy_from_user is utterly bogus
    since the destination is the content of the newly allocated buffer, and not
    the pointer to it as the code does.

    [PATCH] Rename bitmap_clear to bitmap_zero, remove CLEAR_BITMAP
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    clear_bit(n, addr) clears the nth bit.
    test_and_clear_bit(n, addr) clears the nth bit.
    cpu_clear(n, cpumask) clears the nth bit (vs. cpus_clear()).
    bitmap_clear(bitmap, n) clears out all the bits up to n.
    
    Moreover, there's a CLEAR_BITMAP() in linux/types.h which bitmap_clear() is
    a wrapper for.
    
    Rename bitmap_clear to bitmap_zero, which is harder to confuse (yes, it bit
    me), and make everyone use it.

    [PATCH] Fix More Problems Introduced By Module Structure Added in modpost.c
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    Sam Ravnborg found these.
    
    1) have_vmlinux is a global, and should not be reset every time.
    
    2) We pretend every module needs cleanup_module so it gets versioned,
       but that isn't defined for CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD=n.
    
    3) The visible effect of this is that modpost will start complaning about
       undefined symbols - previously this happened only when the module was
       isntalled.

    [PATCH] do_fork() error path memory leak
    
    From: <john.l.byrne@hp.com>
    
    In do_fork(), if an error occurs after the mm_struct for the child has been
    allocated, it is never freed.  The exit_mm() meant to free it increments
    the mm_count and this count is never decremented.  (For a running process
    that is exitting, schedule() takes care this; however, the child process
    being cleaned up is not running.) In the CLONE_VM case, the parent's
    mm_struct will get an extra mm_count and so it will never be freed.
    
    This patch should fix both the CLONE_VM and the not CLONE_VM case; the test
    of p->active_mm prevents a panic in the case that a kernel-thread is being
    cloned.

    [PATCH] Fix Raid5/6 above 2 Terabytes
    
    From: Evan Felix <evan.felix@pnl.gov>
    
    Here is a patch that fixes a major issue in the raid5/6 code.  It seems
    that the code:
    
    logical_sector = bi->bi_sector & ~(STRIPE_SECTORS-1);
    (sector_t)     = (sector_t)    & (constant)
    
    that the right side of the & does not get extended correctly when the
    constant is promoted to the sector_t type.  I have CONFIG_LBD turned on so
    sector_t should be 64bits wide.  This fails to properly mask the value of
    4294967296 (2TB/512) to 4294967296.  in my case it was coming out 0.  this
    cause the loop following this code to read from 0 to 4294967296 blocks so
    it could write one character.
    
    As you might imagine this makes a format of a 3.5TB filesystem take a very
    long time.

    [PATCH] get_user_pages shortcut for anonymous pages
    
    From: Martin Schwidefsky <schwidefsky@de.ibm.com>
    
    The patch avoids the instantiation of pagetables for not-present pages in
    get_user_pages().  Without this, the coredump code can cause total memory
    exhaustion in pagetables.  Consider a store to current stack - 1TB.  The
    stack vma is extended to include this address because of VM_GROWSDOWN.  If
    such a process dies (which is likely for a defunc process) then the elf core
    dumper will cause the system to hang because of too many page tables.
    
    We especially recognise this situation and simply return a ref to the zero
    page.

    From: Rene Herman <rene.herman@keyaccess.nl>
    
    This patch tries to improve the i386/mach-default probe_roms().  This also
    c99ifies the data, adds an IORESOURCE_IO flag for the I/O port resources,
    an IORESOURCE_MEM flag for the VRAM resource, IORESOURCE_READONLY |
    IORESOURCE_MEM for the ROM resources and adds two additional "adapter ROM
    slots" (for a total of 6) since it now also scans the 0xe0000 segment.

    [PATCH] i386 probe_roms(): preparation
    
    From: Rene Herman <rene.herman@keyaccess.nl>
    
    The i386 probe_roms() function has a fair number of problems currently:
    
    - When you actually have an adapter ROM in the machine, your video ROM
      disappears.  This is due to the pc9800 subarch merge that split it up in
      probe_video_rom(int roms) and probe_extension_roms(int roms), but expects a
      "roms++" in probe_video_roms() to have an effect outside of that function.
    
    - The majority of VGA adapters these days host a ROM larger then 32K, yet
      the current code hardcodes a 32K ROM.  The VGA BIOS "length" byte is
      normally valid (it in fact needs to be for a regular mainboard BIOS to
      accept it) and I've verified on a few dozen very new to very old VGAs that
      it is.  However, assuming someone actually did not check for the length and
      checksum there for a reason, the safe thing to do here is accept the length
      byte when we also get a valid checksum.
    
    - The current code scans 0xc0000 to 0xdffff for a video ROM while the
      standard PC thing to do (that which the BIOS does) is only scan for a video
      ROM starting between 0xc0000 and 0xc7fff.  This means that on a headless-
      (or BIOS-less monochrome adapter-) box, the first adapter ROM found
      triggers the registration of a 32K "Video ROM" at hardcoded address
      0xc0000, even when _nothing_ is present between 0xc0000 and 0xc7fff.
    
    - The current adapter ROM scan stops at 0xdffff, whether or not an
      extension ROM is present at 0xe0000.  The PC thing to do is scan 0xc8000
      upto 0xdffff if an extension ROM is present, and upto 0xeffff when it's not
      (it's not/hardly ever).
    
    - Adapter ROMs are called "Extension ROM", but the latter term is really
      better reserved for a motherboard extension ROM.
    
    - Currently, the code happily starts scanning through a ROM it just
      registered looking for the next one (just does += 2048, even when that's
      inside the previous ROM) which is at least silly.
    
    Unfortunately, this code is "subarched" between mach-default and
    mach-pc9800, meaning the patch got a bit involved. Currently all this
    code, and gobs of data, is defined (not just declared) in the header:
    
       include/asm-i386/mach-{default,pc9800}/mach_resources.h
    
    which isn't nice. That .h really wants to be a .c. The first patch, in
    the next message, does not change any code but only undoes the
    probe_video_rom / probe_extension_roms split and moves the code to a new
    file
    
       arch/i386/mach-{default,pc9800}/std_resources.c
    
    with a header
    
       include/asm-i386/std_resources.h
    
    for the prototypes only. The second patch overhauls the code itself for
    mach-default. Please see comments on top of that patch for (yet more)
    comments. It's tested on various machines, with and without adapter ROMs.
    
    I haven't touched pc9800. Nothing should have changed though. The pc9800
    author, as given in the code, is CCed.
    
    Also, x86-64 inherits the probe_roms() code from 2.4, and while it
    doesn't have the subarch specific problems, it has all others. I'll
    convert it to if this i386 version is deemed desirable.
    
    
    
    This patch doesn't change any code, just moves stuff from the
    "mach_resources.h" header to a "std_resources.c" subarch specific file, and
    introduces a "std_resources.h" header for the prototypes.

    [PATCH] jbd: b_transaction zeroing cleanup
    
    Almost everywhere where JBD removes a buffer from the transaction lists the
    caller then nulls out jh->b_transaction.  Sometimes, the caller does that
    without holding the locks which are defined to protect b_transaction.  This
    makes me queazy.
    
    So change things so that __journal_unfile_buffer() nulls out b_transaction
    inside both j_list_lock and jbd_lock_bh_state().
    
    It cleans things up a bit, too.

    [PATCH] jbd: do_get_write_access lock contention reduction
    
    We're seeing heavy contention against j_list_lock on 8-way in
    do_get_write_access().
    
    We actually don't need j_list_lock in there except for one little case - the
    per-bh jbd_lock_bh_state() is sufficient to protect this buffer's internal
    state.
    
    On some nice quick LVM array Ram Pai measured an overall 3x speedup from this
    patch:
    
    the script took the following time on 265mm1
     real    0m57.504s
     user    0m0.400s
     sys     7m29.867s
    
    
     and with the 2patches it took
     real 	0m19.983s
     user    0m0.438s
     sys     1m55.896s

    [PATCH] dnotify_parent speedup
    
    From: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>
    
    Directory notify code was showing up in a dd bs=1024k from 2 raid arrays
    on an emulex FC adapter:
    
    3635     69.4896  vmlinux-2.6.5            .default_idle
    332       6.3468  vmlinux-2.6.5            .__copy_tofrom_user

    61        1.1661  vmlinux-2.6.5            .do_generic_mapping_read
    
    We already have a sysctl to enable/disable it, the patch below uses it
    in dnotify_parent. dnotify_parent disappears and idle time goes up:
    
    4508     70.8582  vmlinux-2.6.5            .default_idle
    253       3.9767  vmlinux-2.6.5            .__copy_tofrom_user
    142       2.2320  vmlinux-2.6.5            .save_remaining_regs
    88        1.3832  vmlinux-2.6.5            .shrink_zone

    69        1.0846  vmlinux-2.6.5            .do_generic_mapping_read
    
    Of course, to gain this small speedup isers need to know to set
    /proc/sys/fs/dir-notify-enable to zero.  Nobody does that.

    [PATCH] cyclades works OK on SMP
    
    From: Marcelo Tosatti <marcelo.tosatti@cyclades.com>
    
    The cyclades.c driver was marked BROKEN_ON_SMP during early 2.6.  It was
    fixed later on but the tag was left in Kconfig.
    
    The driver is not very smart wrt SMP locking, it can be improved.  There is
    only one spinlock per card which guarantees command block ordering and
    protects different shared data, which can be held for long periods.
    
    _But_ the locking works reliably, so remove the BROKEN_ON_SMP tag.

    [PATCH] rmap 3 arches + mapping_mapped
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    Some arches refer to page->mapping for their dcache flushing: use
    page_mapping(page) for safety, to avoid confusion on anon pages, which will
    store a different pointer there - though in most cases flush_dcache_page is
    being applied to pagecache pages.
    
    arm has a useful mapping_mapped macro: move that to generic, and add
    mapping_writably_mapped, to avoid explicit list_empty checks on i_mmap and
    i_mmap_shared in several places.
    
    Very tempted to add page_mapped(page) tests, perhaps along with the
    mapping_writably_mapped tests in do_generic_mapping_read and
    do_shmem_file_read, to cut down on wasted flush_dcache effort; but the
    serialization is not obvious, too unsafe to do in a hurry.

    [PATCH] rw_swap_page_sync fixes
    
    Fix up the rw_swap_page_sync() gorrors by fully decoupling this function
    from the VM - it is now just a helper function which reads a page from or
    writes a page to swap.

    [PATCH] rmap 2 anon and swapcache
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    Tracking anonymous pages by anon_vma,pgoff or mm,address needs a
    pointer,offset pair in struct page: mapping,index the natural choice.  But
    swapcache uses those for &swapper_space,swp_entry_t.
    
    It's trivial to separate swapcache from pagecache with radix tree; most of
    swapper_space is actually unused, just a fiction to pretend swap like file;
    and page->private is a good place to keep swp_entry_t, now that swap never
    uses bufferheads.
    
    Define PG_anon bit, page_add_rmap SetPageAnon and put an oopsable address in
    page->mapping to test that we're not confused by it.  Define
    page_mapping(page) macro to give NULL when PageAnon, whatever may be in
    page->mapping.  Define PG_swapcache bit, deduce swapper_space from that in
    the few places we need it.
    
    add_to_swap_cache now distinct from add_to_page_cache.  Separating the caches
    somewhat simplifies the tmpfs swizzling in swap_state.c, now the page can
    briefly be in both caches.
    
    The rmap method remains pte chains, no change to that yet.  But one small
    functional difference: the use of PageAnon implies that a page truncated
    while still mapped will no longer be found and freed (swapped out) by
    try_to_unmap, will only be freed by exit or munmap.  But normally pages are
    unmapped by vmtruncate: this should only affect nonlinear mappings, and a
    later patch not in this batch will fix that.

    [PATCH] rmap 1 linux/rmap.h
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    First of a batch of three rmap patches: this initial batch of three paving
    the way for a move to some form of object-based rmap (probably Andrea's, but
    drawing from mine too), and making almost no functional change by itself.  A
    few days will intervene before the next batch, to give the struct page
    changes in the second patch some exposure before proceeding.
    
    rmap 1 create include/linux/rmap.h
    
    Start small: linux/rmap-locking.h has already gathered some declarations
    unrelated to locking, and the rest of the rmap declarations were over in
    linux/swap.h: gather them all together in linux/rmap.h, and rename the
    pte_chain_lock to rmap_lock.

    [PATCH] Correct unplugs on nr_queued
    
    From: Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>
    
    There's a small discrepancy in when we decide to unplug a queue based on
    q->unplug_thresh.  Basically it doesn't work for tagged queues, since
    q->rq.count[READ] + q->rq.count[WRITE] is just the number of allocated
    requests, not the number of requests stuck in the io scheduler.  We could
    just change the nr_queued == to a nr_queued >=, however that is still
    suboptimal.
    
    This patch adds accounting for requests that have been dequeued from the io
    scheduler, but not freed yet.  These are q->in_flight.  allocated_requests
    - q->in_flight == requests_in_scheduler.  So the condition correctly
    becomes
    
    	if (requests_in_scheduler == q->unplug_thresh)
    
    instead.  I did a quick round of testing, and for dbench on a SCSI disk the
    number of timer induced unplugs was reduced from 13 to 5 :-).  Not a huge
    number, but there might be cases where it's more significant.  Either way,
    it gets ->unplug_thresh always right, which the old logic didn't.

    [PATCH] Use BIO_RW_SYNC in swap write page
    
    From: Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>
    
    Dog slow software suspend found this one. If WB_SYNC_ALL, then you need
    to mark the bio as sync as well.
    
    This is because swap_writepage() does a remove_exclusive_swap_page() (going
    to __delete_from_swap_cache -> __remove_from_page_cache) which can kill
    page->mapping, thus aops->sync_page() has nothing to work with for unplugging
    the address space.

    [PATCH] per-backing dev unplugging
    
    From: Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>,
          Chris Mason,
          me, others.
    
    The global unplug list causes horrid spinlock contention on many-disk
    many-CPU setups - throughput is worse than halved.
    
    The other problem with the global unplugging is of course that it will cause
    the unplugging of queues which are unrelated to the I/O upon which the caller
    is about to wait.
    
    So what we do to solve these problems is to remove the global unplug and set
    up the infrastructure under which the VFS can tell the block layer to unplug
    only those queues which are relevant to the page or buffer_head whcih is
    about to be waited upon.
    
    We do this via the very appropriate address_space->backing_dev_info structure.
    
    Most of the complexity is in devicemapper, MD and swapper_space, because for
    these backing devices, multiple queues may need to be unplugged to complete a
    page/buffer I/O.  In each case we ensure that data structures are in place to
    permit us to identify all the lower-level queues which contribute to the
    higher-level backing_dev_info.  Each contributing queue is told to unplug in
    response to a higher-level unplug.
    
    To simplify things in various places we also introduce the concept of a
    "synchronous BIO": it is tagged with BIO_RW_SYNC.  The block layer will
    perform an immediate unplug when it sees one of these go past.

    [PATCH] Implement queue congestion callout for device mapper
    
    From: Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>
          Joe Thornber <thornber@redhat.com>
    
    This implements the queue congestion callout for DM stacks.  To make
    bdi_read/write_congested() return correct information.
    
    - md->lock protects all fields in md _except_ md->map
    - md->map_lock protects md->map
    - Anyone who wants to read md->map should use dm_get_table() which
      increments the tables reference count.
    
    This means the spin lock is now only held for the duration of a
    reference count increment.
    
    Udpate:
    
    dm.c: protect md->map with a rw spin lock rather than the md->lock
    semaphore.  Also ensure that everyone accesses md->map through
    dm_get_table(), rather than directly.

    [PATCH] Add queue congestion callout
    
    From: Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>
    
    The VM and VFS use the address_space_backing_dev_info to track the realtime
    status of the device which backs the mapping.  The read_congested and
    write_congested fields are used to determine whether a read or write
    against that device may block.
    
    We use this infrastructure to
    
    a) allow pdflush to service many queues in parallel (by not getting
       stuck on any particular one) and
    
    b) to avoid undesirable and uncontrolled latencies in places such as
       page reclaim and
    
    c) To avoid blocking in readahead operations
    
    The current code only supports simple disk queues (and I have a patch here
    for NFS).  Stacked queues (MD and DM) don't get this information right and
    problems were expected.  Efficiency problems have now been noted and it's
    time to fix it.
    
    This patch lays down the infrastructure which permits the queue
    implementation to get control when someone at a higher level is querying
    the queue's congestion state.  So DM (for example) can run around and
    examine all the queues which contribute to the higher-level queue.
    
    
    It also adds bdi_rw_congested() for code in xfs and ext2 that calls both
    bdi_read_congested() and bdi_write_congested() in a row, and it was "free"
    anyway.

    Currently set_rte() changes RTE without iosapic_lock held. I guess it

    called by PCI driver not only at the boot time. So I think set_rte()
    should get iosapic_lock.

    [PATCH] ia64: Allow IO port space without EFI RT attribute
    
    Some firmware does not require run-time mapping of the legacy IO port
    space.  (It may not need to perform any IO port operations, or it may
    do them with translation disabled.)
    
    (efi_get_iobase): Don't require that IO port space be marked RT, since
    there's no reason the firmware should require mappings for it.
    Thanks to Greg Albrecht for noticing this.
    
    Also, allow attributes in addition to EFI_MEMORY_UC.  I can't
    think of another current attribute that makes sense, but the
    kernel only depends on being able to use UC.

     - Avoid deadlock on bus->subsys.rwsem.
     - Use a macro for all scsi device sysfs attributes.
     - Change proc_name from "dummy" to "zfcp".
     - Don't wait for scsi_add_device to complete while holding a semaphore.
     - Cleanup include files in zfcp_aux.c & zfcp_def.h.
     - Get rid of zfcp_erp_fsf_req_handler.
     - Proper link up/down handling.
     - Avoid possible NULL pointer dereference in zfcp_erp_schedule_work.
     - Remove module_exit function. Without an external release function for

    [PATCH] fix posix-timers to have proper per-process scope
    
    From: Roland McGrath <roland@redhat.com>
    
    The posix-timers implementation associates timers with the creating thread
    and destroys timers when their creator thread dies.  POSIX clearly
    specifies that these timers are per-process, and a timer should not be torn
    down when the thread that created it exits.  I hope there won't be any
    controversy on what the correct semantics are here, since POSIX is clear
    and the Linux feature is called "posix-timers".
    
    The attached program built with NPTL -lrt -lpthread demonstrates the bug.
    The program is correct by POSIX, but fails on Linux.  Note that a until
    just the other day, NPTL had a trivial bug that always disabled its use of
    kernel timer syscalls (check strace for lack of timer_create/SYS_259).  So
    unless you have built your own NPTL libs very recently, you probably won't
    see the kernel calls actually used by this program.
    
    Also attached is my patch to fix this.  It (you guessed it) moves the
    posix_timers field from task_struct to signal_struct.  Access is now
    governed by the siglock instead of the task lock.  exit_itimers is called
    from __exit_signal, i.e.  only on the death of the last thread in the
    group, rather than from do_exit for every thread.  Timers' it_process
    fields store the group leader's pointer, which won't die.  For the case of
    SIGEV_THREAD_ID, I hold a ref on the task_struct for it_process to stay
    robust in case the target thread dies; the ref is released and the dangling
    pointer cleared when the timer fires and the target thread is dead.  (This
    should only come up in a buggy user program, so noone cares exactly how the
    kernel handles that case.  But I think what I did is robust and sensical.)

    [PATCH] binfmt_elf.c fix for 32-bit apps with large bss
    
    From: Julie DeWandel <jdewand@redhat.com>
    
    A problem exists where a 32-bit application can have a huge bss, one that
    is so large that an overflow of the TASK_SIZE happens.  But in this case,
    the overflow is not detected in load_elf_binary().  Instead, because
    arithmetic is being done using 32-bit containers, a truncation occurs and
    the program gets loaded when it shouldn't have been.  Subsequent execution
    yields unpredictable results.
    
    The attached patch fixes this problem by checking for the overflow
    condition and sending a SIGKILL to the application if the overflow is
    detected.  This problem can in theory exist when loading the elf
    interpreter as well, so a similar check was added there.

    security transition would normally occur due to policy, but the resulting
    security context is not valid.  The patch also changes the code to always
    call the audit framework rather than only doing so when permissive as this
    was causing problems with testing policy, and does some code cleanup.

    [PATCH] Light-weight Auditing Framework
    
    From: Rik Faith <faith@redhat.com>
    
    This patch provides a low-overhead system-call auditing framework for Linux
    that is usable by LSM components (e.g., SELinux).  This is an update of the
    patch discussed in this thread:
    
        http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=107815888100001&r=1&w=2
    
    In brief, it provides for netlink-based logging of audit records that have
    been generated in other parts of the kernel (e.g., SELinux) as well as the
    ability to audit system calls, either independently (using simple
    filtering) or as a compliment to the audit record that another part of the
    kernel generated.
    
    The main goals were to provide system call auditing with 1) as low overhead
    as possible, and 2) without duplicating functionality that is already
    provided by SELinux (and/or other security infrastructures).  This
    framework will work "stand-alone", but is not designed to provide, e.g.,
    CAPP functionality without another security component in place.
    
    This updated patch includes changes from feedback I have received,
    including the ability to compile without CONFIG_NET (and better use of
    tabs, so use -w if you diff against the older patch).
    
    Please see http://people.redhat.com/faith/audit/ for an early example
    user-space client (auditd-0.4.tar.gz) and instructions on how to try it.
    
    My future intentions at the kernel level include improving filtering (e.g.,
    syscall personality/exit codes) and syscall support for more architectures.
     First, though, I'm going to work on documentation, a (real) audit daemon,
    and patches for other user-space tools so that people can play with the
    framework and understand how it can be used with and without SELinux.
    
    
    Update:
    
    Light-weight Auditing Framework receive filter fixes
    From: Rik Faith <faith@redhat.com>
    
    Since audit_receive_filter() is only called with audit_netlink_sem held, it
    cannot race with either audit_del_rule() or audit_add_rule(), so the
    list_for_each_entry_rcu()s may be replaced by list_for_each_entry()s, and
    the rcu_read_{un,}lock()s removed.  A fix for this is part of the attached
    patch.
    
    Other features of the attached patch are:
    
    1) generalized the ability to test for inequality
    
    2) added syscall exit status reporting and testing
    
    3) added ability to report and test first 4 syscall arguments (this adds
       a large amount of flexibility for little cost; not implemented or tested
       on ppc64)
    
    4) added ability to report and test personality
    
    User-space demo program enhanced for new fields and inequality testing:

    [PATCH] selinux: add IPv6 support
    
    From: James Morris <jmorris@redhat.com>
    
    The patch below adds explicit IPv6 support to SELinux.
    
    Brief description of changes:
    
    o IPv6 networking is now subject to the same controls as IPv4 (in
      addition to the generic socket permissions which cover all protocols),
      namely: bind to local node address; bind to local port; send & receive
      TCP/UDP and raw IP packets based on local network interface and remote
      node address.
    
    o Packet parsing has been extended to IPv6 packets for logging and
      control, and simplified for IPv4.
    
    o Support for logging of IPv6 addresses has also been added.
    
    o The kernel policy database code has been modified to support IPv6, and
      reworked to provide generic security policy version handling so that
      older policy versions will still work, making upgrading simpler.
    
    Corresponding userspace patches are available at
    <http://people.redhat.com/jmorris/selinux/ipv6/>, although current
    userspace tools will continue to function normally (but without explicit
    IPv6 support).
    
    For more details at the security management level, see
    <http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=selinux&m=108068187630948&w=2>
    
    This code has been under testing and review for several weeks.

     If that buffer gets dirtied again (via mmap for example), the reiserfs

    The fix is to make sure we remove the journal handle when we unmap buffers.

    From: Chris Mason <mason@suse.com>
    
    reiserfs logging rework, making things much faster for small transactions.
    metadata buffers are dirtied when they are safe to write, so normal kernel
    mechanisms can contribute to log cleaning.

    [PATCH] Fix ext3 transaction batching
    
    ext3 transaction batching has been ineffective since the scheduler changes
    forced us to replace the yield() with a schedule().
    
    Using schedule_timeout(1) fixes it up again.  Benchmarking is positive with
    wither a 1 or 10 millisecond delay in there, so there appears to be no need
    to play around with HZ.

    [PATCH] Non-Exec stack support
    
    From: Kurt Garloff <garloff@suse.de>
    
    A patch to parse the elf binaries for a PT_GNU_STACK section to set the stack
    non-executable if possible.  Most parts have been shamelessly stolen from
    Ingo Molnar's more ambitious stackshield
    http://people.redhat.com/mingo/exec-shield/exec-shield-2.6.4-C9
    
    The toolchain has meanwhile support for marking the binaries with a
    PT_GNU_STACK section wwithout x bit as needed.
    
    If no such section is found, we leave the stack to whatever the arch defaults
    to.  If there is one, we explicitly disabled the VM_EXEC bit if no x bit is
    found, otherwise explicitly enable.

    From: Olaf Kirch <okir@suse.de>
    
    The attached patch fixes a problem with the 32bit statfs call on NFS file
    systems.  Some NFS servers return a value of -1 for the f_files and f_ffree.
    The current code would think this is a 64bit value that cannot be converted
    to 32bits.  Consequently, the system call would always fail.
    
    The patch adds two special if() to detect a value of -1 for f_files and
    f_ffree.

    [PATCH] v4l: bttv driver update
    
    From: Gerd Knorr <kraxel@bytesex.org>
    
    This patch updates the bttv driver.  Changes:
    
      (1) several card-specific tweaks.
      (2) make software vs. hardware i2c configurable per TV card.
      (3) reinitialize image parameters after chip reset.
      (4) make bttv quite by default on frame drops.
      (5) new insmod option: "debug_latency=1" to enable frame drop
          debug messages.
    
    bttv is quite sensitive to irq latencies, especially when capturing both
    video and vbi.  There are several reports about problems due to this, I don't
    see that on my machines through.  (5) dumps a stracktrace if the driver
    thinks the frame drop is is caused by high latencies as experiment, lets see
    whenever that helps ...

      here, and can hurt
    
    - ratelimit the friendly warnings.

    [PATCH] ppc64: NUMA fix for 16MB LMBs
    
    From: Olof Johansson <olof@austin.ibm.com>
    
    As discussed on the ppc64 list yesterday and today:
    
    On some ppc64 systems, Open Firmware will give memory device nodes that are
    only 16MB in size, instead of the 256MB that our NUMA code currently
    expects (see MEMORY_INCREMENT in mmzone.h).
    
    Just changing the defines from 256MB to 16MB makes the table blow up from
    32KB to 512KB, so this patch also makes it dynamically allocated based on
    actual memory size.  Since all this is done before (well, during) bootmem
    init so we need to use lmb_alloc().
    
    Finally, there's no need to use a full int for node ID. Current max is 16
    nodes, so a signed char still leaves plenty of room to grow.

    [PATCH] ia32: 4Kb stacks (and irqstacks) patch
    
    From: Arjan van de Ven <arjanv@redhat.com>
    
    Below is a patch to enable 4Kb stacks for x86. The goal of this is to
    
    1) Reduce footprint per thread so that systems can run many more threads
       (for the java people)
    
    2) Reduce the pressure on the VM for order > 0 allocations. We see real life
       workloads (granted with 2.4 but the fundamental fragmentation issue isn't
       solved in 2.6 and isn't solvable in theory) where this can be a problem.
       In addition order > 0 allocations can make the VM "stutter" and give more
       latency due to having to do much much more work trying to defragment
    
    The first 2 bits of the patch actually affect compiler options in a generic
    way: I propose to disable the -funit-at-a-time feature from gcc.  With this
    enabled (and it's default with -O2), gcc will very agressively inline
    functions, which is nice and all for userspace, but for the kernel this makes
    us suffer a gcc deficiency more: gcc is extremely bad at sharing stackslots,
    for example a situation like this:
    
    if (some_condition)
    	function_A();
    else
    	function_B();
    
    with -funit-at-a-time, both function_A() and _B() might get inlined, however
    the stack usage of both functions of the parent function grows the stack
    usage of both functions COMBINED instead of the maximum of the two.  Even
    with the normal 8Kb stacks this is a danger since we see some functions grow
    3Kb to 4Kb of stack use this way.  With 4Kb stacks, 4Kb of stack usage growth
    obviously is deadly ;-( but even with 8Kb stacks it's pure lottery.
    Disabling -funit-at-a-time also exposes another thing in the -mm tree; the
    attribute always_inline is considered harmful by gcc folks in that when gcc
    makes a decision to NOT inline a function marked this way, it throws an
    error.  Disabling -funit-at-a-time disables some of the agressive inlining
    (eg of large functions that come later in the .c file) so this would make
    your tree not compile.
    
    The 4k stackness of the kernel is included in modversions, so people don't
    load 4k-stack modules into 8k-stack kernels.
    
    At present 4k stacks are selectable in config.  When the feature has settled
    in we should remove the 8k option.  This will break the nvidia modules.  But
    Fedora uses 4k stacks so a new nvidia driver is expected soon.

    [PATCH] Fix logic in filemap_nopage()
    
    The filempa_nopage() logic will go into a tight loop if
    do_page_cache_readahead() doesn't actually start I/O against the target page.
    This can happen if the disk is read-congested, or if the filesystem doesn't

    [PATCH] Honour the readahead tunable in filemap_nopage()
    
    Remove the hardwired pagefault readaround distance in filemap_nopage() and
    use the per-file readahead setting.
    
    The main reason for this is in fact laptop-mode.  If you want to prevent the
    disk from spinning up then you want all of your application's pages to be
    pulled into memory in one hit.  Otherwise the disk will spin up each time you
    use a new part of whatever application(s) you are running.

    [PATCH] Add commit=0 to ext3, meaning "set commit to default".
    
    From: Bart Samwel <bart@samwel.tk>
    
    Add support for the value "0" to ext3's "commit" option.  When this value
    is given, ext3 substitutes it by the default commit interval.  Introduce a
    constant JBD_DEFAULT_MAX_COMMIT_AGE for this.

    [PATCH] laptop mode
    
    From: Bart Samwel <bart@samwel.tk>
    
    Adds /proc/sys/vm/laptop-mode: a special knob which says "this is a laptop".
    In this mode the kernel will attempt to avoid spinning disks up.
    
    Algorithm: the idea is to hold dirty data in memory for a long time, but to
    flush everything which has been accumulated if the disk happens to spin up
    for other reasons.
    
    - Whenever a disk request completes (read or write), schedule a timer a few
      seconds hence.  If the timer was already pending, reset it to a few seconds
      hence.
    
    - When the timer expires, write back the whole world.  We use
      sync_filesystems() for this because it will force ext3 journal commits as
      well.
    
    - In balance_dirty_pages(), kick off background writeback when we hit the
      high threshold (dirty_ratio), not when we hit the low threshold.  This has
      the effect of causing "lumpy" writeback which is something I spent a year
      fixing, but in laptop mode, it is desirable.
    
    - In try_to_free_pages(), only kick pdflush if the VM is getting into
      distress: we want to keep scanning for clean pages, deferring writeback.
    
    - In page reclaim, avoid writing back the odd random dirty page off the
      LRU: only start I/O if the scanning is working harder.
    
    The effect is to perform a sync() a few seconds after all I/O has ceased.
    
    The value which was written into /proc/sys/vm/laptop-mode determines, in
    seconds, the delay between the final I/O and the flush.
    
    Additionally, the patch adds tools which help answer the question "why the
    heck does my disk spin up all the time?".  The user may set
    /proc/sys/vm/block_dump to a non-zero value and the kernel will print out
    information which will identify the process which is performing disk reads or
    which is dirtying pagecache.
    
    The user should probably disable syslogd before setting block-dump.

    possible for this find_vma to fail, while unmap_vmas drops page_table_lock
    (but that is no problem for file truncation).

    [PATCH] mremap: vma_relink_file race fix
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    Subtle point from Rajesh Venkatasubramanian: when mremap's move_vma fails and
    so rewinds, before moving the file-based ptes back, we must move new_vma
    before old vma in the i_mmap or i_mmap_shared list, so that when racing
    against vmtruncate we cannot propagate pages to be truncated back from
    new_vma into the just cleaned old_vma.

    [PATCH] mremap: move_vma fixes and cleanup
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    Partial rewrite of mremap's move_vma.  Rajesh Venkatasubramanian has pointed
    out that vmtruncate could miss ptes, leaving orphaned pages, because move_vma
    only made the new vma visible after filling it.  We see no good reason for
    that, and time to make move_vma more robust.
    
    Removed all its vma merging decisions, leave them to mmap.c's vma_merge, with
    copy_vma added.  Removed duplicated is_mergeable_vma test from vma_merge, and
    duplicated validate_mm from insert_vm_struct.
    
    move_vma move from old to new then unmap old; but on error move back from new
    to old and unmap new.  Don't unwind within move_page_tables, let move_vma
    call it explicitly to unwind, with the right source vma.  Get the
    VM_ACCOUNTing right even when the final do_munmap fails.

    [PATCH] fork vma ordering during fork
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    First of six patches against 2.6.5-rc3, cleaning up mremap's move_vma, and
    fixing truncation orphan issues raised by Rajesh Venkatasubramanian.
    Originally done as part of the anonymous objrmap work on mremap move, but
    useful fixes now extracted for mainline.  The mremap changes need some
    exposure in the -mm tree first, but the first (fork one-liner) is safe enough
    to go straight into 2.6.5.
    
    
    
    From: Rajesh Venkatasubramanian.  Despite the comment that child vma should
    be inserted just after parent vma, 2.5.6 did exactly the reverse: thus a
    racing vmtruncate may free the child's ptes, then advance to the parent, and
    meanwhile copy_page_range has propagated more ptes from the parent to the
    child, leaving file pages still mapped after truncation.

    [PATCH] use compound pages for hugetlb pages only
    
    The compound page logic is a little fragile - it relies on additional
    metadata in the pageframes which some other kernel code likes to stomp on
    (xfs was doing this).
    
    Also, because we're treating all higher-order pages as compound pages it is
    no longer possible to free individual lower-order pages from the middle of
    higher-order pages.  At least one ARM driver insists on doing this.
    
    We only really need the compound page logic for higher-order pages which can
    be mapped into user pagetables and placed under direct-io.  This covers
    hugetlb pages and, conceivably, soundcard DMA buffers which were allcoated
    with a higher-order allocation but which weren't marked PageReserved.
    
    The patch arranges for the hugetlb implications to allocate their pages with
    compound page metadata, and all other higher-order allocations go back to the
    old way.

    [PATCH] writeback efficiency and QoS improvements
    
    The radix-tree walk for writeback has a couple of problems:
    
    a) It always scans a file from its first dirty page, so if someone
       is repeatedly dirtying the front part of a file, pages near the end
       may be starved of writeout.  (Well, not completely: the `kupdate'
       function will write an entire file once the file's dirty timestamp
       has expired).
    
    b) When the disk queues are huge (10000 requests), there can be a
       very large number of locked pages.  Scanning past these in writeback
       consumes quite some CPU time.
    
    So in each address_space we record the index at which the last batch of
    writeout terminated and start the next batch of writeback from that
    point.

    [PATCH] don't allow background writes to hide dirty buffers
    
    If pdflush hits a locked-and-clean buffer in __block_write_full_page() it
    will just pass over the buffer.  Typically the buffer is an ext3 data=ordered
    buffer which is being written by kjournald, but a similar thing can happen
    with blockdev buffers and ll_rw_block().
    
    This is bad because the buffer is still under I/O and a subsequent fsync's
    fdatawait() needs to know about it.
    
    It is not practical to tag the page for writeback - only the submitter of the
    I/O can do that, because the submitter has control of the end_io handler.
    
    So instead, redirty the page so a subsequent fsync's fdatawrite() will wait on
    the underway I/O.
    
    There is a risk that pdflush::background_writeout() will lock up, repeatedly
    trying and failing to write the same page.  This is prevented by ensuring
    that background_writeout() always throttles when it made no progress.

    [PATCH] fdatasync integrity fix
    
    fdatasync can fail to wait on some pages due to a race.
    
    If some task (eg pdflush) is flushing the same mapping it can remove a page's
    dirty tag but not then mark that page as being under writeback, because
    pdflush hit a locked buffer in __block_write_full_page().  This will happen
    because kjournald is writing the buffer.  In this situation
    __block_write_full_page() will redirty the page so that fsync notices it, but
    there is a window where the page eludes the radix tree dirty page walk.
    
    Consequently a concurrent fsync will fail to notice the page when walking the
    radix tree's dirty pages.
    
    The approach taken by this patch is to leave the page marked as dirty in the
    radix tree while ->writepage is working out what to do with it.  This ensures
    that a concurrent write-for-sync will successfully locate the page and will
    then block in lock_page() until the non-write-for-sync code has finished
    altering the page state.

    This code is playing with page->lru from pages which came from slab.  But to

    This optimisation was pretty thin, and it is more important to shrink the
    pageframe (on all architectures).

    [PATCH] make the pagecache lock irq-safe.
    
    Intro to these patches:
    
    - Major surgery against the pagecache, radix-tree and writeback code.  This
      work is to address the O_DIRECT-vs-buffered data exposure horrors which
      we've been struggling with for months.
    
      As a side-effect, 32 bytes are saved from struct inode and eight bytes
      are removed from struct page.  At a cost of approximately 2.5 bits per page
      in the radix tree nodes on 4k pagesize, assuming the pagecache is densely
      populated.  Not all pages are pagecache; other pages gain the full 8 byte
      saving.
    
      This change will break any arch code which is using page->list and will
      also break any arch code which is using page->lru of memory which was
      obtained from slab.
    
      The basic problem which we (mainly Daniel McNeil) have been struggling
      with is in getting a really reliable fsync() across the page lists while
      other processes are performing writeback against the same file.  It's like
      juggling four bars of wet soap with your eyes shut while someone is
      whacking you with a baseball bat.  Daniel pretty much has the problem
      plugged but I suspect that's just because we don't have testcases to
      trigger the remaining problems.  The complexity and additional locking
      which those patches add is worrisome.
    
      So the approach taken here is to remove the page lists altogether and
      replace the list-based writeback and wait operations with in-order
      radix-tree walks.
    
      The radix-tree code has been enhanced to support "tagging" of pages, for
      later searches for pages which have a particular tag set.  This means that
      we can ask the radix tree code "find me the next 16 dirty pages starting at
      pagecache index N" and it will do that in O(log64(N)) time.
    
      This affects I/O scheduling potentially quite significantly.  It is no
      longer the case that the kernel will submit pages for I/O in the order in
      which the application dirtied them.  We instead submit them in file-offset
      order all the time.
    
      This is likely to be advantageous when applications are seeking all over
      a large file randomly writing small amounts of data.  I haven't performed
      much benchmarking, but tiobench random write throughput seems to be
      increased by 30%.  Other tests appear to be unaltered.  dbench may have got
      10-20% quicker, but it's variable.
    
      There is one large file which everyone seeks all over randomly writing
      small amounts of data: the blockdev mapping which caches filesystem
      metadata.  The kernel's IO submission patterns for this are now ideal.
    
    
      Because writeback and wait-for-writeback use a tree walk instead of a
      list walk they are no longer livelockable.  This probably means that we no
      longer need to hold i_sem across O_SYNC writes and perhaps fsync() and
      fdatasync().  This may be beneficial for databases: multiple processes
      writing and syncing different parts of the same file at the same time can
      now all submit and wait upon writes to just their own little bit of the
      file, so we can get a lot more data into the queues.
    
      It is trivial to implement a part-file-fdatasync() as well, so
      applications can say "sync the file from byte N to byte M", and multiple
      applications can do this concurrently.  This is easy for ext2 filesystems,
      but probably needs lots of work for data-journalled filesystems and XFS and
      it probably doesn't offer much benefit over an i_semless O_SYNC write.
    
    
      These patches can end up making ext3 (even) slower:
    
    	for i in 1 2 3 4
    	do
    		dd if=/dev/zero of=$i bs=1M count=2000 &
    	done
    
      runs awfully slow on SMP.  This is, yet again, because all the file
      blocks are jumbled up and the per-file linear writeout causes tons of
      seeking.  The above test runs sweetly on UP because the on UP we don't
      allocate blocks to different files in parallel.
    
      Mingming and Badari are working on getting block reservation working for
      ext3 (preallocation on steroids).  That should fix ext3 up.
    
    
    This patch:
    
    - Later, we'll need to access the radix trees from inside disk I/O
      completion handlers.  So make mapping->page_lock irq-safe.  And rename it
      to tree_lock to reliably break any missed conversions.

    [PATCH] radix-tree tags for selective lookup
    
    Add radix-tree tagging so we can look up dirty or writeback pages in
    O(log64(n)) time.
    
    Each radix-tree node gains two bits for each slot: one for page dirtiness and
    one for page writebackness.
    
    If a tag bit is set on a leaf node, it indicates that item at the
    corresponding slot is tagged (say, a dirty page).
    
    If a tag bit is set in a non-leaf node it indicates that the same tag bit is
    set in the subtree which lies under the corresponding slot.  ie: "there is a
    dirty page under here somewhere, but you need to search down further to find
    it".
    
    A gang lookup function is provided which can walk the radix tree in
    logarithmic time looking for items which are tagged, starting from a
    specified offset.  We use this for in-order searches for dirty or writeback
    pages.
    
    There is a userspace test harness for this code at

    [PATCH] rw_swap_page_sync(): place the pages in swapcache
    
    This function is setting page->mapping = swapper_space, but isn't actually
    adding the page to swapcache.  This triggers soon-to-be-added BUGs in the
    radix tree code.
    
    So temporarily add these pages to swapcache for real.
    
    Also, make rw_swap_page_sync() go away if it has no callers.

    [PATCH] AIO+DIO bio_count race fix
    
    From: Suparna Bhattacharya <suparna@in.ibm.com>,
          Daniel McNeil <daniel@osdl.org>
    
    This patch ensures that when the DIO code falls back to buffered i/o after
    having submitted part of the i/o, then buffered i/o is issued only for the
    remaining part of the request (i.e.  the part not already covered by DIO),
    rather than redo the entire i/o.  Now, instead of returning written ==
    -ENOTBLK, generic_file_direct_IO returns the number of bytes already handled
    by DIO, so that the caller knows how much of the I/O is left to be handled
    via fallback to buffered write.
    
    We need to careful not to access dio fields if its possible that the dio
    could already have been freed asynchronously during i/o completion.  A tricky
    part of this involves plugging the window between the decrement of bio_count
    and accessing dio->waiter during i/o completion where the dio could get freed
    by the submission path.  This potential "bio_count race" was tackled (by
    Daniel) by changing bio_list_lock into bio_lock and using that for all the
    bio fields.  Now bio_count and bios_in_flight have been converted from
    atomics into int and are both protected by the bio_lock.  The race in
    finished_one_bio() could thus be fixed by leaving the bio_count at 1 until
    after the dio_complete() and then doing the bio_count decrement and wakeup
    holding the bio_lock.  It appears that shifting to the spin_lock instead of
    atomic_inc/decs is ok performance wise as well.
    
    Update:
    
    An AIO O_DIRECT request was extending the file so it was done
    synchronously.  However, the request got an EFAULT and direct_io_worker()
    was calling aio_complete() on the iocb and returning the EFAULT.  When
    io_submit_one() got the EFAULT return, it assume it had to call
    aio_complete() since the i/o never got queued.
    
    The fix is for direct_io_worker() to only call aio_complete() when the
    upper layer is going to return -EIOCBQUEUED and not when getting errors
    that are being return to the submit path.

    [PATCH] direct-io AIO fixes
    
    From: Suparna Bhattacharya <suparna@in.ibm.com>
    
    Fixes the following remaining issues with the DIO code:
    
    1. During DIO file extends, intermediate writes could extend i_size
       exposing unwritten blocks to intermediate reads (Soln: Don't drop i_sem
       for file extends)
    
    2. AIO-DIO file extends may update i_size before I/O completes,
       exposing unwritten blocks to intermediate reads.  (Soln: Force AIO-DIO
       file extends to be synchronous)
    
    3. AIO-DIO writes to holes call aio_complete() before falling back to
       buffered I/O !  (Soln: Avoid calling aio_complete() if -ENOTBLK)
    
    4. AIO-DIO writes to an allocated region followed by a hole, falls back
       to buffered i/o without waiting for already submitted i/o to complete;
       might return to user-space, which could overwrite the buffer contents
       while they are still being written out by the kernel (Soln: Always wait
       for submitted i/o to complete before falling back to buffered i/o)

    [PATCH] blockdev direct-io speedups
    
    From: Badari Pulavarty <pbadari@us.ibm.com>
    
    1) blkdev_direct_IO() calls blockdev_direct_IO() instead of
       blockdev_direct_IO_no_locking().
    
    2) writev entry point is generic_file_writev() which grabs i_sem.  It
       should use generic_file_write_nolock() instead.

    [PATCH] Fix race between ll_rw_block() and block_write_full_page()
    
    Fix a race which was identified by Daniel McNeil <daniel@osdl.org>
    
    If a buffer_head is under I/O due to JBD's ordered data writeout (which uses
    ll_rw_block()) then either filemap_fdatawrite() or filemap_fdatawait() need
    to wait on the buffer's existing I/O.
    
    Presently neither will do so, because __block_write_full_page() will not
    actually submit any I/O and will hence not mark the page as being under
    writeback.
    
    The best-performing fix would be to somehow mark the page as being under
    writeback and defer waiting for the ll_rw_block-initiated I/O until
    filemap_fdatawait()-time.  But this is hard, because in
    __block_write_full_page() we do not have control of the buffer_head's end_io
    handler.  Possibly we could make JBD call into end_buffer_async_write(), but
    that gets nasty.
    
    This patch makes __block_write_full_page() wait for any buffer_head I/O to
    complete before inspecting the buffer_head state.  It only does this in the
    case where __block_write_full_page() was called for a "data-integrity" write:
    (wbc->sync_mode != WB_SYNC_NONE).
    
    Probably it doesn't matter, because kjournald is currently submitting (or has
    already submitted) all dirty buffers anyway.

    [PATCH] O_DIRECT data exposure fixes
    
    From: Badari Pulavarty, Suparna Bhattacharya, Andrew Morton
    
    Forward port of Stephen Tweedie's DIO fixes from 2.4, to fix various DIO vs
    buffered IO exposures involving races causing:
    
    (a) stale data from uninstantiated blocks to be read, e.g.
    
        - O_DIRECT reads against buffered writes to a sparse region
    
        - O_DIRECT writes to a sparse region against buffered reads
    
    (b) potential data corruption with
    
        - O_DIRECT IOs against truncate
    
        due to writes to truncated blocks (which may have been reallocated to
        another file).
    
    Summary of fixes:
    
    1) All the changes affect only regular files.  RAW/O_DIRECT on block are
       unaffected.
    
    2) The DIO code will not fill in sparse regions on a write.  Instead
       -ENOTBLK is returned and the generic file write code would fallthrough to
       buffered IO in this case followed by writing through the pages to disk
       using filemap_fdatawrite/wait.
    
    3) i_sem is held during both DIO reads and writes.  For reads, and writes
       to already allocated blocks, it is released right after IO is issued,
       while for writes to newly allocated blocks (e.g file extending writes and
       hole overwrites) it is held all the way through until IO completes (and
       data is committed to disk).
    
    4) filemap_fdatawrite/wait are called under i_sem to synchronize buffered
       pages to disk blocks before issuing DIO.
    
    5) A new rwsem (i_alloc_sem) is held in shared mode all the while a DIO
       (read or write) is in progress, and in exclusive mode by truncate to guard
       against deallocation of data blocks during DIO.
    
    6) All this new locking has been pushed down into blockdev_direct_IO to
       avoid interfering with NFS direct IO.  The locks are taken in the order
       i_sem followed by i_alloc_sem.  While i_sem may be released after IO
       submission in some cases, i_alloc_sem is held through until dio_complete
       (in the case of AIO-DIO this happens through the IO completion callback).
    
    7) i_sem and i_alloc_sem are not held for the _nolock versions of write
       routines, as used by blockdev and XFS.  Filesystems can specify the
       needs_special_locking parameter to __blockdev_direct_IO from their direct
       IO address space op accordingly.
    
    Note from Badari:
    Here is the locking (when needs_special_locking is true):
    
    (1) generic_file_*_write() holds i_sem (as before) and calls
        ->direct_IO().  blockdev_direct_IO gets i_alloc_sem and call
        direct_io_worker().
    
    (2) generic_file_*_read() does not hold any locks.  blockdev_direct_IO()
        gets i_sem and then i_alloc_sem and calls direct_io_worker() to do the
        work
    
    (3) direct_io_worker() does the work and drops i_sem after submitting IOs
        if appropriate and drops i_alloc_sem after completing IOs.

    [PATCH] ia64 MSI support
    
    From: "Nguyen, Tom L" <tom.l.nguyen@intel.com>
    
    Adds MSI support for ia64.
    
    - Modified existing code in drivers/pci/msi.c and drivers/pci/msi.h to
      include MSI support on IA64 platform.
    
    - Based on the comments received from Zwane Mwaikambo and David Mosberger,
      this patch consolidates the vector allocators as
      assign_irq_vector(AUTO_ASSIGN) has the same semantics as
      ia64_alloc_vector() by converting the existing uses of ia64_alloc_vector()
      to assign_irq_vector(AUTO_ASSIGN).
    
    - Based on the comments received from Zwane Mwaikambo, this patch
      consolidates the semantics of vector allocator assign_irq_vector() in
      drivers/pci/msi.c into the relevant architecture's vector allocator
      assign_irq_vector() in arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c.
    
    - Regarding vector allocation, this patch modifies the existing function
      assign_irq_vector() to maximize the number of allocated vectors to 188
      before going -ENOSPC.
    
    - Based on your comments, this patch creates <asm-i386/msi.h>,
      <asm-ia64/msi.h> and <asm-x86_64/msi.h>, includes <asm/msi.h> from within
      drivers/pci/msi.h and then places all the code which is currently under
      ifdef in msi.h into the relevant architecture's <asm/msi.h> file.
    
    - Based on your comments, this patch places pci_vector_resources() in
      existing drivers/pci/msi.c in the relevant architecture implementations
      such as into arch/.../pci/irq.c.

    [PATCH] Fix huge sparse tmpfs files
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    Kevin P.  Fleming pointed out that the 2.6 tmpfs does not allow writing huge
    sparse files.  This is an unintended side-effect of the strict memory commit
    changes: which should make no difference.
    
    The solution is to treat the tmpfs files (of variable size) and the shmem
    objects (of fixed size) differently: sounds nasty but works out well.  The
    shmem objects follow the VM preallocation convention as before, but the tmpfs
    files revert to allocation on demand as a filesystem would.  If there's not
    enough memory to write to a tmpfs hole, it is reported as -ENOSPC rather than
    -ENOMEM, so the mmap writer gets SIGBUS rather than everyone else getting
    OOM-killed.

    A small (but hopefully forgiveable) cleanup is a spelling correction:
    s/bitmap_shift_write/bitmap_shift_right/ in one of the kerneldoc comments.
    
    The primary effect of the patch is to remove the MAX_BITMAP_BITS
    limitation, so restoring the NR_CPUS to be limited only by stackspace and
    slab allocator maximums.  They also look vaguely more efficient than the
    current code, though as this was not done for performance reasons, no
    performance testing was done.

    [PATCH] Support for floppies whose sectors are numbered from zero instead of one
    
    From: Marcelo Tosatti <marcelo.tosatti@cyclades.com>
    
    From: Alain Knaff <alain.knaff@lll.lu>
    
    This patch adds support for floppy disks whose sectors are numbered
    starting at 0 rather than 1 as usual disks would be.  This format is used
    for some CP/M disks, and also for certain music samplers (such as Ensoniq
    Ensoniq EPS 16plus).
    
    In order to use it, you need an fdutils with the current patch from
    http://fdutils.linux.lu as well, and then do setfdrpm /dev/fd0 dd zerobased
    sect=10 or setfdprm /dev/fd0 hd zerobased sect.
    
    In addtion, the patch also fixes my email addresses.  I no longer use
    pobox.com.

    [PATCH] fix modversions now __this_module is created only in .ko
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    Brian Gerst's patch which moved __this_module out from module.h into the
    module post-processing had a side effect.  genksyms didn't see the
    undefined symbols for modules without a module_init (or module_exit), and
    hence didn't generate a version for them, causing the kernel to be tainted.
    
    The simple solution is to always include the versions for these functions.
    Also includes two cleanups:
    
    1) alloc_symbol is easier to use if it populates ->next for us.
    
    2) add_exported_symbol should set owner to module, not head of module
       list (we don't use this field in entries in that list, fortunately).

    [PATCH] /dev/urandom scalability improvement
    
    From: David Mosberger <davidm@napali.hpl.hp.com>
    
    Somebody recently pointed out a performance-anomaly to me where an unusual
    amount of time was being spent reading from /dev/urandom.  The problem
    isn't really surprising as it happened only on >= 4-way machines and the
    random driver isn't terribly scalable the way it is written today.  If
    scalability _really_ mattered, I suppose per-CPU data structures would be
    the way to go.  However, I found that at least for 4-way machines,
    performance can be improved considerably with the attached patch.  In
    particular, I saw the following performance on a 4-way ia64 machine:
    
    Test: 3 tasks running "dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/null bs=1024":
    
    			throughput:

    The patch below adds a few missing put_user()'s to the i810/i830 drm

    annotations indeed found the offender in the function in question.  I've
    kept the sparse __user annotations since those are generally useful anyway.
     I can't test it myself but a few people reported that the oopses went away
    so far.

    [PATCH] Use valid node number when unmapping x86 CPUs
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    From:  colpatch@us.ibm.com
    
    The cpu_2_node[] array for i386 is initialized to all 0's, meaning that
    until modified at CPU bring-up, all CPUs are mapped to node 0.
    
    When CPUs are brought online, they are mapped to the appropriate node by
    various mechanisms, depending on the underlying hardware.
    
    When we unmap CPUs (hotplug time), we should return the mapping for the CPU
    that is going away to its original state, ie: 0.
    
    When this code was initially submitted, the misguided poster (me) made the
    mistake of putting a -1 in the cpu_2_node[] array for the CPU going away.
    
    This patch fixes this mistake, and allows code to get a valid node number
    for all valid CPU numbers.  This is important, because most (if not all)
    callers do not error check the value returned by the cpu_to_node() macro,
    and they should not have to.  The API specifies that a valid node number be
    returned for any valid CPU number.

    [PATCH] Fix genksyms parsing
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    From: Andreas Schwab <schwab@suse.de> I'm getting a warning when building
    for ia64 with MODVERSIONS enabled.  This is a bug in genksyms, it can't
    cope with some arguments of __typeof__.
    
    The following patch will fix that.  Actually the argument of __typeof__ is
    an abstract declarator, but the genksyms parser has no production for that;
    decl_specifier_seq also matches some invalid constructs, but I don't think
    this is a problem in practice, since the compiler will reject them.

    reviewers were bamboozled, others in the future occasionally might be too.

    [PATCH] Fix sys_time() to get subtick correction from the new xtime
    
    From: "La Monte H.P. Yarroll" <piggy@timesys.com>
    
    This is a Scott Wood patch against 2.6.3.
    
    
    Use gettimeofday() rather than xtime.tv_sec in sys_time(), since
    sys_stime() uses settimeofday() and thus subtracts the subtick correction
    from the new xtime.
    
    stime() used settimeofday(), but time() did not use gettimeofday().  Since
    settimeofday() subtracts out the current intra-tick correction, and nsec
    was 0 (since stime() only allows seconds), this resulted in xtime being
    slightly earlier than the time that was set.
    
    If time() had used gettimeofday(), the correction would have been applied,
    and everything would be fine.  However, instead time just reads the current
    xtime.tv_sec, so if time() is called immediately after stime(), you'll
    usually get a value one second earlier.

    [PATCH] add file_operations.fcntl
    
    From: Chuck Lever <cel@citi.umich.edu>
    
    O_DIRECT|O_APPEND cannot possibly work on NFS, so NFS needs some way of
    preventing the user from setting this combination.  We felt that the best
    way of implementing this restriction is to allow the filesytem to implement
    its own fcntl() handler.
    
    This patch does, that, and provide the appropriate handler for NFS.
    
    Additional details from Chuck:
    
    Forgetting O_DIRECT for a moment, O_APPEND writes on NFS don't work in any
    case when multiple clients are writing to a file, since an NFS client can
    never guarantee it knows where the true end of file is 100% of the time.
    it works as expected iff only one client writes to an O_APPEND file at a
    time.
    
    Multi-client O_APPEND writing doesn't seem to be a problem for any
    application I'm aware of.  Since it can be made to behave in the
    multi-client case with careful application logic or by using file locking,
    I don't think we should disallow it.
    
    I want to drop the inode semaphore when doing NFS direct I/O because it is
    synchronous; holding the i_sem means we reduce direct I/O concurrency to
    one I/O per file at a time.  the important thing sct was worried about was
    the case where a single client is writing with O_APPEND and O_DIRECT, and
    we don't hold the i_sem during the write.
    
    We must at least hold the i_sem when determining where the end of file is
    to do the O_APPEND write.  In 2.6, I believe that is handled correctly in
    the VFS layer, so this is not an issue for 2.6, right?

    [PATCH] sb_mixer bounds checking
    
    From: Muli Ben-Yehuda <mulix@mulix.org>
    
    This patch add proper bounds checking to the sb_mixer.c code, found by the
    stanford checker[0].  It fixes bugzilla bugs 252[1], 253[2] and 254[3].
    Patch is against 2.6.5-rc2.  It was tested by Rene Herman on SN AWE64 gold
    and sound still works.  The issue was previously discussed on lkml[4], but
    apparently no fix was applied.
    
    The patch is a bit more intrusive than I would've liked, but I don't think
    it can be helped without really intrusive changes.  sb_devc has a pointer
    to an array (iomap) that is set at run time to point to arrays of variable
    sizes.  The patch adds an 'iomap_sz' member to sb_devc that is set to the
    length of the array, and does bounds checking in sb_common_mixer_set() and
    smw_mixer_set() agains that.

    [PATCH] slab: updates for per-arch alignments
    
    From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
    
    Description:
    
    Right now kmem_cache_create automatically decides about the alignment of
    allocated objects. The automatic decisions are sometimes wrong:
    
    - for some objects, it's better to keep them as small as possible to
      reduce the memory usage.  Ingo already added a parameter to
      kmem_cache_create for the sigqueue cache, but it wasn't implemented.
    
    - for s390, normal kmalloc must be 8-byte aligned.  With debugging
      enabled, the default allocation was 4-bytes.  This means that s390 cannot
      enable slab debugging.
    
    - arm26 needs 1 kB aligned objects.  Previously this was impossible to
      generate, therefore arm has its own allocator in
      arm26/machine/small_page.c
    
    - most objects should be cache line aligned, to avoid false sharing.  But
      the cache line size was set at compile time, often to 128 bytes for
      generic kernels.  This wastes memory.  The new code uses the runtime
      determined cache line size instead.
    
    - some caches want an explicit alignment.  One example are the pte_chain
      objects: they must find the start of the object with addr&mask.  Right
      now pte_chain objects are scaled to the cache line size, because that was
      the only alignment that could be generated reliably.
    
    The implementation reuses the "offset" parameter of kmem_cache_create and
    now uses it to pass in the requested alignment.  offset was ignored by the
    current implementation, and the only user I found is sigqueue, which
    intended to set the alignment.
    
    In the long run, it might be interesting for the main tree: due to the 128
    byte alignment, only 7 inodes fit into one page, with 64-byte alignment, 9
    inodes - 20% memory recovered for Athlon systems.
    
    
    
    For generic kernels  running on P6 cpus (i.e. 32 byte cachelines), it means
    
    Number of objects per page:
    
     ext2_inode_cache: 8 instead of 7
     ext3_inode_cache: 8 instead of 7
     fat_inode_cache: 9 instead of 7
     rpc_tasks: 24 instead of 15
     tcp_tw_bucket: 40 instead of 30
     arp_cache: 40 instead of 30
     nfs_write_data: 9 instead of 7

    [PATCH] readv/writev range checking fix
    
    do-readv_writev() is trying to fail if
    
    a) any of the segments have a length < 0 or
    
    b) the sum of the segments wraps negative.
    
    But it gets b) wrong because local variable tot_len is unsigned.
    
    Fix that up.

    [PATCH] jbd: fix I/O error handling
    
    Fix a few buglets spotted by Jeff Mahoney <jeffm@suse.com>.  We're currently
    only checking for I/O errors against journal buffers if they were locked when
    they were first inspected.
    
    We need to check buffer_uptodate() even if the buffers were already unlocked.

    [PATCH] JBD: ordered-data commit cleanup
    
    For data=ordered, kjournald at commit time has to write out and wait upon a
    long list of buffers.  It does this in a rather awkward way with a single
    list.  it causes complexity and long lock hold times, and makes the addition
    of rescheduling points quite hard
    
    So what we do instead (based on Chris Mason's suggestion) is to add a new
    buffer list (t_locked_list) to the journal.  It contains buffers which have
    been placed under I/O.
    
    So as we walk the t_sync_datalist list we move buffers over to t_locked_list
    as they are written out.
    
    When t_sync_datalist is empty we may then walk t_locked_list waiting for the
    I/O to complete.
    
    As a side-effect this means that we can remove the nasty synchronous wait in
    journal_dirty_data which is there to avoid the kjournald livelock which would
    otherwise occur when someone is continuously dirtying a buffer.

    [PATCH] jbd: fix ordered-data writeout logic
    
    There's some nasty code in commit which deals with a lock ranking problem.
    Currently if it fails to get the lock when and local variable `bufs' is zero
    we forget to write out some ordered-data buffers.  So a subsequent
    crash+recovery could yield stale data in existing files.
    
    Fix it by correctly restarting the t_sync_datalist search.

    [PATCH] speed up ext2 fsync() and fdatasync()
    
    ext2_sync_file() forgets to clear the inode's dirty bits, so we write the
    inode on every fsync(), even if it hasn't changed.
    
    Fix that up via the new sync_file() API which correctly manages the inode
    state bits and the superblock inode lists.
    
    When performing file overwrite on IDE with and without writeback caching
    enabled this patch approximately doubles fsync() speed, bringing it into line
    with O_SYNC writes.
    
    Also, fix up the return value handling in ext2_sync_file().

    [PATCH] ext3 fsync() and fdatasync() speedup
    
    ext3's fsync/fdatasync implementation is currently syncing the inode via a
    full journal commit even if it was unaltered.
    
    Fix that up by exporting the core VFS's inode sync function to modules and
    calling it if the inode is dirty.  We need to do it this way so that the
    inode is moved to the appropriate superblock list and so that the i_state
    dirty flags are appropriately updated.
    
    This speeds up ext3 fsync() for file overwrites by a factor of four (disk
    non-writeback) to forty (disk in writeback mode).

    From: Martin Hicks <mort@wildopensource.com>
    
    This changes __alloc_pages() so it uses precalculated values for the "min".
    This should prevent the problem of min incrementing from zone to zone across
    many nodes on a NUMA machine.  The result of falling back to other nodes with
    the old incremental min calculations was that the min value became very
    large.

    - Add support for messaging through an IPMI LAN interface, which is
      required for some system software that already exists on other IPMI
      drivers.  It also does some renaming and a lot of little cleanups.
    
    - Add the "System Interface" driver.  The previous driver for system
      interfaces only supported the KCS interface, this driver supports all
      system interfaces defined in the IPMI standard.  It also does a much better
      job of handling ACPI and SMBIOS tables for detecting IPMI system
      interfaces.

    [PATCH] compat emulation for posix message queues
    
    From: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>
    
    I have tested the code with the open posix test suite and found the same
    four failures for both 64-bit and compat mode, most tests pass.  The patch
    is against -mc1, but I guess it also applies to the other trees around.
    
    What worries me more than mq_attr compatibility is the conversion of struct
    sigevent, which might turn out really hard when more fields in there are
    used.  AFAICS, the only other part in the kernel ABI is sys_timer_create(),
    so maybe it's not too late to deprecate the current structure and create a
    structure that can be used properly for compat syscalls.

    [PATCH] posix message queues: send notifications via netlink
    
    From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
    
    SIGEV_THREAD means that a given callback should be called in the context on a
    new thread.  This must be done by the C library.  The kernel must deliver a
    notice of the event to the C library when the callback should be called.
    
    This patch switches to a new, simpler interface: User space creates a socket
    with socket(PF_NETLINK, SOCK_RAW,0) and passes the fd to the mq_notify call
    together with a cookie.  When the mq_notify() condition is satisfied, the
    kernel "writes" the cookie to the socket.  User space then reads the cookie
    and calls the appropriate callback.

    [PATCH] split netlink_unicast
    
    From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
    
    The attached patch splits netlink_unicast into three steps:
    
    - netlink_getsock{bypid,byfilp}: lookup the destination socket.
    
    - netlink_attachskb: perform the nonblock checks, sleep if the socket
      queue is longer than the limit, etc.
    
    - netlink_sendskb: actually send the skb.
    
    jamal looked over it and didn't see a problem with the netlink change.  The
    actual use from ipc/mqueue.c is still open (just send back whatever the C
    library passed to mq_notify, add an nlmsghdr or perhaps even make it a
    specialized netlink protocol), but the attached patch is independant from
    the the message queue change.

    [PATCH] posix message queue update
    
    From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
    
    My discussion with Ulrich had one result:
    
    - mq_setattr can accept implementation defined flags.  Right now we have
      none, but we might add some later (e.g.  switch to CLOCK_MONOTONIC for
      mq_timed{send,receive} or something similar).  When we add flags, we
      might need the fields for additional information.  And they don't hurt.
      Therefore add four __reserved fields to mq_attr.
    
    - fail mq_setattr if we get unknown flags - otherwise glibc can't detect
      if it's running on a future kernel that supports new features.
    
    - use memset to initialize the mq_attr structure - theoretically we could
      leak kernel memory.
    
    - Only set O_NONBLOCK in mq_attr, explicitely clear O_RDWR & friends.
      openposix uses getattr, attr |=O_NONBLOCK, setattr - a sane approach.
      Without clearing O_RDWR, this fails.
    
    I've retested all openposix conformance tests with the new patch - the two
    new FAILED tests check undefined behavior.  Note that I won't have net
    access until Sunday - if the message queue patch breaks something important
    either ask Krzysztof or drop it.
    
    Ulrich had another good idea for SIGEV_THREAD, but I must think about it.
    It would mean less complexitiy in glibc, but more code in the kernel.  I'm
    not yet convinced that it's overall better.

    Make the posix message queue mountable by the user.  This replaces ipcs and

    and remove stale queues with rm.
    
    I'd like a final confirmation from Ulrich that our SIGEV_THREAD approach is
    the right thing(tm): He's aware of the design and didn't object, but I think
    he hasn't seen the final API yet.

    [PATCH] posix message queues: implementation
    
    From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
    
    Actual implementation of the posix message queues, written by Krzysztof
    Benedyczak and Michal Wronski.  The complete implementation is dependant on
    CONFIG_POSIX_MQUEUE.
    
    It passed the openposix test suite with two exceptions: one mq_unlink test
    was bad and tested undefined behavior.  And Linux succeeds
    mq_close(open(,,,)).  The spec mandates EBADF, but we have decided to ignore
    that: we would have to add a new syscall just for the right error code.
    
    The patch intentionally doesn't use all helpers from fs/libfs for kernel-only
    filesystems: step 5 allows user space mounts of the file system.
    
    
    
    Signal changes:
    
    The patch redefines SI_MESGQ using __SI_CODE: The generic Linux ABI uses
    a negative value (i.e.  from user) for SI_MESGQ, but the kernel internal
    value must be posive to pass check_kill_value.  Additionally, the patch
    adds support into copy_siginfo_to_user to copy the "new" signal type to
    user space.
    
    
    
    Changes in signal code caused by POSIX message queues patch:
    
    General & rationale:
    
      mqueues generated signals (only upon notification) must have si_code
      == SI_MESGQ.  In fact such a signal is send from one process which
      caused notification (== sent message to empty message queue) to
      another which requested it.  Both processes can be of course unrelated
      in terms of uids/euids.  So SI_MESGQ signals must be classified as
      SI_FROMKERNEL to pass check_kill_permissions (not need to say that
      this signals ARE from kernel).
    
      Signals generated by message queues notification need the same
      fields in siginfo struct's union _sifields as POSIX.1b signals and we
      can reuse its union entry.
    
      SI_MESGQ was previously defined to -3 in kernel and also in glibc.
      So in userspace SI_MESGQ must be still visible as -3.
    
    Solution:
    
      SI_MESGQ is defined in the same style as SI_TIMER using __SI_CODE macro.
    
      Details:
    
        Fortunately copy_siginfo_to_user copies si_code as short.  So we
        can use remaining part of int value freely.  __SI_CODE does the
        work.  SI_MESGQ is in kernel:
    
     		6<<16 | (-3 & 0xffff) what is > 0
    
        but to userspace is copied
    
     		(short) SI_MESGQ == -3
    
    Actual changes:
    
      Changes in include/asm-generic/siginfo.h
    
      __SI_MESGQ added in signal.h to represent inside-kernel prefix of
      SI_MESGQ.  SI_MESGQ is redefined from -3 to __SI_CODE(__SI_MESGQ, -3)
    
      Except mips architecture those changes should be arch independent
      (asm-generic/siginfo.h is included in arch versions).  On mips
      SI_MESGQ is redefined to -4 in order to be compatible with IRIX.  But
      the same schema can be used.
    
      Change in copy_siginfo_to_user: We only add one line to order the
      same copy semantics as for _SI_RT.
    
      This change isn't very portable - some arch have its own
      copy_siginfo_to_user.  All those should have similar change (but
      possibly not one-line as _SI_RT case was sometimes ignored because i
      wasn't used yet, e.g.  see ia64 signal.c).
    
    Update:
    mq: only fail with invalid timespec if mq_timed{send,receive} needs to block
    From: Jakub Jelinek <jakub@redhat.com>
    
    POSIX requires EINVAL to be set if:
    "The process or thread would have blocked, and the abs_timeout parameter
    specified a nanoseconds field value less than zero or greater than or equal
    to 1000 million."
    but 2.6.5-mm3 returns -EINVAL even if the process or thread would not block
    (if the queue is not empty for timedreceive or not full for timedsend).

    [PATCH] posix message queues: syscall stubs
    
    From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
    
    Add -ENOSYS stubs for the posix message queue syscalls.  The API is a direct
    mapping of the api from the unix spec, with two exceptions:
    
    - mq_close() doesn't exist.  Message queue file descriptors can be closed
      with close().
    
    - mq_notify(SIGEV_THREAD) cannot be implemented in the kernel.  The kernel
      returns a pollable file descriptor .  User space must poll (or read) this
      descriptor and call the notifier function if the file descriptor is
      signaled.

    - they belong into a header file.
    
    - create a new msgutil.c with the helper functions for message queues.

    [PATCH] md: merge_bvec_fn needs to know about partitions.
    
    From: Neil Brown <neilb@cse.unsw.edu.au>
    
    Addresses http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2355
    
    It seems that a merge_bvec_fn needs to be aware of partitioning...  who
    would have thought it :-(
    
    The following patch should fix the merge_bvec_fn for both linear and raid0.
    We teach linear and raid0 about partitions in the merge_bvec_fn.
    
    ->merge_bvec_fn needs to make decisions based on the physical geometry of the
    device.  For raid0, it needs to decide if adding the bvec to the bio will
    make the bio span two drives.
    
    To do this, it needs to know where the request is (what the sector number is)
    in the whole device.
    
    However when called from bio_add_page, bi_sector is the sector number
    relative to the current partition, as generic_make_request hasn't been called
    yet.
    
    So raid_mergeable_bvec needs to map bio->bi_sector (which is partition
    relative) to a bi_sector which is device relative, so it can perform proper
    calculations about when chunk boundaries are.

    The first 2 are already supported on the client; this adds integrity support

    [PATCH] search for /init for initramfs boots
    
    From: Olaf Hering <olh@suse.de>
    
    initramfs can not be used in current 2.6 kernels, the files will never be
    executed because prepare_namespace doesn't care about them.  The only way to
    workaround that limitation is a root=0:0 cmdline option to force rootfs as
    root filesystem.  This will break further booting because rootfs is not the
    final root filesystem.
    
    This patch checks for the presence of /init which comes from the cpio archive
    (and thats the only way to store files into the rootfs).  This binary/script
    has to do all the work of prepare_namespace().

    [PATCH] Quota locking fixes
    
    From: Jan Kara <jack@ucw.cz>
    
    Change locking rules in quota code to fix lock ordering especially wrt
    journal lock.  Also some unnecessary spinlocking is removed.  The locking
    changes are mainly: dqptr_sem, dqio_sem are acquired only when transaction is
    already started, dqonoff_sem before a transaction is started.  This change
    requires some callbacks to ext3 (also implemented in this patch) to start
    transaction before the locks are acquired.

    the functions.  After looking further they are redundant and not
    used anywhere at all.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Move EPOW log buffer to BSS
    
    From: Olof Johansson <olof@austin.ibm.com>
    
    RTAS on IBM pSeries runs in real mode, so all pointers being passed in to
    it need to be in low memory.  There's two places in the RAS code that
    passes in pointers to items on the stack, which might end up being above
    the limit.
    
    Below patch resolves this by creating a buffer in BSS + a lock for
    serialization.  There's no reason to worry about contention on the lock,
    since rtas_call() also serializes on a single spinlock and this is an
    infrequent code path in the first place.

    [PATCH] ppc64: allow hugepages anywhere in low 4GB
    
    From: David Gibson <david@gibson.dropbear.id.au>
    
    On PPC64, to deal with the restrictions imposed by the PPC MMU's segment
    design, hugepages are only allowed to be mapping in two fixed address
    ranges, one 2-3G (for use by 32-bit processes) and one 1-1.5T (for use in
    64-bit processes).  This is quite limiting, particularly for 32-bit
    processes which want to use a lot of large page memory.
    
    This patch relaxes this restriction, and allows any of the low 16 segments
    (i.e.  those below 4G) to be individually switched over to allow hugepage
    mappings (provided the segment does not already have any normal page
    mappings).  The 1-1.5T fixed range for 64-bit processes remains.

    Unfortunately, Anton is about to submit some other patches of mine which
    will sightly comflict with this.  I will send a patch shortly that will
    (hopefully) fix that.

    [PATCH] disable VT on iSeries by default
    
    From: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>
    
    This patch from Julie DeWandel makes CONFIG_VT default to N on iSeries
    machines which are using the iSeries virtual console driver viocons.c.  The
    VT console and the viocons code can't coexist because they use the same tty
    numbers, that is, viocons supplies /dev/tty1.  Without this patch the user
    has to figure out somehow that s/he has to turn on CONFIG_EMBEDDED in order
    to be able to turn off CONFIG_VT, which is really very non-obvious.

    A recent patch that cleaned up some absolute/virt translation macros forgot
    one occurence, thus breaking g5 build with iommu support.

    From: Olof Johansson <olof@austin.ibm.com>
    
    A bug snuck in during the rewrite of ppc64 IOMMU code.  When a
    {pci,vio}_alloc_consistent() call fails, DMA_ERROR_CODE is returned instead
    of NULL.

    [PATCH] ppc64: hugepage bugfix
    
    From: David Gibson <david@gibson.dropbear.id.au>
    
    Found this again while looking at hugepage extensions.  Haven't actually had
    it bite yet - the race is small and the other bug will never be triggered in
    32-bit processes, and the function is rarely called on 64-bit processes.
    
    This patch fixes two bugs in the (same part of the) PPC64 hugepage code.
    First the method we were using to free stale PTE pages was not safe with some
    recent changes (race condition).  BenH has fixed this to work in the new way.
     Second, we were not checking for a valid PGD entry before dereferencing the
    PMD page when scanning for stale PTE page pointers.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix bug in hugepage support
    
    From: David Gibson <david@gibson.dropbear.id.au>
    
    The PPC64 version of is_aligned_hugepage_range() is buggy.  It is supposed to
    test not only that the given range is hugepage aligned, but that it lies
    within the address space allowed for hugepages.  We were checking only that
    the given range intersected the hugepage range, not that it lay entirely
    within it.  This patch fixes the problem and changes the name of some macros
    to make it less likely to make that misunderstanding again.

    [PATCH] Fix get_wchan() FIXME wrt. order of functions
    
    From: William Lee Irwin III <wli@holomorphy.com>
    
    This addresses the issue with get_wchan() that the various functions acting
    as scheduling-related primitives are not, in fact, contiguous in the text
    segment.  It creates an ELF section for scheduling primitives to be placed
    in, and places currently-detected (i.e.  skipped during stack decoding)
    scheduling primitives and others like io_schedule() and down(), which are
    currently missed by get_wchan() code, into this section also.
    
    The net effects are more reliability of get_wchan()'s results and the new
    ability, made use of by this code, to arbitrarily place scheduling
    primitives in the source code without disturbing get_wchan()'s accuracy.
    
    Suggestions by Arnd Bergmann and Matthew Wilcox regarding reducing the
    invasiveness of the patch were incorporated during prior rounds of review.
    I've at least tried to sweep all arches in this patch.

    [PATCH] i4l: kernelcapi receive workqueue and locking rework
    
    From: Armin Schindler <armin@melware.de>
    
    With this patch the ISDN kernel CAPI code uses a per application workqueue
    with proper locking to prevent message re-ordering due to the fact a
    workqueue may run on another CPU at the same time.  Also some locks for
    internal data is added.
    
    Removed global recv_queue work, use per application workqueue.  Added
    proper locking mechanisms for application, controller and application
    workqueue function.  Increased max.  number of possible applications and
    controllers.

    [PATCH] Fix VT open/close race
    
    The race is that con_close() can sleep, and drops the BKL while
    tty->count==1.  But another thread can come into init_dev() and will take a
    new ref against the tty and start using it.
    
    But con_close() doesn't notice that new ref and proceeds to null out
    tty->driver_data while someone else is using the resurrected tty.
    
    So the patch serialises con_close() against init_dev() with tty_sem.
    
    
    Here's a test app which reproduced the oops instantly on 2-way.  It realy
    needs to be run against all tty-capable devices.
    
    /*
     * Run this against a tty which nobody currently has open, such as /dev/tty9
     */

    	fd = open(filename, O_RDWR);
    	if (fd < 0) {
    		perror("open");
    		exit(1);
    	}
    	ioctl(fd, KDKBDREP, &x);
    	close(fd);
    }
    
    main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
    	char *filename = argv[1];
    
    	for ( ; ; )
    		doit(filename);

    [PATCH] remove down_tty_sem()
    
    Remove the down_tty_sem() and up_tty_sem() and replace them with open-coded
    up() and down().  This is an equivalent transformation.
    
    I assume these functions were created to open the possibility of per-tty
    semaphores at some time in the future.  But the code which is protected by
    this lock deals with two tty's at the same time, and the next patch will need
    to release the lock after the tty has been destroyed.

    [PATCH] con_open() speedup/cleanup
    
    con_open() is called on every open of the tty, even if the tty is already all
    set up.  We only need to do that initialisation if the tty is being set up
    for the very first time (tty->count == 1).
    
    So do that: check for tty_count == 1 inside console_sem() and if so, bypass
    all the unnecessary initialisation.
    
    
    
    Note that this patch reintroduces the con_close()-vs-init_dev() race+oops.
    This is because that oops is accidentally prevented because when it happens,
    con_open() reinstalls tty->driver_data even when tty->count > 1.
    
    But that's bogus, and when the race happens we end up running
    vcs_make_devfs() and vcs_remove_devfs() against the same console at the same
    time, producing indeterminate results.
    
    So the race needs to be fixed again, for real.

    [PATCH] generalise system_running
    
    From: Olof Johansson <olof@austin.ibm.com>
    
    It's currently a boolean, but that means that system_running goes to zero
    again when shutting down.  So we then use code (in the page allocator) which
    is only designed to be used during bootup - it is marked __init.
    
    So we need to be able to distinguish early boot state from late shutdown
    state.  Rename system_running to system_state and give it the three
    appropriate states.

      portmap can fail due to the call to xprt_close() in xprt_connect():
        xprt_disconnect() wakes up xprt->snd_task, and sets -ENOTCONN,

      Fix is to remove call to xprt_disconnect(). We don't need it in the

      wake up xprt->snd_task if reconnection fails.

Date:   Sat Apr 10 21:19:27 2004 -0700

    RPC: add fair queueing to the RPC scheduler.
    If a wait queue is defined as a "priority queue" then requests are dequeued
    in blocks of 16 in order to work well with write gathering + readahead on the
    server.
    There are 3 levels of priority. The high priority tasks get scheduled 16 times
    for each time the default level gets scheduled. The lowest level gets
    scheduled once every 4 times the normal level gets scheduled.
    Original patch contributed by Shantanu Goel.

    [PCMCIA] Use kernel resource core as primary resource allocator.
    
    Turn the resource management on its head.  Rather than using PCMCIA's
    resource database as the primary object to allocate resources, use
    Linux's standard resource allocation instead.
    
    When we have a socket on a PCI bus, we always use the PCI resource
    allocation functions rather than the kernels core resource allocation,
    so that we can take account of any bridges.

    [PCMCIA] Fix resource handling for memory probe
    
    Add claim_region and free_region to claim/free resource regions.
    This ensures that we only attempt to probe memory regions which
    are directly related to the socket in question, rather than any
    memory region we happen to be able to request.
    
    This also fixes a memory leak where we don't kfree the resources
    we previously allocated.

    This calls into the 8250 driver so that the serial port settings can

    have assumed that the port will be re-opened after such an event,
    which may not be the case.

    Convert sr to a kref and fix sr_open/sr_remove race
    
    We actually fix this race by mediating the object release/get race
    (i.e. we destroy the scsi_cd object when its reference count goes
    1->0, we use a semaphore to prevent something else trying to get a
    reference after or during this).
    
    The open/remove race is actually irrelevant because even if we open an
    already removed object, all that will happen is that we get a
    reference to a device that always returns EIO.

    [Bluetooth] Fix race in RX complete routine of the USB drivers
    
    The test of the HCI_RUNNING flags bit in the RX complete routine should

    on SMP systems in which RX complete finds the bit is set and on another
    processor the close routine clears the bit, grabs and releases the lock
    and then unlinks all the active URB's. Then the first processor acquires
    the lock and resubmits the URB.

    Please find below a patch against kernel 2.6.5-rc2-mm4 to add the pcf8591
    driver (a 8-bit A/D and D/A converter). I have ported it from the 2.4
    version, and it includes some fixes, improvements and simplifications.
    
    It has been reviewed by Jean Delvare on IRC.
    
    Please also note that the patch also fixes a missing space in
    drivers/i2c/chips/Kconfig, introduced by the previous patch I sent you
    concerning the pcf8574.

    lightly tested by one user.
    
    This patch also suggests some code cleanups (fan code refactoring). I'll
    send a different patch later for these.

    [Bluetooth] Fix URB unlink race in the USB drivers
    
    The code in hci_usb_unlink_urbs() calls usb_unlink_urb() to perform a
    synchronous unlink of each pending URB. It then moves each URB to the
    completed list, and then frees everything on the completed list. By doing
    this, the code implicitly assumes that when usb_unlink_urb() returns the
    URB will have completed and be ready to be deallocated. That's not always
    true. The same applies to the BlueFRITZ! USB driver.

    Patch from Marc Singer
    
    As suggested by Russell, we add a barrier() before returning from

    floating point support in the kernel.  Without this change, the
    backtrace reported an error.
    
    It is possible that this change has already been made.  I don't see it
    in any of the applied patches that I can read.

    [PATCH] ia64: perfmon update
    
    Here is a new perfmon patch. It is important because it
    fixes the problem of the close() when the file descriptor
    is shared between two related processes. The good thing
    is that it simplifies a lot the cleanup of the sampling
    buffer.
    
    Here is the ChangeLog:
    
    - fix bug in pfm_close() when the descriptor is
      shared between related processed. Introduce
      a pfm_flush() called for each invocation of
      close(). pfm_close() only called for the last
      user.
    
    - fix pfm_restore_monitoring() to also reload
      the debug registers. They could be modified
      while monitoring is masked.
    
    - fix pfm_close() to clear ctx_fl_is_sampling.
    
    - fix a bug in pfm_handle_work() which could cause
      the wrong PMD to be reset.
    
    - converted PROTECT_CTX/UNPROTECT_CTX into
      local_irq_save/restore to keep context protection
      but allow IPI to proceed.
    
    - updated pfm_syswide_force_stop() to use
      local_irq_save/restore now that the context
      is protected from the caller side.
    
    - updated pfm_mck_pmc_check() to check if context is
      loaded before checking for special IBR/DBR combinations.
      Clearing the debug registers is not needed when the context
      is not yet loaded.
    
    - updated perfmon.h to have to correct prototype definitions
      for the pfm_mod_*() functions.
    
    - got rid of the PFM_CTX_TERMINATED state.
    
    - cleanup the DPRINT() statements to remove
      explicit output of current->pid. This is done
       systematically by the macros.
    
    - added a systctl entry (expert_mode) to bypass
      read/write checks on PMC/PMD. As its name indicates
      this is for experts ONLY. Must be root to toggle
      /proc/sys entry.
    
    - corrected pfm_mod_*() to check against the current task.
    
    - removed pfm_mod_fast_read_pmds(). It is never needed.
    
    - added pfm_mod_write_ibrs() and pfm_mod_write_dbrs().

    change goes in, dev->irq won't be initialized until *after*
    acpi_pci_irq_enable().

    I would clean it up and get it upstream.

    [AGPGART] Fix SiS 746 again.
    Turns out that this chipset won't work in AGPv3 mode with the generic AGPv3 routines.
    *somehow*, it works in AGPv3 mode with AGPv2 aperture sizing etc. Very, very strange.
    Still, until we get some docs from SiS, some support is better than none.

    [Bluetooth] Allocate the BCM203x URB buffer seperately
    
    The buffer shares cachelines with other fields of the structure. On
    architectures which require synchronisation before or after doing DMA
    to or from a buffer, any access to such fields sharing cachelines can
    corrupt the content of the buffer. The allocation primitives guarantee
    that cachelines are not shared.

    received until the descriptor of the last packet has been sent (with
    interrupts disabled btw).

    - use the higher 32 bits of addresses for the Rx/Tx buffers.

    [SCTP] Use id to ptr translation service in lib/idr.c to assign and

    This patch avoids the use of virt_addr_valid() to validate the address
    of associations passed by the user. Currently the address of an
    association is used as its id. virt_addr_valid doesn't work as
    expected when PAGEALLOC debugging is enabled.

    Patch from Hugh Dickins
    
    In wandering through the Linus 2.6 tree preparing for changeover of
    i_mmap and i_mmap_shared to Rajesh's prio tree for object-based rmap...
    I noticed that pgoff in make_coherent doesn't add up (plus, I think
    we need to mask out the word "don't" in the comment further down).
    2.4.25 looks equally wrong.

    [CPUFREQ] Transmeta longrun driver fix.
    (From Stelian Pop)
    Upon investigation, the reason is that trying to set the performance
    to 80% in longrun_determine_freqs leaves the performance to 100%.
    The performance level, at least on this particular model, can be lowered
    only in 33% steps. And in order to put the performance to 66%, the
    code should try to set the barrier to 70%.
    
    The following patch does even more, it tries every value from 80%
    to 10% in 10% steps, until it succeeds in lowering the performance.
    I'm not sure this is the best way to do it but in any case,
    it works for me (and should continue to work for everybody else).

    [NET]: Update networking config menu (v3)
    
    Networking support/options and Networking drivers have been, uhm,
    messy to navigate for some time now.   BenH mentioned this
    and I was already looking into options to clean it up.
    
    This is a cleanup of Networking support/options and Networking Drivers.
    It presents a more consistent interface and lists similar driver
    groups and protocol groups closer together.
    It also moves the IBMVETH driver so that it no longer breaks the
    dependency tree, allowing other drivers (nearby in Kconfig file)
    to be presented in a more linear manner.

    [PATCH] SCSI sense buffer size -> 96
    
    some SCSI devices need more than 64bytes of sense buffer.
    I know about one: The IBM MagStar tapes report the necessity to be
    cleaned at bytes 70 and report 96 bytes in total.
    
    Attached patch increases the sense buffer size to 96 bytes.

    [PATCH] sd_shutdown cannot be called when in state SDEV_DEL
    
    sd_remove calls sd_shutdown to finish I/O to the disc.  However, the
    state model puts the device in SDEV_DEL before triggering the
    sd_remove (which won't allow any further I/O at all).
    
    Fix by making SDEV_CANCEL the intermediate state and only transitioning to
    SDEV_DEL after calling device_del().

    [PATCH] USB: usbcore blinkenlights
    
    The per-port LEDs on the most USB 2.0 hubs are programmable.
    And the USB spec describes some ways to use them, blinking
    to alert users about hardware (amber) or software (green)
    problems.
    
    This patch is the infrastructure for that blinking.  And
    if you should happen to "modprobe usbcore blinkenlights",
    the LEDs will cycle through all the ports ... which is
    not a USB-standard mode, but it can certainly handy be
    handy as a system heartbeat visible across the room.

    Bridge code is limited to 256 ports per bridge because the Spanning

    fixes:
    	* bogus unlock in error path when port list is full.
    	* passes different error status for out of memory, vs
    	  port list full.
    	* O(n) vs O(n^2) lookup for free port number
    	* since port and priority are both limited to one byte
    	  don't store them as int's
    	* makes limit explicit in code

    passes 0 for the third argument, and expects 256 entries.
    
    Note: there still is limit of 256 ports due to STP, but this
    shouldn't show up in the API, it needs to be handled by the
    'add port to bridge ioctl'.

    [libata sata_via] Fix detection of device 1
    
    VIA hardware thinks port 1 (second port) is "SATA primary slave".
    Since the hardware rarely configures SATA to present as slave devices,
    we must pretend that the second hardware port (as the user sees it)
    is the third port (as the VIA PCI config registers see it).

    [PATCH] PCI: Allow arch-specific pci_set_dma_mask and friends
    
    The patch provides the ability for architectures to have custom
    implementations of pci_set_dma_mask() and friends (dac_set_dma_mask
    and set_consistent_dma_mask). The reason I need this is b/c I have
    a chipset (Intel ARM IXP425) that has a broken PCI interface that
    only allows PCI dma to/from the bottom 64MB of system memory.  To get
    around this limitation, I trap a custom dma-mapping implementation that
    bounces buffers outside the 64MB window. At device discover time, my
    custom platform_notify() function gets called and it sets the dma_mask
    to (64MB-1) and in ARM's dma-mapping code, I check for dma_mask != 0xffffffff
    and if that is true, I call the special bounce helpers. This works great
    except that certain drivers (e100, ide-pci) call pci_set_dma_mask()
    with 0xffffffff and the generic implementation only allows for the
    architecture-defined pci_dma_supported() to return true or false. There
    is no method for the architecture to tell the PCI layer "I can't set
    the mask to 0xffffffff, but I can set it to this other value" and there
    is no way to pass that back to the driver. What this means is that if
    I have pci_set_dma_supported() return failure on full 32-bit DMA, the
    driver will not initialize the card; however, if I return true,
    pci_set_dma_mask() will set the dma mask to full 32-bits and I can no
    longer trap and will have buffers that are not dma-able and cause
    PCI master aborts.  Both of those are not acceptable.  IMHO, the
    driver shouldn't care if the architecture has to bounce DMA outside of
    64MB and since this is not something most architectures have to worry
    about, the easiest way to get around the issue is by allowing custom
    pci_set_dma_mask() for arches that need it but keeping the generic
    implementation for those that do not.  In my case, it simply returns
    0 to the driver but keeps the device mask set to 64MB-1 so I can trap.

    [PATCH] USB Gadget: Rename the dummy_hcd's gadget
    
    When David added an entry to the gadget_chips.h file for the dummy_hcd
    driver, he mistakenly used the name "dummy_udc" rather than "dummy_hcd".
    The mistake is understandable, since other controllers use "_udc" in their
    names and it is illogical to put "_hcd" in a _device_ controller's name.
    
    This patch updates the dummy_hcd driver and changes the gadget name to
    agree with the gadget_chips.h entry.

    The first part makes it use usb_reset_configuration() like
    it did before ... I'm surprised this driver hasn't been
    generating "it deadlocks during probe" reports.
    
    The second part prints a diagnostic if the configuration
    wasn't set right; the fix would use hotplug and sysfs.

    [PATCH] I2C: Prevent misdetections in adm1021 driver
    
    Yet another patch for the adm1021 chip driver. I refined the detection
    code a bit in order to prevent chip misdetection. Some chips handled
    by the adm1021 driver are hard to detect and identify (LM84 and
    MAX1617) so we tend to accept any chip it the valid I2C address range
    as one of these. It has caused much, much trouble already. See these
    threads for example:
    
    http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg04448.html
    http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg04624.html
    http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg05560.html
    http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg05871.html
    http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg06754.html
    http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg07181.html
    
    And this ticket:
    
    http://www2.lm-sensors.nu/~lm78/readticket.cgi?ticket=1434
    
    So I thought it would be good to prevent this kind of problems if
    possible, and read the 8 datasheets again in search for ways to refine
    the detection method.
    
    I changed it in sensors-detect already, and had positive feedback from
    one user. I will also backport the changes to the driver to the 2.4
    version we have in CVS.
    
    What the patch does:
    
    * Use unused bits of two more registers (configuration and conversion
    rate) to reduce misdetections.
    
    * Return with -ENODEV if the detection fails.
    
    * Change the order in which we try to identify the chips. We better
    finish with the LM84 and the MAX1617, in this order, because they are
    harder to identify and are more likely to result in false positives.
    
    * Refine LM84 detection. The LM84 has less features than the other
    chips(chip cannot be stopped, conversion rate cannot be set, no low
    limits) so it has extra unused bits.
    
    * Do not intialize the chip if it was detected as an LM84. This one
    cannot be stopped so why would we try to start it again? And as said
    right before, conversion rate isn't changeable either.
    
    Note that I couldn't test the changes on any supported chip since I
    don't own any. Still I believe that they should be applied, since the
    current code already broke one system and seriously harmed several
    others. I believe it's not critical if it turns out that we reject
    valid chips (which shouldn't happen if the datasheets are correct,
    anyway). People will simply let us know and we'll be less restrictive.
    In the meantime they can force the driver. That said, testers are
    welcome, as usual.

    [PATCH] USB Storage: datafab fix and unusual devices
    
    datafab.c has an often-seen bug: the SCSI READ_CAPACITY command
    does not need the number of sectors but the last sector.
    
    I just tried the CF and SM parts of a 5-in-1 card reader.
    The CF part works with US_PR_DATAFAB when the bug mentioned is fixed.
    The SM part works with US_PR_SDDR55.
    (Revision Number is 17.08 - that in case the 0000-ffff
    should prove to be too optimistic.)
    
    We still must discuss what setup to use for readers like this -
    I have several of them - that require different drivers for
    different LUNs. As it is now one has to compile usb-storage
    twice, once with CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_DATAFAB defined and once
    without, and remove one usb-storage.ko and insert the other
    to go from CF to SM. (And that hangs with 2.6.4 so a reboot
    is required..)

    [PATCH] USB: set_configuration locking cleanups
    
    I've posted all these before, the only notable change is
    treating that one gphoto2 case as warn-and-continue rather
    than return-with-failure.
    
    
    usb_set_configuration() cleanup
    
     * Remove it from the USB kernel driver API.  No drivers need it now,
       and the sysadmin can change bConfigurationValue using sysfs (say,
       when hotplugging an otherwise problematic device).
    
     * Simpler/cleaner locking:  caller must own dev->serialize.
    
     * Access from usbfs now uses usb_reset_configuration() sometimes,
       preventing sysfs thrash, and warns about some dangerous usage
       (which gphoto2 and other programs may be relying on).  (This is
       from Alan Stern, but I morphed an error return into a warning.)
    
     * Prevent a couple potential "no configuration" oopses. (Alan's?)
    
     * Remove one broken call from usbcore,  in the "device morphed" path
       of usb_reset_device().  This should be more polite now, hanging
       that one device rather than khubd.

    This updates the existing Ethernet gadget driver to
    support an additional RNDIS configuration on all
    current USB controllers that can support one.
    
    It also includes a bit more work to address the complex
    autoconfiguration of this driver.  Needs testing on PXA.
    
    Patch (mostly) contributed by Robert Schwebel, and developed
    with support from Auerswald GmbH.

    ServeRAID ( ips ) 7.00.15
    
    ith the completion of testing at Adaptec and IBM, the latest version of
    the ServeRAID Linux device driver ( ips Version 7.00.15 )is now
    available. Attached is the patches against the previous ServeRAID
    releases.  Basically, this is a convergence to a common ips driver code
    base for the 2.4 and 2.6 kernels.
    
    This driver is based on the driver currently in 2.6, so you while there
    appears to be lots of changes to the 2.4 driver,  the changes to the
    current 2.6 driver are trivial ( the only changes are  version number
    changes and the addition of some new adapter ID's ).  For 2.4, this was
    primarily a testing effort to ensure that the 2.6 driver code was stable
    when built for a 2.4 kernel.

    MPT Fusion driver 3.01.03 update
    
    From: "Moore, Eric Dean" <Emoore@lsil.com>
    
    Changelog for mpt version 3.01.03:
    
    (1)  Fix fifo memory allocation under 64bit systems
    by merging 3 seperate memory allocations into one call.
    Before this fix, it was possible that these seperate
    pci_alloc_consistent() calls were crossing the 4GB
    hardware boundary.
    Delete the MPTBASE_MEM_ALLOC_FIFO_FIX logic.
    Backout recent ak@muc.de workaround.
    
    (2) Replace wrappers for CHIPREG_XXX with defines;
    per request from Jeff Garzik [jgarzik@pobox.com]
    
    (3) Remove support for FC909.
    
    (4) Remove PortIo modules parameter.
    
    (5) Move procmpt_destroy function before pci_unregister_driver,
    as the memory allocated for the proc was not being deallocated.
    
    (6) Remove mptscshi_reset_timeouts function. The timer was
    already expired when mod_timer is called.
    
    (7) Fix small bug in slave_destroy, which could prevent domain
    validation on hidden drive in a RAID volume.
    
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Changelog for mpt version 3.01.02:
    
    (1) Andi Kleen[ak@suse.de]

    [PATCH] ia64: only scan SN2 PCI busses that exist
    
    sn_pci_init was unconditionally scanning 255 PCI busses, even though
    only a few are actually present on most systems.  This patch adds a
    check to make sure a given bus exists before doing the scan, which
    saves a little memory and also makes /sys/devices reflect reality a
    bit more closely.

    [PATCH] PCI Hotplug: Rewrite acpiphp detect_used_resource
    
    There are two unrelated problems in acpiphp that are fixed by this patch.
    First, acpiphp can be a module, so it is unsafe to probe the BARs of each
    device while it initialises -- the device may be active at the time.
    Second, it does not know about PCI-PCI bridge registers and so it reads
    garbage for the last 4 registers of the PCI-PCI bridge card and doesn't
    take into account the ranges that are forwarded by the bridge.
    
    This patch avoids all that by using the struct resources embedded in
    the pci_dev.  Note that we no longer need to recurse as all the devices
    on the other side of a PCI-PCI bridge have their resources entirely
    contained within the PCI-PCI bridge's ranges.

    PCI: add ability to access pci extended config space for PCI Express devices
    
    Patch originally written by Intel, cleaned up and made sane by
    Matthew Wilcox <willy@debian.org> and then tweaked a bit more by me.
    
    From Matt's original email:
     - Add cfg_size to struct pci_dev.
     - Use it in sysfs and procfs.
     - Introduce pci_find_ext_capability() for finding extended capabilities.
     - Change the PCI_X_STATUS defines to match the spec (mea culpa there).
     - Add defines for the extended capabilities.

    [PATCH] I2C: Setting w83627hf fan_div preserves fan_min
    
    Here is a patch that updates the w83627hf driver in the exact same way I
    did recently for the w83781d driver. There were two problems:
    1* Fan divisor storing code was ugly, badly ripped from the 2.4 w83627hf
       driver and/or the 2.6 w83781d driver.
    2* Setting fan divisors wouldn't preserve fan mins.
    
    Exactly the same as w83781d:
    http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg06952.html
    http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg07008.html
    
    No surprise since the w83627hf driver is a fork of the w83781d driver.
    
    Since the two drivers are strongly similar, I took the code directly
    from the updated w83781d driver. I cannot test the w83627hf driver
    (testers welcome BTW) but this makes me feel confident that the code is
    correct.
    
    To make it clear, this single patch is the w83627f equivalent of the
    three patches I submitted for the w83781d:
    * Cleanup
    * Refactoring
    * Setting fan_div preserves fan_min
    All in one (much better looking BTW).

    [PATCH] I2C: adm1021 (probably) does something VERY,VERY BAD
    
    Quoting myself:
    
    > 3* Drop adm1021's limit init. This was already done in the 2.4 driver
    > and should have been done in 2.6 as well.
    
    Here is a patch that does that. It also prevents bit 7 (and unused bits)
    of configuration register from being reset, as was discussed before:
      http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg04593.html
    That second part needs to be backported to the 2.4 driver, and I will do
    so.
    
    Additionally, we get rid of a useless label.
    
    The patch is untested (I don't own any supported chip) but quite
    straightforward IMHO.

    [PATCH] USB: Add dummy_hcd to the main kernel
    
    This is a resubmission of as225, together with appropriate changes for the
    g_serial driver.  David Brownell's latest g_ether update makes it
    unnecessary to change that file or gadget_chips.h.
    
    
    
    dummy_hcd is simultaneously a host controller driver and a device
    controller driver.  It creates a simulated HC together with a simulated
    UDC plugged into it.  Gadget drivers can run under the simulated UDC and
    will appear as regular USB devices on the simulated HC.  The simulation is
    reasonably (although not totally) realistic.
    
    It's a wonderful tool for testing and developing gadget drivers without
    the need for lots of additional hardware: Both the host driver and the
    gadget driver can run on the same computer.  It's been available for quite
    some time in David's gadget-2.6 tree and it works well.  I couldn't have
    gotten the file-storage gadget running in any reasonable length of time
    without it.

    [PATCH] USB: g_ether does endpoint autoconfig too
    
    Here's an update for the Ethernet gadget that corresponds
    to the earlier one for Gadget Zero ... it gets rid of almost
    all the remaining controller-specific #ifdefs in this driver.
    (And also lets the driver initialize using "dummy_hcd".)
    
    This is a significant step towards doing hardware-specific
    configuration at run time (or at least init-time) rather
    than compile time, but other patches will be needed to take
    it the rest of the way there.   (Especially considering the
    RNDIS support...)  The runtime footprint of the driver shrank
    a bit, mostly because things moved into the init section.

    [libata] more cmd queue path cleanups
    
    Final part in tonight's series of changes to clean up the
    command queueing path.
    
    The simulate-ATA-over-SCSI code is moved to a new function,
    ata_scsi_simulate(), and ata_scsi_rw_queue() is renamed to
    ata_scsi_translate().  With the SCSI CDB debugging dump function
    also moved into its own function, the queue-command path is now
    nice, compact, and readable.

    [PATCH] USB: UHCI: Get rid of excessive spinlocks
    
    This patch introduces a major simplification into the UHCI driver by
    replacing its multiple spinlocks with a single one.  The protected area of
    code is slightly larger and there's more possibilities for contention on
    an SMP system, but I think that shouldn't be a problem.  Stephen Hemminger
    has been kind enough to test this on his SMP computer and he hasn't
    encountered any difficulties.

    [PATCH] USB: UHCI: Improved handling of short control transfers
    
    This patch simplies the way the UHCI driver handles short control
    transfers.  When a transfer is short the HC will stop handling that
    endpoint, and it's necessary to get it going again so that the status
    stage of the control transfer can take place.  Currently the driver does
    this by allocating a new QH for the transfer and setting its element
    pointer to point at the final status TD.  The old QH is recycled.  But
    it's not necessary to go to all that trouble; the element pointer in the
    original QH can be updated directly.
    
    Normally the element pointer is supposed to be owned by the HC, and it's
    not safe to just change its value since the HC may overwrite it at any
    time.  But when a transfer is stopped because of a short packet, the
    current TD is marked inactive and the HC will not update the element
    pointer.  To write an unchanged pointer value back to memory would be a
    waste of PCI bus cycles.  Now the UHCI spec doesn't say explicitly that an
    HC _can't_ do this, but I've tested both Intel and VIA hardware and
    neither of them does.
    
    As a side effect of this change, some of the code for removing QHs can be
    eliminated.

    [PATCH] USB: UHCI: Do short packet detection correctly
    
    This patch makes some simple changes to the way the UHCI driver does short
    packet detection.  The current implementation is incorrect in several
    ways:
    
    	The Short-Packet-Detect flag is set for OUT transfers, which
    	yields undefined behavior according to the UHCI spec.
    
    	It's not set for URBs with URB_SHORT_NOT_OK, which is just the
    	opposite of what we want!  Those are the ones where short packets
    	do matter.
    
    	It is set for the last packet in a transfer, which causes an
    	unnecessary pause in the data flow (except of course that the
    	pause _is_ necessary when URB_SHORT_NOT_OK is set).
    
    The patch also implements the URB_NO_INTERRUPT flag for bulk transfers,
    which can help improve system performance by reducing interrupt overhead.

    [PATCH] USB: Don't trust raw descriptor length in devioc.
    
    This is a very minor point, unlikely ever to come up.  But just in case...
    
    It's conceivable that a device might transmit different values for a
    configuration descriptor's wTotalLength the first time we ask for it (in
    order to get the length) and the second time (to get the entire
    descriptor).  Should that improbable event occur, the rawdescriptor buffer
    could be allocated using a size that's smaller than the length recorded in
    the rawdescriptor itself.  This patch protects devio.c against such a
    problem.
    
    If you feel this sequence of events is too unlikely to worry about, then
    don't bother to apply the patch.

    [PATCH] USB: race condition in open of w9968cf
    
    there's a race in how open handles multiple openers.
    You implement exclusive opening and wait for close
    in case of further openers. However if there are more than one
    waiter, only one of them must be allowed to proceed.

    Thanks for reviewing this code, I'm new to Linux driver development and
    more eyes on my work is a good thing.   I've actually been working on
    some more cleanups to the driver to fix the race between open and
    disconnect, and was just about to send it in...
    
    So, the attached patch against 2.6.5-rc1-mm1 includes a mutex to lock
    the open/disconnect paths, modelled after the usb-skeleton driver. It
    includes Oliver Neukum's fixes and other cleanups as well.

    [PATCH] USB: Regularize unusual_devs entries for Genesys Logic
    
    I saw that you just added another unusual_devs.h entry submitted by
    Henning Schild, for vendor ID 0x05e3.  It turns out this is our old friend
    Genesys Logic.
    
    A recent message from Brad Campbell included a Windows driver file by
    Genesys, and it included these lines:
    
    USB\VID_05E3&PID_0700.DeviceDesc="USB Card Reader"
    USB\VID_05E3&PID_0701.DeviceDesc="USB Optical Device"
    USB\VID_05E3&PID_0702.DeviceDesc="USB Mass Storage Device"
    
    Based on this information, we can clean up the 0x05e3 entries in
    unusual_devs.h.  This patch puts all three entries into a regularized
    form.

    OSDL bug 2006
    
    Need to initialize some timers a bit earlier to clean up safely
    after very early init HCD failures.
    
    Those early init faults were needlessly mysterious since they
    didn't emit diagnostics except at HCD discretion.

    [PATCH] USB: fix osdl bugid 481 (USB boot messages)
    
    Some boot-time messages were obnoxiously long because
    they used "old-style" diagnostics.
    
    
    OSDL bugid 481
    
    Get rid of most remaining "old style" diagnostics from usbcore.
    Most messages use driver model style diagnostics.  Messages that
    don't have an associated device use the standard kernel printk
    wrappers and label themselves as from "usbcore".  (Except that
    there's no such wrapper for KERN_ERR.)
    
    This doesn't touch usbfs, "config.c" (Alan's patches do this), or
    usb_reset_device() (needs a more substantial overhaul).  Or any
    other USB drivers (notably HID).

    [PATCH] USB: Code improvements for core/config.c
    
    This patch makes some improvements to the code in config.c.
    
    	Create a subroutine to handle the repeated task of skipping
    	forward to the next descriptor of a certain type.
    
    	Remove some fairly useless debugging messages (they could
    	never even have been enabled in the pre-as221 code).
    
    	Verify that endpoint descriptors don't have an address
    	equal to 0 (as well as not being above 15).
    
    	Rename some local variables so they are a little more
    	consistent and meaningful.
    
    Despite all the changes, the functionality should remain the same.
    Please apply.

    [PATCH] USB: Improve core/config.c error messages
    
    This patch improves error reporting in the configuration parsing routines.
    It also adds a few extra minor tweaks.
    
    	#include linux/config.h and make the usual DEBUG settings
    	available.
    
    	Use the driver-model dev_xxx() macros for log output.
    
    	Be much more explicit about the nature of errors, including
    	configuration, interface, and altsetting numbers where
    	appropriate.
    
    	Log fatal problems as errors, non-fatal ones as warnings.
    
    	Remove a #define'd constant that is already set in linux/usb.h.
    
    	Fix some variables declared as pointer to char that really
    	should be pointers to unsigned char.
    
    	Replace a whole bunch of "out-of-memory" error messages with
    	a single message.
    
    	Wrap source lines that are longer than 80 columns (but not
    	log output lines!).
    
    	Clean up the logic for detecting errors when retrieving a
    	configuration descriptor.
    
    Apart from the log messages themselves, this introduces no functional
    changes.

    [PATCH] USB: USB gadgets can autoconfigure endpoints
    
    This adds some code that gadget drivers can call from
    driver initialization, to simplify the "configure against
    this hardware" step.
    
    
    Add endpoint autoconfiguration for gadget drivers.
    
    Endpoint selection is currently being done with conditional compilation.
    That doesn't look nice, but more importantly it doesn't work well with
    the model that some distributions won't be custom-matched to hardware.
    Say, a PDA distro running on iPaq (pxa2xx_udc) or Axim (mq11xx_udc).
    
    This code just makes it easier for drivers to match to hardware at
    run-time.  It's a convenience function for something they could have
    been doing already, but weren't.

    [PATCH] USB: gadget zero does endpoint autoconfig
    
    Here's where all those preceding autoconfig patches start
    to fit together:  one gadget driver gets rid of almost all
    the controller-specific #ifdeffery.
    
    Two of the other gadget drivers can do the same thing,
    and just as easily:  file storage, and serial.  (I'll
    hope their maintainers do those changes though.)
    
    The "ether.c" gadget driver is a lot more complicated to
    do this way since it has to cope with some differences
    by switching to alternate protocols (CDC Ethernet vs
    a subset) and soon be able to handle RNDIS.  So that'll
    be a while yet.
    
    
    Gadget Zero learns to autoconfigure.
    
        - Gets rid of remaining controller-specific #ifdeffery.  Now
          hardware choices can be made at run time too (not just
          compile time).
    
        - Simplifies its use of the "DEBUG" CPP symbol.
    
        - Force device to report itself consistently as self-powered.

    [PATCH] USB: FTDI 232BM "USB-RS232 OptoBridge"
    
    we (the german company Gude Analog und Digitalsysteme GmbH,
    http://www.gude.info) have manufactored a USB<->RS232 adapter with
    galvanic isolated RS232 Interface. Data is transmitted by optical
    signals only.
    
    The Product's name is "USB-RS232 OptoBridge".
    We used the FTDI 233BM Chip with PID 0xE889 (VID 0x0403).
    The Product will be released this Cebit 2004.
    
    Could you please extend the ftdi_sio code with this PID.
    You find a .diff file attached which I have tested with kernel 2.6.4
    
    At http://ftdi-usb-sio.sourceforge.net/ I saw that you provide a patch
    for 2.4.x kernels. Will our PID also find it's way in this back-ported
    driver patch?
    
    In the future (in the next 10 month), our company will have some more
    Products using the FTDI Chip. The PID's FTDI already allocated for us
    are: E888 to E88F and E808 to E80F

    I agree it's not very important, but I prefer it to be done before any
    driver with the error is used as a base to port a new driver, and the
    misinformation spreads.

    [libata] consolidate data transfer mode handling
    
    The various ways you can send data to/from your ATA device is
    known as the ATA taskfile protocol:  PIO single sector, PIO
    multiple sector, DMA, DMA TCQ, DMA NCQ, ...
    
    Prior to this change, the data direction (read/write) was encoded
    implicitly into the ATA_PROT_xxx value itself.  This increased
    complexity in some areas, and inhibited flexibility in others.
    
    This change separates data direction from taskfile protocol, and also
    moves the data direction flag (ATA_QCFLAG_WRITE) down to a lower
    level (ATA_TFLAG_WRITE).

    This removes a series of branches in the read/write fast path,
    and in general cleans up that particular spot of code.

    [PATCH] Sysfs for framebuffer
    
    the following patch (against 2.6.5-rc2) teaches fb to use class_simple.
    With this patch udev will automagically create device nodes for each
    framebuffer registered. Once all drivers are converted to
    framebuffer_{alloc,release} we can switch to our own class.
    
    This is what sysfs dir looks like:
    
    notebook:~# tree /sys/class/graphics/
    /sys/class/graphics/
    `-- fb0
        `-- dev

    [PATCH] More domain validation fixes and additions
    
    Following testing in more extreme situations, the following problems
    turned up:
    
    - The error handler can offline the device during DV (most particularly
    true when transport parameters are undetectably mismatched).  Fixed by
    modifying the state model to allow this and then having DV set the
    device back online for the retry.
    
    - DV needs to be serialised.  Fixed by introducing a per device
    semaphore.
    
    - Cosmetically, it's nice to trigger DV from userland, so added a
    revalidate sysfs entry.

    [CPUFREQ] SPEEDSTEP_RELAXED_CAP_CHECK option.
    A few SpeedStep-capable systems don't perform according to specification: the
    CPUID and/or some MSRs don't tell us the CPU is SpeedStep capable even though
    it definitely is. Allow a relaxed checking for one such issue by a module
    parameter only available if a config option is turned on. This is done to
    avoid the risk of doing invalid speedstep instructions on systems which do
    not support it, and which might even lead to (hardware) failure.

    [CPUFREQ] Merge ACPI perflib.
    Use ACPI _PSS data to determine valid frequency and voltage pairs on Enhanced
    SpeedStep-capable processors. An original form of such ACPI-PentiumM-cpufreq
    interaction was sent to the cpufreq list by David Moore in June last year; the
    attached patch utilizes his code to set _PDC.
    
    The new ACPI "P-States library" is utilized to obtain the correct frequency
    and MSR value pairs for the speedstep-centrino driver. Only if no such proper
    table exists (!CONFIG_ACPI, broken ACPI tables, etc.), fall back to the
    existing hard-coded table.
    
    If anyone has a better idea for the Kconfig section, please tell me so.
    
    This version of this patch has proper acpi_state setting included, and also
    has a hint in the banner of the centrino_cpu_init_acpi() function, as Jeremey
    Fitzhardinge suggested.

    [PATCH] I2C: w83781d fan_div code refactoring
    
    Quoting myself:
    
    > This tends to increase the size of the three set_store_regs_fan_div
    > functions, and I am considering refactoring them at some point. Later
    > though.
    
    Here is the promised refactoring. Tested on my AS99127F rev.1, seems to
    work. As for the previous patch, there is a part that I cannot test with
    the AS99127F, so additional testing is welcome.
    
    I agree this makes the code slightly less readable, but this saves 60
    lines of code (1754 bytes, around 3% of the driver total), and is
    actually far less complex that I first feared.

    [TG3]: Jumbo frames and FTQ reset patch.
    
    1. Set extended packet length bit in phy register 0x18 shadow register 0
    on all chips that support jumbo frames (i.e. all chips except 5705 and
    its variants). Jumbo frame reception is less reliable (more CRC errors)
    if this bit is not set. This bit can be set regardless of the current
    MTU setting.
    
    
    2. Remove FTQ reset during chip init. This is the best fix for the ASF
    race condition problem that I mentioned a few months ago. The FTQ reset
    is redundant as it is already reset during GRC reset.

    [PATCH] Fix error handler offline behaviour
    
    No-one seems to have noticed, but there's a bug in our offline handling
    which can cause the eh to loop forever when it tries to offline a device
    (basically offline I/O rejections are done in prep, which doesn't work
    for already prepped commands).
    
    The attached fixes this, and also sweeps offline up into a fairly fully
    fledged scsi state model.
    
    With this applied I can now offline my root device under load without
    causing a SCSI hang (ext2 BUG()s rather unhappily but at least that's
    not a SCSI problem).

    [netdrvr r8169] Rx wrap bug:
    - rtl8169_rx_interrupt() can wrap and process an Rx descriptor that it has
      invalidated a few iterations before. The patch limits the number of
      allowed descriptors between two invocations of the Rx refill function;
    - rtl8169_rx_interrupt() now looks similar to rtl8169_tx_interrupt to
      highlight the issue.

Date:   Sat Jan 10 05:42:25 2004 -0500

    [netdrvr r8169] Conversion of Rx data buffers to PCI DMA
    - endianness is kept in a fscked state as it is in the original code
      (will be adressed in a later patch);
    - rtl8169_rx_clear() walks the buffer ring and releases the allocated
      data buffers. It needs to be used in two places:
      - rtl8169_init_ring() failure path;
      - normal device release (i.e. rtl8169_close);
    - rtl8169_free_rx_skb() releases a Rx data buffer. Mostly an helper
      for rtl8169_rx_clear(). As such it must:
      - unmap the memory area;
      - release the skb;
      - prevent the ring descriptor from being used again;
    - rtl8169_alloc_rx_skb() prepares a Rx data buffer for use.
      As such it must:
      - allocate an skb;
      - map the memory area;
      - reflect the changes in the ring descriptor.
      This function is balanced by rtl8169_free_rx_skb().
    - rtl8169_unmap_rx() simply helps with the 80-columns limit.
    - rtl8169_rx_fill() walks a given range of the buffer ring and
      try to turn any descriptor into a ready to use one. It returns the
      count of modified descriptors and exits if an allocation fails.
      It can be seen as balanced by rtl8169_rx_clear(). Motivation:
      - partially abstract the (usually big) piece of code for the refill
        logic at the end of the Rx interrupt;
      - factorize the refill logic and the initial ring setup.
    - simple conversion of rtl8169_rx_interrupt() without rx_copybreak
      (will be adressed in a later patch).

Date:   Sat Jan 10 05:41:42 2004 -0500

    [netdrvr r8169] Conversion of Rx/Tx descriptors to consistent DMA:
    - use pci_alloc_consistent() for Rx/Tx descriptors in rtl8169_open()
      (balanced by pci_free_consistent() on error path as well as in
      rtl8169_close());
    - removal of the fields {Rx/Tx}DescArrays in struct rtl8169_private
      as there is no need to store a non-256 bytes aligned address any more;
    - fix for rtl8169_open() leak when RxBufferRings allocation fails.
      Said allocation is pushed to rtl8169_init_ring() as part of an evil
      cunning plan.

    fix to not retime out the same session twice since it can invalidate the newly reestablished session unnecessarily

commit a6f63f7a1e78dd96d476d6b65bb5d4d8cd393cf1
Author: Steve French <stevef@linux.local>
Date:   Sun Nov 2 11:44:48 2003 -0600

    Fix EIO caused by network timeouts on changing file size.
    To avoid spurious oplock breaks from server, in the case
    of inodes that we already have open, avoid doing path
    based setting of file size if we can do it by handle.
    This keeps our caching token (oplock) and avoids
    timeouts when the local oplock break takes longer to flush
    writebehind data than the SMB timeout for the SetPathInfo
    request would allow
