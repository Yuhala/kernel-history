    packet: fix error handling
    
    The packet driver is assuming (reasonably) that the (undocumented)
    request.errors is an errno.  But it is in fact some mysterious bitfield.  When
    things go wrong we return weird positive numbers to the VFS as pointers and it
    goes oops.
    
    Thanks to William Heimbigner for reporting and diagnosis.
    
    (It doesn't oops, but this driver still doesn't work for William)

    [NETLINK]: Infinite recursion in netlink.
    
    Reply to NETLINK_FIB_LOOKUP messages were misrouted back to kernel,
    which resulted in infinite recursion and stack overflow.
    
    The bug is present in all kernel versions since the feature appeared.
    
    The patch also makes some minimal cleanup:
    
    1. Return something consistent (-ENOENT) when fib table is missing
    2. Do not crash when queue is empty (does not happen, but yet)
    3. Put result of lookup

    cfq-iosched: fix alias + front merge bug
    
    There's a really rare and obscure bug in CFQ, that causes a crash in
    cfq_dispatch_insert() due to rq == NULL.  One example of the resulting
    oops is seen here:
    
    	http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/15/41
    
    Neil correctly diagnosed the situation for how this can happen: if two
    concurrent requests with the exact same sector number (due to direct IO
    or aliasing between MD and the raw device access), the alias handling
    will add the request to the sortlist, but next_rq remains NULL.
    
    Read the more complete analysis at:
    
    	http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/25/57
    
    This looks like it requires md to trigger, even though it should
    potentially be possible to due with O_DIRECT (at least if you edit the
    kernel and doctor some of the unplug calls).
    
    The fix is to move the ->next_rq update to when we add a request to the
    rbtree. Then we remove the possibility for a request to exist in the
    rbtree code, but not have ->next_rq correctly updated.

    usb-net/pegasus: fix pegasus carrier detection
    
    Broken by 4a1728a28a193aa388900714bbb1f375e08a6d8e which switched the
    return semantics of read_mii_word() but didn't fix usage of
    read_mii_word() to conform to the new semantics.
    
    Setting carrier to off based on the NO_CARRIER flag is also incorrect as
    that flag only triggers on TX failure and therefore isn't correct when
    no frames are being transmitted.  Since there is already a 2*HZ MII
    carrier check going on, defer to that.
    
    Add a TRUST_LINK_STATUS feature flag for adapters where the LINK_STATUS
    flag is actually correct, and use that rather than the NO_CARRIER flag.

    sis900: Allocate rx replacement buffer before rx operation
    
    	The sis900 driver appears to have a bug in which the receive routine
    passes the skbuff holding the received frame to the network stack before
    refilling the buffer in the rx ring.  If a new skbuff cannot be allocated, the
    driver simply leaves a hole in the rx ring, which causes the driver to stop
    receiving frames and become non-recoverable without an rmmod/insmod according to
    reporters.  This patch reverses that order, attempting to allocate a replacement
    buffer first, and receiving the new frame only if one can be allocated.  If no
    skbuff can be allocated, the current skbuf in the rx ring is recycled, dropping
    the current frame, but keeping the NIC operational.

    The following patch fixes a kernel bug in depca_platform_probe().
    
    We don't use a dynamic pointer for pldev->dev.platform_data, so it seems
    that the correct way to proceed if platform_device_add(pldev) fails is
    to explicitly set the pldev->dev.platform_data pointer to NULL, before
    calling the platform_device_put(pldev), or it will be kfree'ed by
    platform_device_release().

    reiserfs: fix xattr root locking/refcount bug
    
    The listxattr() and getxattr() operations are only protected by a read
    lock.  As a result, if either of these operations run in parallel, a race
    condition exists where the xattr_root will end up being cached twice, which
    results in the leaking of a reference and a BUG() on umount.
    
    This patch refactors get_xa_root(), __get_xa_root(), and create_xa_root(),
    into one get_xa_root() function that takes the appropriate locking around
    the entire critical section.

    v9fs: don't use primary fid when removing file
    
    v9fs_insert uses v9fs_fid_lookup (which also locks the fid) to get the
    primary fid associated with the dentry and destroys the v9fs_fid struct
    after removing the file.  If another process called v9fs_fid_lookup on the
    same dentry, it may wait undefinitely for the fid's lock (as the struct is
    freed).
    
    This patch changes v9fs_remove to use a cloned fid, so the primary fid is
    not locked and freed.

    paride drivers: initialize spinlocks
    
    pcd_lock and pf_spin_lock are passed to blk_init_queue() which, seeing them
    as valid lock pointer, sets it as ->queue_lock.
    
    The problem is that pcd_lock and pf_spin_lock aren't initialized anywhere.

    Taskstats fix the structure members alignment issue
    
    We broke the the alignment of members of taskstats to the 8 byte boundary
    with the CSA patches.  In the current kernel, the taskstats structure is
    not suitable for use by 32 bit applications in a 64 bit kernel.

        );
    
    This is one way to solve the problem without re-arranging structure members
    is to pack the structure.  The patch adds an __attribute__((aligned(8))) to
    the taskstats structure members so that 32 bit applications using taskstats
    can work with a 64 bit kernel.
    
    Using __attribute__((packed)) would break the 64 bit alignment of members.
    
    The fix was tested on x86_64. After the fix, we got
    
    Offsets of taskstats' members (64 bit kernel, 64 bit application)

    NULL pointer access in check_modem_status() in 8250.c.  I confirmed this
    problem is fixed by the attached patch, but I don't know this is the
    correct fix.

    Fix the possible NULL pointer access in check_modem_status() in 8250.c.  The
    check_modem_status() would access 'info' member of uart_port structure, but it
    is not initialized before uart_open() is called.  The check_modem_status() can
    be called through /proc/tty/driver/serial before uart_open() is called.

    [PATCH] x86-64: Always flush all pages in change_page_attr
    
    change_page_attr on x86-64 only flushed the TLB for pages that got
    reverted. That's not correct: it has to be flushed in all cases.
    
    This bug was added in some earlier changes.
    
    Just flush all pages for now.
    
    This could be done more efficiently, but for this late in the release
    this seem to be the best fix.

    [PATCH] x86: Remove noreplacement option
    
    noreplacement is dangerous on modern systems because it will not replace the
    context switch FNSAVE with SSE aware FXSAVE. But other places in the kernel still assume
    SSE and do FXSAVE and the CPU will then access FXSAVE information with
    FNSAVE and cause corruption.
    
    Easiest way to avoid this is to remove the option. It was mostly for paranoia
    reasons anyways and alternative()s have been stable for some time.
    
    Thanks to Jeremy F. for reporting and helping debug it.

    [XFRM]: beet: fix pseudo header length value
    
    draft-nikander-esp-beet-mode-07.txt is not entirely clear on how the length
    value of the pseudo header should be calculated, it states "The Header Length
    field contains the length of the pseudo header, IPv4 options, and padding in
    8 octets units.", but also states "Length in octets (Header Len + 1) * 8".
    draft-nikander-esp-beet-mode-08-pre1.txt [1] clarifies this, the header length
    should not include the first 8 byte.
    
    This change affects backwards compatibility, but option encapsulation didn't
    work until very recently anyway.

    RPC: Fix the TCP resend semantics for NFSv4
    
    Fix a regression due to the patch "NFS: disconnect before retrying NFSv4
    requests over TCP"
    
    The assumption made in xprt_transmit() that the condition
    	"req->rq_bytes_sent == 0 and request is on the receive list"
    should imply that we're dealing with a retransmission is false.
    Firstly, it may simply happen that the socket send queue was full
    at the time the request was initially sent through xprt_transmit().
    Secondly, doing this for each request that was retransmitted implies
    that we disconnect and reconnect for _every_ request that happened to
    be retransmitted irrespective of whether or not a disconnection has
    already occurred.
    
    Fix is to move this logic into the call_status request timeout handler.

    cfq-iosched: fix sequential write regression
    
    We have a 10-15% performance regression for sequential writes on TCQ/NCQ
    enabled drives in 2.6.21-rcX after the CFQ update went in.  It has been
    reported by Valerie Clement <valerie.clement@bull.net> and the Intel
    testing folks.  The regression is because of CFQ's now more aggressive
    queue control, limiting the depth available to the device.
    
    This patches fixes that regression by allowing a greater depth when only
    one queue is busy.  It has been tested to not impact sync-vs-async
    workloads too much - we still do a lot better than 2.6.20.

    [MIPS] Fix wrong checksum for split TCP packets on 64-bit MIPS
    
    I've traced down an off-by-one TCP checksum calculation error under
    the following conditions:
    
    1) The TCP code needs to split a full-sized packet due to a reduced
       MSS (typically due to the addition of TCP options mid-stream like
       SACK).
       _AND_
    2) The checksum of the 2nd fragment is larger than the checksum of the
       original packet.  After subtraction this results in a checksum for
       the 1st fragment with bits 16..31 set to 1. (this is ok)
       _AND_
    3) The checksum of the 1st fragment's TCP header plus the previously
       32bit checksum of the 1st fragment DOES NOT cause a 32bit overflow
       when added together.  This results in a checksum of the TCP header
       plus TCP data that still has the upper 16 bits as 1's.
       _THEN_
    4) The TCP+data checksum is added to the checksum of the pseudo IP
       header with csum_tcpudp_nofold() incorrectly (the bug).
    
    The problem is the checksum of the TCP+data is passed to
    csum_tcpudp_nofold() as an 32bit unsigned value, however the assembly
    code acts on it as if it is a 64bit unsigned value.
    
    This causes an incorrect 32->64bit extension if the sum has bit 31
    set.  The resulting checksum is off by one.
    
    This problems is data and TCP header dependent due to #2 and #3
    above so it doesn't occur on every TCP packet split.

    Revert "e1000: fix NAPI performance on 4-port adapters"
    
    This reverts commit 60cba200f11b6f90f35634c5cd608773ae3721b7.  It's been
    linked to lockups of the e1000 hardware, see for example
    
    	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=229603
    
    but it's likely that the commit itself is not really introducing the
    bug, but just allowing an unrelated problem to rear its ugly head (ie
    one current working theory is that the code exposes us to a hardware
    race condition by decreasing the amount of time we spend in each NAPI
    poll cycle).
    
    We'll revert it until root cause is known.  Intel has a repeatable
    reproduction on two different machines and bus traces of the hardware
    doing something bad.

    [PPP]: Fix skbuff.c:BUG due incorrect logic in process_input_packet()
    
    From: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>
    
    This fixes:
    
    Subject: kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c in linux-2.6.21-rc6
    
    process_input_packet() treats the case where the first byte is 0xff
    (PPP_ALLSTATIONS) but the second byte is 0x03 (PPP_UI) as indicating a
    packet with a PPP protocol number of 0xff.  Arguably that's wrong
    since PPP protocol 0xff is reserved, and the RFC does envision the
    possibility of receiving frames where the control field has values
    other than 0x03.

    The Yukon EC Ultra chips have transmit settings for store and

    performance goes from 750Mbytes/sec to 940Mbytes/sec (non-jumbo).
    
    It is also possible to do Jumbo mode, but it means turning off
    TSO and checksum offload so the performance gets worse. There isn't
    enough buffering for checksum offload to work.

    spidernet: Fix problem sending IP fragments
    
    The basic structure of "normal" UDP/IP/Ethernet
    frames (that actually work):
     - It starts with the Ethernet header (dest MAC, src MAC, etc.)
     - The next part is occupied by the IP header (version info, length of
    packet, id=0, fragment offset=0, checksum, from / to address, etc.)
     - Then comes the UDP header (src / dest port, length, checksum)
     - Actual payload
     - Ethernet checksum
    
    Now what's different for IP fragment:
     - The IP header has id set to some value (same for all fragments),
    offset is set appropriately (i.e. 0 for first fragment, following
    according to size of other fragments), size is the length of the frame.
     - UDP header is unchanged. I.e. length is according to full UDP
    datagram, not just the part within the actual frame! But this is only
    true within the first frame: all following frames don't have a valid
    UDP-header at all.
    
    The spidernet silicon seems to be quite intelligent: It's able to
    compute (IP / UDP / Ethernet) checksums on the fly and tests if frames
    are conforming to RFC -- at least conforming to RFC on complete frames.
    
    But IP fragments are different as explained above:
    I.e. for IP fragments containing part of a UDP datagram it sees
    incompatible length in the headers for IP and UDP in the first frame
    and, thus, skips this frame. But the content *is* correct for IP
    fragments. For all following frames it finds (most probably) no valid
    UDP header at all. But this *is* also correct for IP fragments.
    
    The Linux IP-stack seems to be clever in this point. It expects the
    spidernet to calculate the checksum (since the module claims to be able
    to do so) and marks the skb's for "normal" frames accordingly
    (ip_summed set to CHECKSUM_HW).
    But for the IP fragments it does not expect the driver to be capable to
    handle the frames appropriately. Thus all checksums are allready
    computed. This is also flaged within the skb (ip_summed set to
    CHECKSUM_NONE).
    
    Unfortunately the spidernet driver ignores that hints. It tries to send
    the IP fragments of UDP datagrams as normal UDP/IP frames. Since they
    have different structure the silicon detects them the be not
    "well-formed" and skips them.
    
    The following one-liner against 2.6.21-rc2 changes this behavior. If the
    IP-stack claims to have done the checksumming, the driver should not
    try to checksum (and analyze) the frame but send it as is.

    KVM: Fix off-by-one when writing to a nonpae guest pde
    
    Nonpae guest pdes are shadowed by two pae ptes, so we double the offset
    twice: once to account for the pte size difference, and once because we
    need to shadow pdes for a single guest pde.
    
    But when writing to the upper guest pde we also need to truncate the
    lower bits, otherwise the multiply shifts these bits into the pde index
    and causes an access to the wrong shadow pde.  If we're at the end of the
    page (accessing the very last guest pde) we can even overflow into the
    next host page and oops.

    [NETLINK]: Don't attach callback to a going-away netlink socket
    
    There is a race between netlink_dump_start() and netlink_release()
    that can lead to the situation when a netlink socket with non-zero
    callback is freed.
    
    Here it is:
    
    CPU1:                           CPU2
    netlink_release():              netlink_dump_start():
    
                                    sk = netlink_lookup(); /* OK */
    
    netlink_remove();
    
    spin_lock(&nlk->cb_lock);
    if (nlk->cb) { /* false */
      ...
    }
    spin_unlock(&nlk->cb_lock);
    
                                    spin_lock(&nlk->cb_lock);
                                    if (nlk->cb) { /* false */
                                             ...
                                    }
                                    nlk->cb = cb;
                                    spin_unlock(&nlk->cb_lock);
                                    ...
    sock_orphan(sk);
    /*
     * proceed with releasing
     * the socket
     */
    
    The proposal it to make sock_orphan before detaching the callback
    in netlink_release() and to check for the sock to be SOCK_DEAD in
    netlink_dump_start() before setting a new callback.

    [IrDA]: Correctly handling socket error
    
    This patch fixes an oops first reported in mid 2006 - see
    http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/29/358 The cause of this bug report is that
    when an error is signalled on the socket, irda_recvmsg_stream returns
    without removing a local wait_queue variable from the socket's sk_sleep
    queue. This causes havoc further down the road.
    
    In response to this problem, a patch was made that invoked sock_orphan on
    the socket when receiving a disconnect indication. This is not a good fix,
    as this sets sk_sleep to NULL, causing applications sleeping in recvmsg
    (and other places) to oops.
    
    This is against the latest net-2.6 and should be considered for -stable
    inclusion.

    [SCTP]: Do not interleave non-fragments when in partial delivery
    
    The way partial delivery is currently implemnted, it is possible to
    intereleave a message (either from another steram, or unordered) that
    is not part of partial delivery process.  The only way to this is for
    a message to not be a fragment and be 'in order' or unorderd for a
    given stream.  This will result in bypassing the reassembly/ordering
    queues where things live duing partial delivery, and the
    message will be delivered to the socket in the middle of partial delivery.
    
    This is a two-fold problem, in that:
    1.  the app now must check the stream-id and flags which it may not
    be doing.
    2.  this clearing partial delivery state from the association and results
    in ulp hanging.
    
    This patch is a band-aid over a much bigger problem in that we
    don't do stream interleave.

    hwmon/w83627ehf: Fix the fan5 clock divider write
    
    Users have been complaining about the w83627ehf driver flooding their logs
    with debug messages like:
    
    w83627ehf 9191-0a10: Increasing fan 4 clock divider from 64 to 128
    
    or:
    
    w83627ehf 9191-0290: Increasing fan 4 clock divider from 4 to 8
    
    The reason is that we failed to actually write the LSB of the encoded clock
    divider value for that fan, causing the next read to report the same old value
    again and again.
    
    Additionally, the fan number was improperly reported, making the bug harder to
    find.

    knfsd: use a spinlock to protect sk_info_authunix
    
    sk_info_authunix is not being protected properly so the object that it
    points to can be cache_put twice, leading to corruption.
    
    We borrow svsk->sk_defer_lock to provide the protection.  We should
    probably rename that lock to have a more generic name - later.

    ufs proper handling of zero link case
    
    This patch should fix or partly fix this bug:
    http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8276
    
    The problem is:
    
    - if we see "zero link case" during reading inode operation, we call
      ufs_error(which remount fs readonly), but not "mark" inode as bad (1)
    
    - in readonly case we do not fill some data structures, which are used in
      read and write case (2)
    
    - VFS call ufs_delete_inode if link count is zero (3)
    
    so (1)->(3)->(2) cause oops, this patch should fix such scenario

    IB/mthca: Fix data corruption after FMR unmap on Sinai
    
    In mthca_arbel_fmr_unmap(), the high bits of the key are masked off.
    This gets rid of the effect of adjust_key(), which makes sure that
    bits 3 and 23 of the key are equal when the Sinai throughput
    optimization is enabled, and so it may happen that an FMR will end up
    with bits 3 and 23 in the key being different.  This causes data
    corruption, because when enabling the throughput optimization, the
    driver promises the HCA firmware that bits 3 and 23 of all memory keys
    will always be equal.
    
    Fix by re-applying adjust_key() after masking the key.

    [PATCH] x86: Fix potential overflow in perfctr reservation
    
    While reviewing this code again I found a potential overflow of the bitmap.
    The p4 oprofile can theoretically set bits beyond the reservation bitmap for
    specific configurations. Avoid that by sizing the bitmaps properly.

    [PATCH] x86: Fix gcc 4.2 _proxy_pda workaround
    
    Due to an over aggressive optimizer gcc 4.2 cannot optimize away _proxy_pda
    in all cases (counter intuitive, but true).  This breaks loading of some
    modules.
    
    The earlier workaround to just export a dummy symbol didn't work unfortunately
    because the module code ignores exports with 0 value.
    
    Make it 1 instead.

    NFS: Ensure PG_writeback is cleared when writeback fails
    
    If the writebacks are cancelled via nfs_cancel_dirty_list, or due to the
    memory allocation failing in nfs_flush_one/nfs_flush_multi, then we must
    ensure that the PG_writeback flag is cleared.
    
    Also ensure that we actually own the PG_writeback flag whenever we
    schedule a new writeback by making nfs_set_page_writeback() return the
    value of test_set_page_writeback().
    The PG_writeback page flag ends up replacing the functionality of the
    PG_FLUSHING nfs_page flag, so we rip that out too.

    [SCSI] 3w-xxxx: fix oops caused by incorrect REQUEST_SENSE handling
    
    3w-xxxx emulates a REQUEST_SENSE response by simply returning nothing.
    Unfortunately, it's assuming that the REQUEST_SENSE command is
    implemented with use_sg == 0, which is no longer the case.  The oops
    occurs because it's clearing the scatterlist in request_buffer instead
    of the memory region.
    
    This is fixed by using tw_transfer_internal() to transfer correctly to
    the scatterlist.

    DVB: dvb-usb-remote - fix oops when changing keymap
    
    DVB USB remotes do not support changing keycode maps but set
    input_dev->keycodesize and input_dev->keycodemax without setting
    input_dev->keycode. This causes kernel oops when user tries to
    look up (or change) current keymap.
    
    While the proper fix would be to make remotes handle keymap changes
    we'll just remove keycodemax and keycodesize initialization so
    EVIOCGKEYCODE and EVIOCSKEYCODE will simply return -EINVAL.

    [VLAN]: Allow VLAN interface on top of bridge interface
    
    When a VLAN interface is created on top of a bridge interface and
    netfilter is enabled to see the bridged packets, the packets can be
    corrupted when passing through the netfilter code. This is caused by the
    VLAN driver not setting the 'protocol' and 'nh' members of the sk_buff
    structure. In general, this is no problem as the VLAN interface is mostly
    connected to a physical ethernet interface which does not use the
    'protocol' and 'nh' members. For a bridge interface, however, these
    members do matter.

    [PATCH] autofs4: fix race in unhashed dentry code
    
    Commit f50b6f8691cae2e0064c499dd3ef3f31142987f0 introduced a race in
    autofs4 between autofs_lookup_unhashed() and autofs_dentry_release().
    
    autofs_dentry_release() ends up clearing the ->dentry and ->inode members
    of autofs_info before removing it from the rehash list.  The list is
    protected by the rehash lock in both functions, but since
    autofs_dentry_release() starts tearing the autofs_info struct down before
    removing it from the list, autofs_lookup_unhashed() can get a autofs_info
    with a NULL dentry.
    
    This patch moves the clearing of ->dentry and ->inode after the removal
    from the rehash list.

    [PATCH] reiserfs: fix key decrementing
    
    This patch fixes a bug in function decrementing a key of stat data item.
    
    Offset of reiserfs keys are compared as signed values.  To set key offset
    to maximal possible value maximal signed value has to be used.
    
    This bug is responsible for severe reiserfs filesystem corruption which
    shows itself as warning vs-13060.  reiserfsck fixes this corruption by
    filesystem tree rebuilding.

    If 'num_pages' were ever 1 more than a multiple of 8 (32bit platforms)
    or of 16 (64 bit platforms).  filemap_attr would be allocated one
    'unsigned long' shorter than required.  We need a round-up in there.

    [PATCH] cciss: unregister from SCSI before tearing down device resources
    
    We must unregister from SCSI before we unmap device resources and unhook
    the IRQ handler.  Otherwise, SCSI may send us more requests, and we won't
    be able to handle them.

    [SPARC]: avoid CHILD_MAX and OPEN_MAX constants
    
    I don't figure anyone really cares about SunOS syscall emulation, and I
    certainly don't.  But I'm getting rid of uses of the OPEN_MAX and CHILD_MAX
    compile-time constant, and these are almost the only ones.  OPEN_MAX is a
    bogus constant with no meaning about anything.  The RLIMIT_NOFILE resource
    limit is what sysconf (_SC_OPEN_MAX) actually wants to return.
    
    The CHILD_MAX cases weren't actually using anything I want to get rid of,
    but I noticed that they are there and are wrong too.  The CHILD_MAX value
    is not really unlimited as a -1 return from sysconf indicates.  The
    RLIMIT_NPROC resource limit is what sysconf (_SC_CHILD_MAX) wants to return.

    [SPARC64]: Fix SBUS IOMMU allocation code.
    
    There are several IOMMU allocator bugs.  Instead of trying to fix this
    overly complicated code, just mirror the PCI IOMMU arena allocator
    which is very stable and well stress tested.
    
    I tried to make the code as identical as possible so we can switch
    sun4u PCI and SBUS over to a common piece of IOMMU code.  All that
    will be need are two callbacks, one to do a full IOMMU flush and one
    to do a streaming buffer flush.
    
    This patch gets rid of a lot of hangs and mysterious crashes on SBUS
    sparc64 systems, at least for me.

    EHCI: fix remote wakeup regression in 2.6.21-rc
    
    There is one significant difference between the behavior of root hubs
    (as embodied in host controller hardware) and external hubs: When a
    remote-wakeup signal is received, an external hub sends an interrupt
    message at the _end_ of the resume sequence but a root hub generates
    and interrupt at the _beginning_ of the resume sequence.  The host
    system must poll for the end of the sequence.
    
    When ehci-hcd was converted to interrupt-driven operation instead of
    using polling, the remaining need for this particular poll was
    overlooked.  This patch (as894) fixes the problem.

    skge: fix wake on lan
    
    Need to rework wake on lan code to setup properly and get activated
    on shutdown (and suspend), not when ethtool is run.
    
    This does not need to go to stable queue because wake on lan
    was not even included in 2.6.20 (or earlier versions).

    ide: ugly messages trying to open CD drive with no media present
    
    I get the following error messages when trying to open a CD device
    (specifically, the Teac CD-ROM CD-224E) that has no media present:
    
    hda: packet command error: status=3D0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
    hda: packet command error: error=3D0x54 { AbortedCommand LastFailedSense=0x05 }
    ide: failed opcode was: unknown
    
    This happens when a "start stop unit" command (0x1b 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0)
    is sent to the drive to try to close the CD-ROM tray, but this drive
    doesn't have that capability (it's a slim portable-type CD-ROM), so it
    reports sense key 5 (illegal request) with asc/ascq 24/0.  This is
    exactly how SFF8090i says it should respond.
    
    But ide-cd.c (in cdrom_decode_status() ) just sees sense key 5 and spews
    out an error.  It then goes on to request sense data, and
    cdrom_log_sense() understands this error and doesn't log it.
    
    The patch, for kernel 2.6.20.4, suppresses this error message.

    ide: correctly prevent IDE timer expiry function to run if request was already handled
    
    It is possible for the timer expiry function to run even though the
    request has already been handled: ide_timer_expiry() only checks that
    the handler is not NULL, but it is possible that we have handled a
    request (thus clearing the handler) and then started a new request
    (thus starting the timer again, and setting a handler).
    
    A simple way to exhibit this is to set the DMA timeout to 1 jiffy and
    run dd: The kernel will panic after a few minutes because
    ide_timer_expiry() tries to add a timer when it's already active.
    
    To fix this, we simply add a request generation count that gets
    incremented at every interrupt, and check in ide_timer_expiry() that
    we have not already handled a new interrupt before running the expiry
    function.

    [TCP]: slow_start_after_idle should influence cwnd validation too
    
    For the cases that slow_start_after_idle are meant to deal
    with, it is almost a certainty that the congestion window
    tests will think the connection is application limited and
    we'll thus decrease the cwnd there too.  This defeats the
    whole point of setting slow_start_after_idle to zero.
    
    So test it there too.
    
    We do not cancel out the entire tcp_cwnd_validate() function
    so that if the sysctl is changed we still have the validation
    state maintained.

    Nevertheless, a strong deprecation of this ABI makes a lot of sense,

    [PATCH] omap_cf: oops-on-suspend fix
    
    Convert omap_cf into a platform_driver ...  this resolves oopsing during
    suspend/resume.
    
    Evidently folk haven't tried suspend/resume on an OSK (the main platform
    for this driver) since September or so, which is when platform_device
    learned about suspend_late()/resume_early() and stopped being able to
    suspend/resume without a platform_driver.

    [PATCH] Proper fix for highmem kmap_atomic functions for VMI for 2.6.21
    
    Since lazy MMU batching mode still allows interrupts to enter, it is
    possible for interrupt handlers to try to use kmap_atomic, which fails when
    lazy mode is active, since the PTE update to highmem will be delayed.  The
    best workaround is to issue an explicit flush in kmap_atomic_functions
    case; this is the only way nested PTE updates can happen in the interrupt
    handler.
    
    Thanks to Jeremy Fitzhardinge for noting the bug and suggestions on a fix.
    
    This patch gets reverted again when we start 2.6.22 and the bug gets fixed
    differently.

    [PATCH] sched: get rid of p->children use in show_task()
    
    the p->parent PID printout gives us all the information about the
    task tree that we need - the eldest_child()/older_sibling()/
    younger_sibling() printouts are mostly historic and i do not
    remember ever having used those fields. (IMO in fact they confuse
    the SysRq-T output.) So remove them.
    
    This code has sentimental value though, those fields and
    printouts are one of the oldest ones still surviving from
    Linux v0.95's kernel/sched.c:
    
            if (p->p_ysptr || p->p_osptr)
                    printk("   Younger sib=%d, older sib=%d\n\r",
                            p->p_ysptr ? p->p_ysptr->pid : -1,
                            p->p_osptr ? p->p_osptr->pid : -1);
            else
                    printk("\n\r");

    IB/iser: Don't defer connection failure notification to workqueue
    
    When a connection is terminated asynchronously from the iSCSI layer's
    perspective, iSER needs to notify the iSCSI layer that the connection
    has failed.  This is done using a workqueue (switched to from the iSER
    tasklet context).  Meanwhile, the connection object (that holds the
    work struct) is released.  If the workqueue function wasn't called
    yet, it will be called later with a NULL pointer, which will crash the
    kernel.
    
    The context switch (tasklet to workqueue) is not required, and
    everything can be done from the iSER tasklet. This eliminates the NULL
    work struct bug (and simplifies the code).

    HID: Do not discard truncated input reports
    
    Truncated reports should not be discarded since it prevents buggy

    Prior to the regession introduced in 2.6.20, a shorter-than-expected
    report in hid_input_report() was passed thru after having the missing
    bytes cleared. This behavior was established over a few patches in the
    2.6.early-teens days, including commit
    cd6104572bca9e4afe0dcdb8ecd65ef90b01297b.

    [APPLETALK]: Fix a remotely triggerable crash
    
    When we receive an AppleTalk frame shorter than what its header says,
    we still attempt to verify its checksum, and trip on the BUG_ON() at
    the end of function atalk_sum_skb() because of the length mismatch.
    
    This has security implications because this can be triggered by simply
    sending a specially crafted ethernet frame to a target victim,
    effectively crashing that host. Thus this qualifies, I think, as a
    remote DoS. Here is the frame I used to trigger the crash, in npg
    format:
    
    <Appletalk Killer>
    {
    # Ethernet header -----
    
      XX XX XX XX XX XX  # Destination MAC
      00 00 00 00 00 00  # Source MAC
      00 1D              # Length
    
    # LLC header -----
    
      AA AA 03
      08 00 07 80 9B  # Appletalk
    
    # Appletalk header -----
    
      00 1B        # Packet length (invalid)
      00 01        # Fake checksum
      00 00 00 00  # Destination and source networks
      00 00 00 00  # Destination and source nodes and ports
    
    # Payload -----
    
      0C 0D 0E 0F 10 11 12 13
      14
    }
    
    The destination MAC address must be set to those of the victim.
    
    The severity is mitigated by two requirements:
    * The target host must have the appletalk kernel module loaded. I
      suspect this isn't so frequent.
    * AppleTalk frames are non-IP, thus I guess they can only travel on
      local networks. I am no network expert though, maybe it is possible
      to somehow encapsulate AppleTalk packets over IP.
    
    The bug has been reported back in June 2004:
      http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2979
    But it wasn't investigated, and was closed in July 2006 as both
    reporters had vanished meanwhile.
    
    This code was new in kernel 2.6.0-test5:
      http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/tglx/history.git;a=commitdiff;h=7ab442d7e0a76402c12553ee256f756097cae2d2
    And not modified since then, so we can assume that vanilla kernels
    2.6.0-test5 and later, and distribution kernels based thereon, are
    affected.
    
    Note that I still do not know for sure what triggered the bug in the
    real-world cases. The frame could have been corrupted by the kernel if
    we have a bug hiding somewhere. But more likely, we are receiving the
    faulty frame from the network.

    [PATCH] fix jiffies clocksource inittime
    
    In debugging a problem w/ the -rt tree, I noticed that on systems that mark
    the tsc as unstable before it is registered, the TSC would still be
    selected and used for a short period of time.  Digging in it looks to be a
    result of the mix of the clocksource list changes and my clocksource
    initialization changes.
    
    With the -rt tree, using a bad TSC, even for a short period of time can
    results in a hang at boot.  I was not able to reproduce this hang w/
    mainline, but I'm not completely certain that someone won't trip on it.
    
    This patch resolves the issue by initializing the jiffies clocksource
    earlier so a bad TSC won't get selected just because nothing else is yet
    registered.

    [PATCH] remove protection of LANANA-reserved majors
    
    Revert all this.  It can cause device-mapper to receive a different major from
    earlier kernels and it turns out that the Amanda backup program (via GNU tar,
    apparently) checks major numbers on files when performing incremental backups.
    
    Which is a bit broken of Amanda (or tar), but this feature isn't important
    enough to justify the churn.

    [PATCH] net: Ignore sysfs network device rename bugs.
    
    The generic networking code ensures that no two networking devices
    have the same name, so  there is no time except when sysfs has
    implementation bugs that device_rename when called from
    dev_change_name will fail.
    
    The current error handling for errors from device_rename in
    dev_change_name is wrong and results in an unusable and unrecoverable
    network device if device_rename is happens to return an error.
    
    This patch removes the buggy error handling.  Which confines the mess
    when device_rename hits a problem to sysfs, instead of propagating it
    the rest of the network stack.  Making linux a little more robust.
    
    Without this patch you can observe what happens when sysfs has a bug
    when CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED is not set and you attempt to rename
    a real network device to a name like (broken_parity_status, device,
    modalias, power, resource2, subsystem_vendor, class,  driver, irq,
    msi_bus, resource, subsystem, uevent, config, enable, local_cpus,
    numa_node, resource0, subsystem_device, vendor)
    
    Greg has a patch that fixes the sysfs bugs but he doesn't trust it
    for a 2.6.21 timeframe.  This patch which just ignores errors should
    be safe and it keeps the system from going completely wacky.

    [S390] page_mkclean data corruption.
    
    The git commit c2fda5fed81eea077363b285b66eafce20dfd45a which
    added the page_test_and_clear_dirty call to page_mkclean and the
    git commit 7658cc289288b8ae7dd2c2224549a048431222b3 which fixes
    the "nasty and subtle race in shared mmap'ed page writeback"
    problem in clear_page_dirty_for_io cause data corruption on s390.
    
    The effect of the two changes is that for every call to
    clear_page_dirty_for_io a page_test_and_clear_dirty is done. If
    the per page dirty bit is set set_page_dirty is called. Strangly
    clear_page_dirty_for_io is called for not-uptodate pages, e.g.
    over this call-chain:
    
     [<000000000007c0f2>] clear_page_dirty_for_io+0x12a/0x130
     [<000000000007c494>] generic_writepages+0x258/0x3e0
     [<000000000007c692>] do_writepages+0x76/0x7c
     [<00000000000c7a26>] __writeback_single_inode+0xba/0x3e4
     [<00000000000c831a>] sync_sb_inodes+0x23e/0x398
     [<00000000000c8802>] writeback_inodes+0x12e/0x140
     [<000000000007b9ee>] wb_kupdate+0xd2/0x178
     [<000000000007cca2>] pdflush+0x162/0x23c
    
    The bad news now is that page_test_and_clear_dirty might claim
    that a not-uptodate page is dirty since SetPageUptodate which
    resets the per page dirty bit has not yet been called. The page
    writeback that follows clobbers the data on disk.
    
    The simplest solution to this problem is to move the call to
    page_test_and_clear_dirty under the "if (page_mapped(page))".
    If a file backed page is mapped it is uptodate.

    2.6.21 fix lba48 bug in libata fill_result_tf()
    
    Current 2.6.21 libata does the following:
    
    void ata_tf_read(struct ata_port *ap, struct ata_taskfile *tf)
    {
            struct ata_ioports *ioaddr = &ap->ioaddr;
    
            tf->command = ata_check_status(ap);
    	...
            if (tf->flags & ATA_TFLAG_LBA48) {
                    iowrite8(tf->ctl | ATA_HOB, ioaddr->ctl_addr);
                    tf->hob_feature = ioread8(ioaddr->error_addr);
                    ...
            }
    }
    ...
    static void fill_result_tf(struct ata_queued_cmd *qc)
    {
            struct ata_port *ap = qc->ap;
    
            ap->ops->tf_read(ap, &qc->result_tf);
            qc->result_tf.flags = qc->tf.flags;
    }
    
    Based on this, those last two statements fill_result_tf()
    appear to me to be in the wrong order, in that the tf->flags
    are uninitialized at the point where tf_read() is invoked.
    So for lba48 commands, tf_read() won't be reading back the
    full lba48 register contents..
    
    Correct?
    
    This patch corrects fill_result_tf() so that the flags
    get copied to result_tf before they are used by tf_read().

    b44: fix IFF_ALLMULTI handling of CAM slots
    
    If you set the IFF_ALLMULTI flag on a b44 device, or if you join more than
    B44_MCAST_TABLE_SIZE multicast groups, the device will stop receiving unicast
    messages.  This is because the __b44_set_mac_addr call sets the zeroth CAM
    entry to the MAC address of the device, and then the loop at line 1722
    proceeds to overwrite it unless the value of i is set by the __b44_load_mcast
    call.  However, when IFF_ALLMULTI is set, that call is bypassed, leaving i set
    to zero.
    
    Fixed by starting the loop at 1 to make it skip the CAM entry for the MAC
    address.

    [PATCH] msi: synchronously mask and unmask msi-x irqs.
    
    This is a simplified and actually more comprehensive form of a bug
    fix from Mitch Williams <mitch.a.williams@intel.com>.
    
    When we mask or unmask a msi-x irqs the writes may be posted because
    we are writing to memory mapped region.  This means the mask and
    unmask don't happen immediately but at some unspecified time in the
    future.  Which is out of sync with how the mask/unmask logic work
    for ioapic irqs.
    
    The practical result is that we get very subtle and hard to track down
    irq migration bugs.
    
    This patch performs a read flush after writes to the MSI-X table for mask
    and unmask operations.  Since the SMP affinity is set while the interrupt
    is masked, and since it's unmasked immediately after, no additional flushes
    are required in the various affinity setting routines.
    
    The testing by Mitch Williams on his especially problematic system should
    still be valid as I have only simplified the code, not changed the
    functionality.
    
    We currently have 7 drivers: cciss, mthca, cxgb3, forceth, s2io,
    pcie/portdrv_core, and qla2xxx in 2.6.21 that are affected by this
    problem when the hardware they driver is plugged into the right slot.
    
    Given the difficulty of reproducing this bug and tracing it down to
    anything that even remotely resembles a cause, even if people are
    being affected we aren't likely to see many meaningful bug reports, and
    the people who see this bug aren't likely to be able to reproduce this
    bug in a timely fashion.  So it is best to get this problem fixed
    as soon as we can so people don't have problems.
    
    Then if people do have a kernel message stating "No irq for vector" we
    will know it is yet another novel cause that needs a complete new
    investigation.

    [SCSI]: Fix scsi_send_eh_cmnd scatterlist handling
    
    This fixes a regression caused by commit:
    
    2dc611de5a3fd955cd0298c50691d4c05046db97
    
    The sense buffer code in scsi_send_eh_cmnd was changed to use
    alloc_page() and a scatter list, but the sense data copy was not
    updated to match so what we actually get in the sense buffer is total
    grabage starting with the kernel address of the struct page we got.
    Basically the stack frame of scsi_send_eh_cmd() is what ends up
    in the sense buffer.
    
    Depending upon how pointers look on a given platform, you can
    end up getting sr_ioctl.c errors when you mount a cdrom.  If
    the CDROM gives a check condition for GPCMD_GET_CONFIGURATION issued
    by drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c:cdrom_mmc_profile(), sr_ioctl will
    spit out this error message in sr_do_ioctl() with the way pointers
    are on sparc64:
    
    		default:
    			printk(KERN_ERR "%s: CDROM (ioctl) error, command: ", cd->cdi.name);
    			__scsi_print_command(cgc->cmd);
    			scsi_print_sense_hdr("sr", &sshdr);
    			err = -EIO;
    
    This is the error Tom Callaway reported in:
    
    http://marc.info/?l=linux-sparc&m=117407453208101&w=2
    
    Anyways, fix this by using page_address(sgl.page) which is OK
    because we know this is low-mem due to GFP_ATOMIC.

    Dave, we use "int" for returning value,
    so we should fix this anyway, IMHO;

    [PATCH] i386: fix file_read_actor() and pipe_read() for original i386 systems
    
    The __copy_to_user_inatomic() calls in file_read_actor() and pipe_read()
    are broken on original i386 machines, where WP-works-ok == false, as
    __copy_to_user_inatomic() on such systems calls functions which might
    sleep and/or contain cond_resched() calls inside of a kmap_atomic()
    region.
    
    The original check for WP-works-ok was in access_ok(), but got moved
    during the 2.5 series to fix a race vs. swap.
    
    Return the number of bytes to copy in the case where we are in an atomic
    region, so the non atomic code pathes in file_read_actor() and
    pipe_read() are taken.
    
    This could be optimized to avoid the kmap_atomicby moving the check for
    WP-works-ok into fault_in_pages_writeable(), but this is more intrusive
    and can be done later.

    [PATCH] Fix microcode-related suspend problem
    
    Fix the regression resulting from the recent change of suspend code
    ordering that causes systems based on Intel x86 CPUs using the microcode
    driver to hang during the resume.
    
    The problem occurs since the microcode driver uses request_firmware() in
    its CPU hotplug notifier, which is called after tasks has been frozen and
    hangs.  It can be fixed by telling the microcode driver to use the
    microcode stored in memory during the resume instead of trying to load it
    from disk.

    "Unexpected file size increasing."
    
       Call trace the same as it was in first issue but result is different.
       For example we have file with i_size is zero.  we want write two blocks ,
       but fs has only one free block.
    
       ->ext3_prepare_write(...from == 0, to == 2048)
         retry:
         ->block_prepare_write() == -ENOSPC# we failed but allocated one block here.
         ->ext3_prepare_failure()
           ->commit_write( from == 0, to == 1024) # after this i_size becomes 1024 :)
         if (ret == -ENOSPC && ext3_should_retry_alloc(inode->i_sb, &retries))
            goto retry;
    
       Finally when all retries will be spended ext3_prepare_failure return
       -ENOSPC, but i_size was increased and later block trimm procedures can't
       help here.
    
    We don't appear to have the horsepower to fix these issues, so let's put
    things back the way they were for now.

    [PATCH] CPUSETS: add mems to basic usage documentation
    
    It seems that there must be at least one node in mems and at least one CPU
    in cpus in order to be able to assign tasks to a cpuset.  This makes sense.
     And I think it would also make sense to include a mems setting in the
    basic usage section of the documentation.
    
    I also wonder if something logged to dmsg, explaining why a write failed,
    would be a good enhancement.  I ended up having rummage arround in cpuset.c
    in order to work out why my configuration was failing.

    [PATCH] uml: fix unreasonably long udelay
    
    Currently we have a confused udelay implementation.
    
    * __const_udelay does not accept usecs but xloops in i386 and x86_64
    * our implementation requires usecs as arg
    * it gets a xloops count when called by asm/arch/delay.h
    
    Bugs related to this (extremely long shutdown times) where reported by some
    x86_64 users, especially using Device Mapper.
    
    To hit this bug, a compile-time constant time parameter must be passed -
    that's why UML seems to work most times.  Fix this with a simple udelay
    implementation.

    [PATCH] x86-64: Disable local APIC timer use on AMD systems with C1E
    
    AMD dual core laptops with C1E do not run the APIC timer correctly
    when they go idle. Previously the code assumed this only happened
    on C2 or deeper.  But not all of these systems report support C2.
    
    Use a AMD supplied snippet to detect C1E being enabled and then disable
    local apic timer use.
    
    This supercedes an earlier workaround using DMI detection of specific systems.
    
    Thanks to Mark Langsdorf for the detection snippet.

    [ARM] 4298/1: fix memory barriers for DMA coherent and SMP platforms
    
    This patch:
    - Switches mb/rmb/wmb back to being full-blown DMBs on ARM SMP systems,
      since mb/rmb/wmb are required to order Normal memory accesses as well.
    - Enables the use of DMB and ISB on XSC3 (which is an ARMv5TE ISA core
      but conforms to the ARMv6 memory ordering model and supports the
      various ARMv6 barriers.)
    - Makes DMA coherent platforms (only ixp23xx at the moment) map
      mb/rmb/wmb to dmb(), as on DMA coherent platforms, DMA consistent
      mappings are done as Normal mappings, which are weakly ordered.

    This patch addresses the following issues with the pxa2xx FIr driver:
    
    1. increment overrun error counter and not frame error counter on ICSR1_ROR bit set in ICSR1.
    2. drop frames reported with the frame error from the IC.
    3. when resetting the receiver and preparing it for the next DMA in pxa_irda_fir_irq() actually clear the Rx FIFO. See description in Table 11-2 in PXA270 Developer's Manual of the RXE bit.
    
    Correction added in version 2: clearing the IC Rx FIFO also has to be done in pxa_irda_fir_dma_tx_irq()

    [PATCH] kbuild: fix dependency generation
    
    Commit 2e3646e51b2d6415549b310655df63e7e0d7a080 changed the way the
    split config tree is built, but failed to also adjust fixdep accordingly
    - if changing a config option from or to m, files referencing the
    respective CONFIG_..._MODULE (but not the corresponding CONFIG_...)
    didn't get rebuilt.
    
    The problem is that trisate symbol are represent with three different
    symbols:
        SYMBOL=n => no symbol defined
        SYMBOL=y => CONFIG_SYMBOL defined to '1'
        SYMBOL=m => CONFIG_SYMBOL_MODULE defined to '1'
    
    But conf_split_config do not distingush between the =y and =m case, so
    only the =y case is honoured.
    
    This is fixed in fixdep so when a CONFIG symbol with _MODULE is found we
    skip that part and only look for the CONFIG_SYMBOL version.

    The recursion does abort when there is no more IPI queued for a CPU, so

    [IA64] bugfix stack layout upside-down
    
    ia64 expects following vm layout:
    
    == low memory
    [register-stack grows up]
    [memory-stack grows down]
    == high memory
    
    But the code assigns the base of the register stack at the
    maximum stack size offset from the fixed address where the
    stack *might* start.  Stack randomization will result in the
    memory stack starting at a lower address than this, and if the
    user has set a low stack limit with "ulimit -s", then you can
    end up with the register stack above the memory stack (or if
    you were very unlucky right on top of it!).
    
    Fix: Calculate the base address for the register stack starting
    from the actual address of the memory stack.

    [PATCH] holepunch: fix mmap_sem i_mutex deadlock
    
    sys_madvise has down_write of mmap_sem, then madvise_remove calls
    vmtruncate_range which takes i_mutex and i_alloc_sem: no, we can easily devise
    deadlocks from that ordering.
    
    madvise_remove drop mmap_sem while calling vmtruncate_range: luckily, since
    madvise_remove doesn't split or merge vmas, it's easy to handle this case with
    a NULL prev, without restructuring sys_madvise.  (Though sad to retake
    mmap_sem when it's unlikely to be needed, and certainly down_read is
    sufficient for MADV_REMOVE, unlike the other madvices.)

    [PATCH] holepunch: fix disconnected pages after second truncate
    
    shmem_truncate_range has its own truncate_inode_pages_range, to free any pages
    racily instantiated while it was in progress: a SHMEM_PAGEIN flag is set when
    this might have happened.  But holepunching gets no chance to clear that flag
    at the start of vmtruncate_range, so it's always set (unless a truncate came
    just before), so holepunch almost always does this second
    truncate_inode_pages_range.
    
    shmem holepunch has unlikely swap<->file races hereabouts whatever we do
    (without a fuller rework than is fit for this release): I was going to skip
    the second truncate in the punch_hole case, but Miklos points out that would
    make holepunch correctness more vulnerable to swapoff.  So keep the second
    truncate, but follow it by an unmap_mapping_range to eliminate the
    disconnected pages (freed from pagecache while still mapped in userspace) that
    it might have left behind.

    [PATCH] holepunch: fix shmem_truncate_range punch locking
    
    Miklos Szeredi observes that during truncation of shmem page directories,
    info->lock is released to improve latency (after lowering i_size and
    next_index to exclude races); but this is quite wrong for holepunching, which
    receives no such protection from i_size or next_index, and is left vulnerable
    to races with shmem_unuse, shmem_getpage and shmem_writepage.
    
    Hold info->lock throughout when holepunching?  No, any user could prevent
    rescheduling for far too long.  Instead take info->lock just when needed: in
    shmem_free_swp when removing the swap entries, and whenever removing a
    directory page from the level above.  But so long as we remove before
    scanning, we can safely skip taking the lock at the lower levels, except at
    misaligned start and end of the hole.

    [PATCH] holepunch: fix shmem_truncate_range punching too far
    
    Miklos Szeredi observes BUG_ON(!entry) in shmem_writepage() triggered in rare
    circumstances, because shmem_truncate_range() erroneously removes partially
    truncated directory pages at the end of the range: later reclaim on pages
    pointing to these removed directories triggers the BUG.  Indeed, and it can
    also cause data loss beyond the hole.
    
    Fix this as in the patch proposed by Miklos, but distinguish between "limit"
    (how far we need to search: ignore truncation's next_index optimization in the
    holepunch case - if there are races it's more consistent to act on the whole
    range specified) and "upper_limit" (how far we can free directory pages:
    generally we must be careful to keep partially punched pages, but can relax at
    end of file - i_size being held stable by i_mutex).

    [PATCH] uml: fix LVM crash
    
    Permit lvm to create logical volumes without crashing UML.
    
    When device-mapper's DM_DEV_CREATE_CMD ioctl is called to create a new device,
    dev_create()->dm_create()->alloc_dev()-> blk_queue_bounce_limit(md->queue,
    BLK_BOUNCE_ANY) is called.
    
    blk_queue_bounce_limit(BLK_BOUNCE_ANY) calls init_emergency_isa_pool() if
    blk_max_pfn < blk_max_low_pfn.  This is the case on UML, but
    init_emergency_isa_pool() hits BUG_ON(!isa_page_pool) because there doesn't
    seem to be a dma zone on UML for mempool_create() to allocate from.
    
    Most architectures seem to have max_low_pfn == max_pfn, but UML doesn't
    because of the uml_reserved chunk it keeps for itself.  From what I can see,
    max_pfn and max_low_pfn don't get much use after the bootmem-allocator stops
    being used anyway, except that they initialize the block layer's
    blk_max_low_pfn/blk_max_pfn.
    
    This ensures init_emergency_isa_pool() doesn't crash uml in this situation by
    setting max_low_pfn == max_pfn in mem_init().

    [PATCH] uml: irq locking fixes
    
    As the comment immediately preceding this points out, this list is changed in
    irq context, so it needs to be protected with spin_lock_irqsave in process
    context when it is processed.
    
    Sometimes, gcc should just compile the comments and forget the code.
    
    The IRQ side of this was better, in the sense that it blocked and unblocked
    interrupts, but it still should have saved and restored them.

    [PATCH] uml: fix I/O hang when multiple devices are in use
    
    Commit 62f96cb01e8de7a5daee472e540f726db2801499 introduced per-devices
    queues and locks, which was fine as far as it went, but left in place a
    global which controlled access to submitting requests to the host.  This
    should have been made per-device as well, since it causes I/O hangs when
    multiple block devices are in use.
    
    This patch fixes that by replacing the global with an activity flag in the
    device structure in order to tell whether the queue is currently being run.

    [PATCH] bluetooth hid quirks: mightymouse quirk
    
    I have a bugreport that scrollwheel of bluetooth version of apple
    mightymouse doesn't work.  The USB version of mightymouse works, as there
    is a quirk for handling scrollwheel in hid/usbhid for it.
    
    Now that bluetooth git tree is hooked to generic hid layer, it could easily
    use the quirks which are already present in generic hid parser, hid-input,
    etc.
    
    Below is a simple patch against bluetooth git tree, which adds quirk
    handling to current bluetooth hidp code, and sets quirk flags for device
    0x05ac/0x030c, which is the bluetooth version of the apple mightymouse.

    [PATCH] pid: Properly detect orphaned process groups in exit_notify
    
    In commit 0475ac0845f9295bc5f69af45f58dff2c104c8d1 when converting the
    orphaned process group handling to use struct pid I made a small
    mistake.  I accidentally replaced an == with a !=.
    
    Besides just being a dumb thing to do apparently this has a bad side
    effect.  The improper orphaned process group detection causes kwin to
    die after a suspend/resume cycle.
    
    I'm amazed this patch has been around as long as it has without anyone
    else noticing something funny going on.
    
    And the following people deserve credit for spotting and helping
    to reproduce this.

    Some atl1 boards get their MAC address written directly to the register
    by the BIOS during POST, rather than storing it in EEPROM that's
    accessible to the driver.  If the MAC register on one of these boards
    is changed and then the module is unloaded, the permanent MAC address
    will be forgotten until the box is rebooted.  We should save the
    permanent address during removal if we've been messing with it.

    [PATCH] MSI-X: fix resume crash
    
    So I think the right solution is to simply make pci_enable_device just
    flip enable bits and move the rest of the work someplace else.
    
    However a thorough cleanup is a little extreme for this point in the
    release cycle, so I think a quick hack that makes the code not stomp the
    irq when msi irq's are enabled should be the first fix.  Then we can
    later make the code not change the irqs at all.

    hrtimer_start() incorrectly set the 'reprogram' flag to enqueue_hrtimer(),
    which should only be 1 if the hrtimer is queued to the current CPU.
    
    Doing otherwise could result in a reprogramming of the current CPU's
    clockevents device, with a timer that is not queued to it - resulting in a
    bogus next expiry value.

    mv643xx_eth: Fix use of uninitialized port_num field
    
    In this driver, the default ethernet address is first set by by calling
    eth_port_uc_addr_get() which reads the relevant registers of the
    corresponding port as initially set by firmware. However that function
    used the port_num field accessed through the private area of net_dev
    before it was set.
    
    The result was that one board I have ended up with the unicast address
    set to 00:00:00:00:00:00 (only port 1 is connected on this board). The
    problem appeared after commit 84dd619e4dc3b0b1c40dafd98c90fd950bce7bc5.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by setting mp->port_num prior to calling
    eth_port_uc_get_addr().

    ahci.c: walkaround for SB600 SATA internal error issue
    
       There is a HW issue in ATI SB600 SATA that PxSERR.E should not be
    set on some conditions, for example, when there is no media in SATA
    CD/DVD drive or media is not ready, AHCI controller fails to execute
    ATAPI commands and reports PORT_IRQ_TF_ERR, but ATI SB600 SATA
    controller sets PxSERR.E at the
    same time, which is not necessary.
        This patch is just to ignore the INTERNAL ERROR in such case.
    Without this patch, ahci error handler will report many errors as

    These are changed in the specifications on 2/13/07 and now use "analog" instead
    instead of "version" to help reduce confusion.

    [PATCH] Revert "swsusp: disable nonboot CPUs before entering platform suspend"
    
    This reverts commit 94985134b7b46848267ed6b734320db01c974e72 and
    insteads removes the WARN_ON() that caused that commit in the first
    place.
    
    The problem is that we call disable_nonboot_cpus() in swsusp before
    powering down the system in order to avoid triggering the WARN_ON()
    in arch/x86_64/kernel/acpi/sleep.c:init_low_mapping() and this doesn't
    work well on Thomas' system.
    
    So instead, remove the WARN_ON() in arch/x86_64/kernel/acpi/sleep.c:
    init_low_mapping(), which triggers every time during the suspend to disk
    in the platform mode, as the potential problem it is related to doesn't
    seem to occur in practice.
    
    [ I think we might want to disallow the case of multiple users of that
      mm, or something.  Normally, playing with the current process page
      tables on the current CPU should be fine as long as we don't have
      other threads using those tables at the same time..
    
      Anyway, not pretty, but better than the warning or the lockup - Linus ]

    [PATCH] i2o: block IO errors on i2o disk
    
    I2O subsystem has been broken in mainstream several months ago (after
    2.6.18).  Commit 4aff5e2333c9a1609662f2091f55c3f6fffdad36 from Jens
    Axboe split struct request ->flags into two parts: cmd_type and
    cmd_flags.
    
    In i2o layer this patch has replaced flag REQ_SPECIAL by the according
    cmd_type.  However i2o has used REQ_SPECIAL not as command type but as
    driver-specific flag for the debug purposes.  As result all i2o requests
    have type "special" now, are not processed to the hardware and fail with
    I/O error:
    
       i2o/hda:<3>Buffer I/O error on device i2o/hda, logical block 0
      Buffer I/O error on device i2o/hda, logical block 0
      Buffer I/O error on device i2o/hda, logical block 0
       unable to read partition table
      block-osm: device added (TID: 207): i2o/hda
    
    The following patch removes the extra debug checks without any drawbacks and
    restores the normal driver's work.

    [PATCH] ntp: avoid time_offset overflows
    
    I've been seeing some odd NTP behavior recently on a few boxes and
    finally narrowed it down to time_offset overflowing when converted to
    SHIFT_UPDATE units (which was a side effect from my HZfreeNTP patch).
    
    This patch converts time_offset from a long to a s64 which resolves the
    issue.

    [PATCH] uml: use correct register file size everywhere
    
    This patch uses MAX_REG_NR consistently to refer to the register file size.
     FRAME_SIZE isn't sufficient because on x86_64, it is smaller than the
    ptrace register file size.  MAX_REG_NR was introduced as a consistent way
    to get the number of registers, but wasn't used everywhere it should be.
    
    When this causes a problem, it makes PTRACE_SETREGS fail on x86_64 because
    of a corrupted segment register value in the known-good register file.  The
    patch also adds a register dump at that point in case there are any future
    problems here.

    [PATCH] correct slow acpi_pm rating
    
    On Bob's machine clocksource is selecting PIT over the ACPI PM timer,
    because he has the PIIX4 bug.  That bug drops the ACPI PM timers rating
    to the same as the PIT, so that's why you're getting the PIT.
    
    Realistically, the PIT is much slower then even the triple read ACPI PM,
    so the de-ranking code is probably dropping it too far.
    
    So don't drop ACPI PM quite so low if we see the PIIX4 bug.

    KVM: always reload segment selectors
    
    failed VM entry on VMX might still change %fs or %gs, thus make sure
    that KVM always reloads the segment selectors. This is crutial on both
    x86 and x86_64: x86 has __KERNEL_PDA in %fs on which things like
    'current' depends and x86_64 has 0 there and needs MSR_GS_BASE to work.

    KVM: Prevent system selectors leaking into guest on real->protected mode transition on vmx
    
    Intel virtualization extensions do not support virtualizing real mode.  So
    kvm uses virtualized vm86 mode to run real mode code.  Unfortunately, this
    virtualized vm86 mode does not support the so called "big real" mode, where
    the segment selector and base do not agree with each other according to the
    real mode rules (base == selector << 4).
    
    To work around this, kvm checks whether a selector/base pair violates the
    virtualized vm86 rules, and if so, forces it into conformance.  On a
    transition back to protected mode, if we see that the guest did not touch
    a forced segment, we restore it back to the original protected mode value.
    
    This pile of hacks breaks down if the gdt has changed in real mode, as it
    can cause a segment selector to point to a system descriptor instead of a
    normal data segment.  In fact, this happens with the Windows bootloader
    and the qemu acpi bios, where a protected mode memcpy routine issues an
    innocent 'pop %es' and traps on an attempt to load a system descriptor.
    
    "Fix" by checking if the to-be-restored selector points at a system segment,
    and if so, coercing it into a normal data segment.  The long term solution,
    of course, is to abandon vm86 mode and use emulation for big real mode.

    2/2 splice: dont readpage
    
    Splice does not need to readpage to bring the page uptodate before writing

    Splice is also wrong to SetPageUptodate before the page is actually uptodate.

    1/2 splice: dont steal
    
    Stealing pages with splice is problematic because we cannot just insert
    an uptodate page into the pagecache and hope the filesystem can take care
    of it later.
    
    We also cannot just ClearPageUptodate, then hope prepare_write does not
    write anything into the page, because I don't think prepare_write gives
    that guarantee.
    
    Remove support for SPLICE_F_MOVE for now. If we really want to bring it
    back, we might be able to do so with a the new filesystem buffered write
    aops APIs I'm working on. If we really don't want to bring it back, then
    we should decide that sooner rather than later, and remove the flag and
    all the stealing infrastructure before anybody starts using it.

    block: blk_max_pfn is somtimes wrong
    
    There is a small problem in handling page bounce.
    
    At the moment blk_max_pfn equals max_pfn, which is in fact not maximum
    possible _number_ of a page frame, but the _amount_ of page frames.  For
    example for the 32bit x86 node with 4Gb RAM, max_pfn = 0x100000, but not
    0xFFFF.
    
    request_queue structure has a member q->bounce_pfn and queue needs bounce
    pages for the pages _above_ this limit.  This routine is handled by
    blk_queue_bounce(), where the following check is produced:
    
    	if (q->bounce_pfn >= blk_max_pfn)
    		return;
    
    Assume, that a driver has set q->bounce_pfn to 0xFFFF, but blk_max_pfn
    equals 0x10000.  In such situation the check above fails and for each bio
    we always fall down for iterating over pages tied to the bio.
    
    I want to notice, that for quite a big range of device drivers (ide, md,
    ...) such problem doesn't happen because they use BLK_BOUNCE_ANY for
    bounce_pfn.  BLK_BOUNCE_ANY is defined as blk_max_pfn << PAGE_SHIFT, and
    then the check above doesn't fail.  But for other drivers, which obtain
    reuired value from drivers, it fails.  For example sata_nv uses
    ATA_DMA_MASK or dev->dma_mask.
    
    I propose to use (max_pfn - 1) for blk_max_pfn.  And the same for
    blk_max_low_pfn.  The patch also cleanses some checks related with
    bounce_pfn.

    ocfs2_dlm: Check for migrateable lockres in dlm_empty_lockres()
    
    In dlm_migrate_lockres(), we check upfront whether the lockres is a
    candidate for migration. This patch encapsulates that code in a separate
    function so that dlm_empty_lockres() can also use it during umount. This
    patch addresses the umount process spinning problem.

    ocfs2_dlm: Fix lockres ref counting bug
    
    During umount, the umount thread migrates the lockres' and the dlm_thread
    frees the empty lockres'. Due to a race, the reference counting on the
    lockres goes awry leading to extra puts.

    IB/iser: Handle aborting a command after it is sent
    
    The SCSI midlayer may abort a command that was already sent.  If the
    initiator is still trying to send the command (or data-out PDUs for
    that command), the QP may time out after the midlayer times
    out. Therefore, when aborting the command, iSER may still have
    references for the command's buffers.  When sending these PDUs, the
    sends will complete with an error and their resources will be released
    then.

    USB: omap_udc: workaround dma_free_coherent() bogosity
    
    Various fixes to omap_udc, noted with some recent testing:
    
     - Cope with some SMP-induced braindamage in ARM's dma_{alloc,free}_coherent()
       implementation: alloc() can be called with IRQs blocked, but since late
       last year that's no longer true for free().  This resolves really NASTY
       problems with logspamming via WARN_ON(), indicating N-page leaks.
    
     - Be more correct in handling GET_STATUS request for RECIP_ENDPOINT ... the
       previous code only handled RECIP_INTERFACE, this version should be correct
       except for (sigh) bulk/interrupt endpoints.
    
     - Provide a better name for the function reporting whether the board has
       vbus sensing wired up.
    
    GET_STATUS requests for endpoint status still acts strangely though, at least
    given one flakey host doesn't always ack the first DATA packet, then the packet
    that gets retransmitted doesn't have data!

    ide: use correct IDE error recovery
    
    IDE error recovery is using IDLE IMMEDIATE if the drive is busy or has DRQ set.
    This violates the ATA spec (can only send IDLEÂ IMMEDIATE when drive is not
    busy) and really hoses up some drives (modern drives will not be able to
    recover using this error handling).  The correct thing to do is issue a SRST
    followed by a SET FEATURES command.  This is what Western Digital recommends
    for error recovery and what Western Digital says Windows does. Â ItÂ also does
    not violate the ATA spec as far as I can tell.
    
    Bart:
    * port the patch over the current tree
    * undo the recalibration code removal
    * send SET FEATURES command after checking for good drive status
    * don't check whether the current request is of REQ_TYPE_ATA_{CMD,TASK}
      type because we need to send SET FEATURES before handling any requests
    * some pre-ATA4 drives require INITIALIZE DEVICE PARAMETERS command before
      other commands (except IDENTIFY) so send SET FEATURES only if there are
      no pending drive->special requests
    * update comments and patch description
    * any bugs introduced by this patch are mine and not Suleiman's :-)

    [ bart: the ressurection of 2 years old patch which slipped thru the cracks
      (thanks to Sergei Shtylyov for finding it) ]
    
    These is the patch to turn on pdc202xx_new for ATAPI DMA.  When testing, it
    works fine without the (request_bufflen % 256) workaround as needed in libata.
    ide-scsi filters out (pc->request_transfer % 1024) and use PIO, so the pdc202xx
    ATAPI DMA problem is avoid.  Both ide-cd and ide-scsi won't hit the ATAPI DMA
    problem on pdc202xx_new.

    ide: cosmetic adaption of drivers/ide/Kconfig concerning SATA
    
    Since especially Serial ATA has it's own menu point now, I guess we can
    change the description of the deprecated SATA driver as well, since the
    new libATA subsystem is not configured through a SCSI low-level driver
    anymore, but has it's own menu point.

    ide: fix locking for manual DMA enable/disable ("hdparm -d")
    
    Since hwif->ide_dma_check and hwif->ide_dma_on never queue any commands
    (ide_config_drive_speed() sets transfer mode using polling and has no error
    recovery) we are safe with setting hwgroup->busy for the time while DMA
    setting for a drive is changed (so it won't race against I/O commands in fly).
    
    I audited briefly all ->ide_dma_check/->ide_dma_on/->tuneproc/->speedproc
    implementations and they all look OK wrt to this change.
    
    This patch finally allowed me to close kernel bugzilla bug #8169
    (once again thanks to Patrick Horn for reporting the issue & testing patches).

    ide: revert "ide: fix drive side 80c cable check, take 2" for now
    
    "ide: fix drive side 80c cable check, take 2" patch from Tejun Heo (commit
    fab59375b9543f84d1714f7dd00f5d11e531bd3e) fixed 80c bit test (bit13 of word93)
    but we also need to fix master/slave IDENTIFY order (slave device should be
    probed first in order to make it release PDIAG- signal) and we should also
    check for pre-ATA3 slave devices (which may not release PDIAG- signal).
    
    [ Unfortunately the fact that IDE driver doesn't reset devices itself helps
      only a bit as it seems that some BIOS-es reset ATA devices after programming
      the chipset, some BIOS-es can be set to not probe/configure selected devices,
      there may be no BIOS in case of add-on cards etc. ]
    
    Since we are quite late in the release cycle and the required changes will
    affect a lot of systems just revert the fix for now.
    
    [ Please also see libata commit f31f0cc2f0b7527072d94d02da332d9bb8d7d94c. ]

    [S390] kprobes: Align probe address.
    
    Running a probe on s390 with a probe address that is not 4 byte aligned
    results in a Kernel BUG.  The problem is that the stura instruction used
    by swap_instruction requires the destination address to be 4 byte aligned.
    As stura only writes 4 bytes, aligning to the next 4 byte aligned address
    results in the breakpoint instruction being stored past the probe address.
    The fix is to align the address backward (to the previous 4 byte aligned
    address) and writing the two byte breakpoint instruction in the appropriate
    bytes.

    [S390] Fix TCP/UDP pseudo header checksum computation.
    
    git commit f994aae1bd8e4813d59a2ed64d17585fe42d03fc changed the
    function declaration of csum_tcpudp_nofold. Argument types were
    changed from unsigned long to __be32 (unsigned int). Therefore we
    lost the implicit type conversion that zeroed the upper half of the
    registers that are used to pass parameters. Since the inline assembly
    relied on this we ended up adding random values and wrong checksums
    were created.
    Showed only up on machines with more than 4GB since gcc produced code
    where the registers that are used to pass 'saddr' and 'daddr' previously
    contained addresses before calling this function.
    Fix this by using 32 bit arithmetics and convert code to C, since gcc
    produces better code than these hand-optimized versions.

    [TG3]: Exit irq handler during chip reset.
    
    On most tg3 chips, the memory enable bit in the PCI command register
    gets cleared during chip reset and must be restored before accessing
    PCI registers using memory cycles.  The chip does not generate
    interrupt during chip reset, but the irq handler can still be called
    because of irq sharing or irqpoll.  Reading a register in the irq
    handler can cause a master abort in this scenario and may result in a
    crash on some architectures.
    
    Use the TG3_FLAG_CHIP_RESETTING flag to tell the irq handler to exit
    without touching any registers.  The checking of the flag is in the
    "slow" path of the irq handler and will not affect normal performance.
    The msi handler is not shared and therefore does not require checking
    the flag.

    [IPV6]: Fix routing round-robin locking.
    
    As per RFC2461, section 6.3.6, item #2, when no routers on the
    matching list are known to be reachable or probably reachable we
    do round robin on those available routes so that we make sure
    to probe as many of them as possible to detect when one becomes
    reachable faster.
    
    Each routing table has a rwlock protecting the tree and the linked
    list of routes at each leaf.  The round robin code executes during
    lookup and thus with the rwlock taken as a reader.  A small local
    spinlock tries to provide protection but this does not work at all
    for two reasons:
    
    1) The round-robin list manipulation, as coded, goes like this (with
       read lock held):
    
    	walk routes finding head and tail
    
    	spin_lock();
    	rotate list using head and tail
    	spin_unlock();
    
       While one thread is rotating the list, another thread can
       end up with stale values of head and tail and then proceed
       to corrupt the list when it gets the lock.  This ends up causing
       the OOPS in fib6_add() later onthat many people have been hitting.
    
    2) All the other code paths that run with the rwlock held as
       a reader do not expect the list to change on them, they
       expect it to remain completely fixed while they hold the
       lock in that way.
    
    So, simply stated, it is impossible to implement this correctly using
    a manipulation of the list without violating the rwlock locking
    semantics.
    
    Reimplement using a per-fib6_node round-robin pointer.  This way we
    don't need to manipulate the list at all, and since the round-robin
    pointer can only ever point to real existing entries we don't need
    to perform any locking on the changing of the round-robin pointer
    itself.  We only need to reset the round-robin pointer to NULL when
    the entry it is pointing to is removed.
    
    The idea is from Thomas Graf and it is very similar to how this
    was implemented before the advanced router selection code when in.

    [NET]: Fix neighbour destructor handling.
    
    ->neigh_destructor() is killed (not used), replaced with
    ->neigh_cleanup(), which is called when neighbor entry goes to dead
    state. At this point everything is still valid: neigh->dev,
    neigh->parms etc.
    
    The device should guarantee that dead neighbor entries (neigh->dead !=
    0) do not get private part initialized, otherwise nobody will cleanup
    it.
    
    I think this is enough for ipoib which is the only user of this thing.
    Initialization private part of neighbor entries happens in ipib
    start_xmit routine, which is not reached when device is down.  But it
    would be better to add explicit test for neigh->dead in any case.

    [NET]: Fix fib_rules compatibility breakage
    
    Based upon a patch from Patrick McHardy.
    
    The fib_rules netlink attribute policy introduced in 2.6.19 broke
    userspace compatibilty. When specifying a rule with "from all"
    or "to all", iproute adds a zero byte long netlink attribute,
    but the policy requires all addresses to have a size equal to
    sizeof(struct in_addr)/sizeof(struct in6_addr), resulting in a
    validation error.
    
    Check attribute length of FRA_SRC/FRA_DST in the generic framework
    by letting the family specific rules implementation provide the
    length of an address. Report an error if address length is non
    zero but no address attribute is provided. Fix actual bug by
    checking address length for non-zero instead of relying on
    availability of attribute.

    The main goal of the initial patch (preventing to switch to highres/nohz

    [PATCH] dynticks: fix hrtimer rounding error in next_timer_interrupt
    
    The rework of next_timer_interrupt() fixed the timer wheel bugs, but
    invented a rounding error versus the next hrtimer event. This is caused
    by the conversion of the hrtimer internal representation to relative
    jiffies.
    
    This causes bug #8100:
    http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8100
    
    next_timer_interrupt() returns "now" in such a case and causes the code
    in tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick() to trigger the timer softirq, which is
    bogus as no timer is due for expiry. This results in an endless context
    switching between idle and ksoftirqd until a timer is due for expiry.
    
    Modify the hrtimer evaluation so that, it returns now + 1, when the
    conversion results in a delta < 1 jiffie.
    
    It's confirmed to resolve bug #8100

    [ARM] 4278/1: configure pxa27x I2C SCL as "input"
    
    It has been reported by Julian Deng that configuring the pxa27x i2c SCL line as output generates a short negative pulse on it during the call to pxa_gpio_mode(GPIO117_I2CSCL_MD); as it first switches it to output and then configures it for the alternate function. The SCL line is in fact bidirectional and can also be configured as 117 | GPIO_ALT_FN_1_IN, in which case the pulse is not generated. This is exactly what this patch does.

    [PATCH] i386: Prevent early access to TSC to avoid crash on TSCless systems
    
    commit f9690982b8c2f9a2c65acdc113e758ec356676a3 removed the check for
    cpu_khz from sched_clock(), which prevented early access to the TSC by
    non obvious magic.
    
    This is harmless as long as the CPU has a TSC. On TSCless systems this
    results in an illegal instruction trap.
    
    Replace tsc_disabled and tsc_unstable by tsc_enabled, which is only set
    when the tsc is available and not unstable.

    [PATCH] x86_64: avoid sending LOCAL_TIMER_VECTOR IPI to itself
    
    Ray Lee reported, that on an UP kernel with "noapic" command line option
    set, the box locks hard during boot.
    
    Adding some debug printks revealed, that the last action on the box
    before stalling was "Send IPI" - a debug printk which was put into
    smp_send_timer_broadcast_ipi().
    
    It seems that send_IPI_mask(mask, LOCAL_TIMER_VECTOR) fails when
    "noapic" is set on the command line on an UP kernel.
    
    Aside of that it does not make much sense to trigger an interrupt
    instead of calling the function directly on the CPU which gets the
    PIT/HPET interrupt in case of broadcasting.

    [PATCH] i386: clear segment register padding in core dumps
    
    The segment register slots in struct pt_regs are padded to 32 bits.
    Some of these are stored with instructions like "pushl %es", which
    leaves the high 16 bits as they were.  So the high bits of these
    fields in struct pt_regs contain kernel stack garbage.  These bits are
    ignored by everything and never leak to user space, except in core
    dumps.  The user struct pt_regs is always at the base of the thread's
    kernel stack and so it seems unlikely the information that leaks from
    here is ever worthwhile so as to be a security concern, but I'm not
    sure about that.  It has been this way for ages; userland consumers of
    core dumps all mask off these high bits themselves.  So it is not urgent.
    
    This change masks off the padding bits of the segment register slots
    in core dumps.  ptrace already masks off these high bits, so this
    makes the values in core dumps consistent with what ptrace would
    report just before the process died.
    
    As I read the processor manuals, the cs and ss values will always be
    padded with zero bits rather than stack garbage.  But unlike "pushl %es",
    this is not simple to test with a userland program.  So I added the two
    instructions rather than wonder if they are really never necessary.
    
    I think that x86_64 does not have this problem (for either 32-bit or
    64-bit processes).  It only uses "mov" instructions from segment
    registers, which zero-extend.

    The code boundaries are 3233480704 to 3233523592, which are:

    	$1 = 0xc0bb0000
    	(gdb) p/x 3233523592
    	$2 = 0xc0bba788
    
    Which corresponds to this line in the maps file:
    
    	c0bb0000-c0bba788 r-xs 00000000 00:0b 14582157  /lib/ld-uClibc-0.9.28.so
    
    Which is wrong.  After the patch is applied, the maps file is pretty much
    identical (there's some minor shuffling of the location of some of the

    	# cat /proc/610/stat
    	610 (inetd) S 1 610 610 0 -1 256 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 18 0 1 0 94392000722

    The code boundaries are then 3276111872 to 3276141668, which are:
    
    	(gdb) p/x 3276111872
    	$1 = 0xc3458000
    	(gdb) p/x 3276141668
    	$2 = 0xc345f464
    
    And these correspond to this line in the maps file instead:
    
    	c3458000-c345f464 r-xs 00000000 00:0b 16384612  /usr/sbin/inetd
    
    Which is now correct.

    [PATCH] i386: add command line option "local_apic_timer_c2_ok"
    
    It turned out that it is almost impossible to trust ACPI, BIOS & Co.
    regarding the C states. This was the reason to switch the local apic
    timer off in C2 state already. OTOH there are sane and well behaving
    systems, which get punished by that decision.
    
    Allow the user to confirm that the local apic timer is trustworthy in C2
    state. This keeps the default behaviour on the safe side.

    [PATCH] setup_boot_APIC_clock() irq-enable fix
    
    latest -git triggers an irqtrace/lockdep warning of a leaked
    irqs-off condition:
    
      BUG: at kernel/fork.c:1033 copy_process()
    
    after some debugging it turns out that commit ca1b940c accidentally left
    interrupts disabled - which trickled down all the way to the first time
    we fork a kernel thread and triggered the warning.
    
    the fix is to re-enable interrupts in the 'else' branch of
    setup_boot_APIC_clock()'s pmtimers calibration path.

    [PATCH] lockdep: debug_show_all_locks & debug_show_held_locks vs. debug_locks
    
    lockdep's data shouldn't be used when debug_locks == 0 because it's not
    updated after this, so it's more misleading than helpful.
    
    PS: probably lockdep's current-> fields should be reset after it turns
    debug_locks off: so, after printing a bug report, but before return from
    exported functions, but there are really a lot of these possibilities (e.g.
     after DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON), so, something could be missed.  (Of course
    direct use of this fields isn't recommended either.)

    [PATCH] i386: disable local apic timer via command line or dmi quirk
    
    The local APIC timer stops to work in deeper C-States.  This is handled by
    the ACPI code and a broadcast mechanism in the clockevents / tick managment
    code.
    
    Some systems do not expose the deeper C-States to the kernel, but switch
    into deeper C-States behind the kernels back.  This delays the local apic
    timer interrupts for ever and makes the systems unusable.
    
    Add a command line option to disable the local apic timer and a dmi
    quirk for known broken systems.
    
    Andi sayeth:
    
      While not wrong by itself i think it is still better to use some heuristic
      -- like "has battery in ACPI" With the DMI table if the problem is more wide
      spread we will just continue extending it.
    
      But anyways should be ok now for .21 although I'm not really happy with
      it.

    [PATCH] i386: clockevents fix breakage on Geode/Cyrix PIT implementations
    
    The PIT has no dedicated mode for shut down. The only way to disable PIT
    is to put it into one shot mode. AMD implementations of PIT on Geode
    (also observed on Cyrix) are confused by an "empty" transition from
    CLOCK_EVT_MODE_UNUSED to CLOCK_EVT_MODE_SHUTDOWN, which puts the PIT
    into one shot mode momentarily.
    
    I realized after staring helpless at the bug report
    http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8027 for quite a while, that
    the only change, which might influence the bogomips calibration, is the
    above transition during the PIT initialization.
    
    Avoiding the unnecessary switch to oneshot and later to periodic mode
    fixes the weird bogomips value and also the resulting slowness.
    
    The fix is confirmed on OLPC and another Geode based box.
    
    Note: this is unrelated to the Dual Core problem discussed here:

    [CIFS] Allow reset of file to ATTR_NORMAL when archive bit not set
    
    When a file had a dos attribute of 0x1 (readonly - but dos attribute
    of archive was not set) - doing chmod 0777 or equivalent would
    try to set a dos attribute of 0 (which some servers ignore)
    rather than ATTR_NORMAL (0x20) which most servers accept.
    Does not affect servers which support the CIFS Unix Extensions.

    IB/ipoib: Fix thinko in packet length checks
    
    The packet length checks in ipoib are broken: we add 4 bytes (IPoIB
    encapsulation header) when sending a packet, not 20 bytes (hardware
    address length) to each packet.  Therefore, if connected mode is
    enabled so that the interface MTU is larger than the multicast MTU,
    IPoIB may end up trying to send too-long multicast packets.  For
    example, multicast is broken if a message of size 2048 bytes is sent
    on an interface with UD MTU 2048, because 2048 is bigger than the real
    limit of 2044 but the code tests against the wrong limit of 2060.

    IPoIB: Fix use-after-free in path_rec_completion()
    
    The connected mode code added the possibility that an neigh struct
    gets freed in the list_for_each_entry() loop in path_rec_completion(),
    which causes a use-after-free.  Fix this by changing to the _safe
    variant of the list walking macro.

    IPoIB: Fix race in detaching from mcast group before attaching
    
    There's a race between ipoib_mcast_leave() and ipoib_mcast_join_finish()
    where we can try to detach from a multicast group before we've
    attached to it.  Fix this by reordering the code in ipoib_mcast_leave
    to free the multicast group first, which waits for the multicast
    callback thread (which calls ipoib_mcast_join_finish()) to complete
    before detaching from the group.

    [NETFILTER]: nat: avoid rerouting packets if only XFRM policy key changed
    
    Currently NAT not only reroutes packets in the OUTPUT chain when the
    routing key changed, but also if only the non-routing part of the
    IPsec policy key changed. This breaks ping -I since it doesn't use
    SO_BINDTODEVICE but IP_PKTINFO cmsg to specify the output device, and
    this information is lost.
    
    Only do full rerouting if the routing key changed, and just do a new
    policy lookup with the old route if only the ports changed.

    [POWERPC] Avoid hypervisor statistics calculation in real mode
    
    kexec invokes plpar_hcall hypervisor call in real mode.  plpar_hcall
    refers to per cpu variables for accounting hypervisor statistics.
    These variables may not be in the RMO region, so accesses to them
    in real mode may result in a data storage exception.
    
    This fixes this problem by using a new plpar_hcall_raw function which
    does not update the hypervisor call statistics.  Thanks to Anton for

    [CRYPTO] doc: Fix typo in hash example
    
    there is a tiny bug in Documentation/crypto/api-intro.txt.
    The file has the following example code:
    
    struct scatterlist sg[2];
    [...]
    if (crypto_hash_digest(&desc, &sg, 2, result))
    
    which does not match the declaration of crypto_hash_digest() in

    (static inline int crypto_hash_digest(struct hash_desc *desc,
    	struct scatterlist *sg, unsigned int nbytes, u8 *out)
    
    The code in the example passes the address of a pointer (an array actually) as
    the second argument, while the function expects the pointer itself.

    [CRYPTO] api: scatterwalk_copychunks() fails to advance through scatterlist
    
    In the loop in scatterwalk_copychunks(), if walk->offset is zero,
    then scatterwalk_pagedone rounds that up to the nearest page boundary:
    
    		walk->offset += PAGE_SIZE - 1;
    		walk->offset &= PAGE_MASK;
    
    which is a no-op in this case, so we don't advance to the next element
    of the scatterlist array:
    
    		if (walk->offset >= walk->sg->offset + walk->sg->length)
    			scatterwalk_start(walk, sg_next(walk->sg));
    
    and we end up copying the same data twice.
    
    It appears that other callers of scatterwalk_{page}done first advance
    walk->offset, so I believe that's the correct thing to do here.
    
    This caused a bug in NFS when run with krb5p security, which would
    cause some writes to fail with permissions errors--for example, writes
    of less than 8 bytes (the des blocksize) at the start of a file.

    5c64097aa0f6dc4f27718ef47ca9a12538d62860, first in 2.6.19-rc1.

    If the slab contains sufficient memory, then kmalloc() works

    [IA64] min_low_pfn and max_low_pfn calculation fix
    
    We have seen bad_pte_print when testing crashdump on an SN machine in
    recent 2.6.20 kernel.  There are tons of bad pte print (pfn < max_low_pfn)
    reports when the crash kernel boots up, all those reported bad pages
    are inside initmem range; That is because if the crash kernel code and
    data happens to be at the beginning of the 1st node. build_node_maps in
    discontig.c will bypass reserved regions with filter_rsvd_memory. Since
    min_low_pfn is calculated in build_node_map, so in this case, min_low_pfn
    will be greater than kernel code and data.
    
    Because pages inside initmem are freed and reused later, we saw
    pfn_valid check fail on those pages.
    
    I think this theoretically happen on a normal kernel. When I check
    min_low_pfn and max_low_pfn calculation in contig.c and discontig.c.
    I found more issues than this.
    
    1. min_low_pfn and max_low_pfn calculation is inconsistent between
    contig.c and discontig.c,
    min_low_pfn is calculated as the first page number of boot memmap in
    contig.c (Why? Though this may work at the most of the time, I don't
    think it is the right logic). It is calculated as the lowest physical
    memory page number bypass reserved regions in discontig.c.
    max_low_pfn is calculated include reserved regions in contig.c. It is
    calculated exclude reserved regions in discontig.c.
    
    2. If kernel code and data region is happen to be at the begin or the
    end of physical memory, when min_low_pfn and max_low_pfn calculation is
    bypassed kernel code and data, pages in initmem will report bad.
    
    3. initrd is also in reserved regions, if it is at the begin or at the
    end of physical memory, kernel will refuse to reuse the memory. Because
    the virt_addr_valid check in free_initrd_mem.
    
    So it is better to fix and clean up those issues.
    Calculate min_low_pfn and max_low_pfn in a consistent way.

    [SCTP]: Reset some transport and association variables on restart
    
    If the association has been restarted, we need to reset the
    transport congestion variables as well as accumulated error
    counts and CACC variables.  If we do not, the association
    will use the wrong values and may terminate prematurely.
    
    This was found with a scenario where the peer restarted
    the association when lksctp was in the last HB timeout for
    its association.  The restart happened, but the error counts
    have not been reset and when the timeout occurred, a newly
    restarted association was terminated due to excessive
    retransmits.

    ACPI: IA64: fix %ll build warnings
    
    acpi_integer is 64-bits on all platforms, and so was defined as a u64.
    
    i386 and x86_64 define u64 as unsigned long long.
    ia64 defines u64 as long.
    
    While these are all 64-bits, the kernel build warns about formating
    a "long" with %ll:
    
    drivers/ata/libata-acpi.c:176: warning: long long unsigned int format, acpi_integer arg (arg 5)

    ACPI: IA64: fix allnoconfig build
    
    The evils of Kconfig's select bite us once again...
    ia64/Kconfig selects ACPI, which depends on PM.
    But select ignores dependencies, allnoconfig
    chooses CONFIG_PM=n, and thus the menu of sub-options
    under ACPI vanish, which breaks the build.
    
    Manually select PM along with ACPI for now.
    Some day, we should delete them both, or fix select.

    It looks like a mini PCI-Express adapter.  The mPCIE connector includes USB
    pins... the card shows up to the system as a USB device, and powers itself
    from the PCI bus.
    
    The card I have isn't activated yet, so I can't get a PPP session up yet, but
    I have tested basic serial communication successfully in both 2.6.18 and
    2.6.20 kernels, once the product ID was added.  (the driver changed quite a
    bit between the two revs.)  In both drivers, it responds to AT commands and
    such.

    USB: necessary update for mos7720 driver
    
    these devices have a shared interrupt endpoint. For serialcore to pass
    an interrupt endpoint to a subdriver, the subdriver must define and
    _export_ a fitting callback. The mos7720 driver failed to do so. This led
    invariably to an oops upon open. This patch fixes it. The driver is useless
    without it. Please try to get this into 2.6.21 and the stable kernels that
    have this driver.

    [PATCH] tty: Fix two reported pid leaks
    
    These leaks were reported by: Catalin Marinas <catalin.marians@gmail.com>
    and I have been able to very by inspection they are possible.
    
    When converting tty_io.c to store pids as struct pid pointers instead
    of pid_t values it appears I overlooked two places where we stop using
    the pid value.  The very obvious one is in do_tty_hangup, and the one
    the less obvious one in __proc_set_tty.
    
    When looking into the code __proc_set_tty only has pids that need to
    be put because of failures of other parts of the code to properly
    perform hangup processing.   Fixing the leak here in __proc_set_tty
    is easy and obviously correct so I am doing that first.
    
    Fixing the places that should be performing hangup processing is much
    less obviously correct.  So those I'm aiming those patches at -mm.
    for now, so the can age a while before they are merged.

    [PATCH] i386: trust the PM-Timer calibration of the local APIC timer
    
    When PM-Timer is available for local APIC timer calibration we can skip the
    verification of the calibrated time value.  The resulting error is quite
    small on a bunch of evaluated platforms and is less harming than the
    observed false positives.
    
    We need to keep the verification on systems, which have no PM-Timer to
    avoid bogus local APIC timer calibrations in the range of factor 2-10,
    which can be observed when swicthing off the PM-timer support in the kernel
    configuration.
    
    The wrong calibration values are probably caused by SMM code trying to
    emulate a PS/2 keyboard from a (maybe connected or not) USB keyboard.  This
    prohibits the accurate delivery of PIT interrupts, which are used to
    calibrate the local APIC timer.  Unfortunately we have no way to disable
    this BIOS misfeature in the early boot process.
    
    Add also the dropped cpu_relax() back to the wait loops.

    KVM: MMU: Fix host memory corruption on i386 with >= 4GB ram
    
    PAGE_MASK is an unsigned long, so using it to mask physical addresses on
    i386 (which are 64-bit wide) leads to truncation.  This can result in
    page->private of unrelated memory pages being modified, with disasterous
    results.
    
    Fix by not using PAGE_MASK for physical addresses; instead calculate
    the correct value directly from PAGE_SIZE.  Also fix a similar BUG_ON().

    KVM: MMU: Fix guest writes to nonpae pde
    
    KVM shadow page tables are always in pae mode, regardless of the guest
    setting.  This means that a guest pde (mapping 4MB of memory) is mapped
    to two shadow pdes (mapping 2MB each).
    
    When the guest writes to a pte or pde, we intercept the write and emulate it.
    We also remove any shadowed mappings corresponding to the write.  Since the
    mmu did not account for the doubling in the number of pdes, it removed the
    wrong entry, resulting in a mismatch between shadow page tables and guest
    page tables, followed shortly by guest memory corruption.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by detecting the special case of writing to
    a non-pae pde and adjusting the address and number of shadow pdes zapped
    accordingly.

    ide: remove CONFIG_IDEDMA_{ICS,PCI}_AUTO config options
    
    All modern distributions have been setting these options to "y" for ages.
    (additionally "n" cases have been obsoleted for few years).  Therefore use
    DMA by default and remove CONFIG_IDEDMA_{ICS,PCI}_AUTO (also remove no longer
    needed CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO).  This fixes DMA support for rare configurations
    where CONFIG_IDEDMA_{ICS,PCI}_AUTO was set to "n" but "hdparm -d 1" was used
    to enable DMA support and which were forced to PIO mode by "ide: don't allow
    DMA to be enabled if CONFIG_IDEDMA_{ICS,PCI}_AUTO=n" patch.  There is no
    functionality loss because "ide=nodma" kernel option is still available.

    ide: don't allow DMA to be enabled if CONFIG_IDEDMA_{ICS,PCI}_AUTO=n
    
    For CONFIG_IDEDMA_{ICS,PCI}_AUTO=n and/or "ide=nodma" option the host/device
    are not programmed for DMA and it is also explicitly disabled by ide_set_dma()
    (->ide_dma_check returns "-1").  However the code responsible for manually
    enabling DMA ("hdparm -d 1") has a bug which results in DMA being erroneously
    enabled - ide_set_dma() incorrectly passes "0" return value to set_using_dma().
    This may work if BIOS/firmware configured the host/device for DMA and chipset
    allows independent configuration of DMA/PIO modes but won't work after suspend
    and is generally unsafe on many chipsets (possibly including data corruption
    if the same registers are used for DMA/PIO timings).
    
    This patch fixes kernel bugzilla bug #8169 (piix host driver fixes for
    setting PIO mode exposed the problem described above).  The side-effect of
    the fix is that some rare configuration may be forced to PIO mode when DMA
    mode was previously used - this is addressed by the next patch which removes
    CONFIG_IDEDMA_{PCI,ICS}_AUTO config option completely.
    
    Thanks goes out to Patrick Horn for reporting the issue, narrowing it down
    to the specific commit and testing the fix.  Also thanks to Sergei Shtylyov
    for help in debugging the problem.

    jmicron: make ide jmicron driver play nice with libata ones
    
    When libata is configured, the device is configured such that SATA and
    PATA ports live in separate functions with different programming
    interfaces.  pata_jmicron and ide jmicron drivers can drive only the
    PATA part.
    
    This patch makes jmicron match PCI class code such that it doesn't

    attaching.

    cmd64x: fix recovery time calculation (take 3)
    
    The driver wrongly takes the address setup time into account when calculating
    the PIO recovery time -- this leads to slight overclocking of the PIO modes 0
    and 1 (so, the prayers failed to help, as usual :-).  Rework the code to be
    calculating recovery clock count as a difference between the total cycle count
    and the active count (we don't need to calculate the recovery time itself since
    it's not specified for the PIO modes 0 to 2, and for modes 3 and 4 this formula
    gives enough recovery time anyway in the chip's supported PCI frequency range).
    
    This patch has been inspired by reading the datasheets and looking at what the
    libata driver does; it has been compile-tested only (as usual :-) but anyway,
    the new code gives the same or longer recovery times than the old one...

    ACPI: Only use IPI on known broken machines (AMD, Dothan/BaniasPentium M)
    
    Use IPI for blacklisted CPUs, add parameter IPI vs LAPIC
    
    Currently, Linux disables lapic timer for all machines with C2 and higher

    According to Intel only specific Intel models (Banias/Dothan) are broken

    However, I am not sure about the naming of the parameter and how it
    could/should get integrated into the dyntick part
    (CONFIG_GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS). There, a more fine grained check (TSC
    still running?, ..) is needed? Does this make sense (always use

    [PATCH] clockevents: Fix suspend/resume to disk hangs
    
    I finally found a dual core box, which survives suspend/resume without
    crashing in the middle of nowhere. Sigh, I never figured out from the
    code and the bug reports what's going on.
    
    The observed hangs are caused by a stale state transition of the clock
    event devices, which keeps the RCU synchronization away from completion,
    when the non boot CPU is brought back up.
    
    The suspend/resume in oneshot mode needs the similar care as the
    periodic mode during suspend to RAM. My assumption that the state
    transitions during the different shutdown/bringups of s2disk would go
    through the periodic boot phase and then switch over to highres resp.
    nohz mode were simply wrong.
    
    Add the appropriate suspend / resume handling for the non periodic
    modes.

    [PATCH] spi_s3c24xx.c: warning fix
    
    The set_cs field of struct s3c24xx_spi is declared as returning a int but
    the value returned but set_cs is never fixed.  Moreover, the default
    function for set_cs and the set_cs defintion in the platform data are
    returning void.
    
    I'm proposing to change the prototype to void (*set_cs)(...). By doing
    this, I'm also fixing 2 build warnings:
    
      drivers/spi/spi_s3c24xx.c: In function 's3c24xx_spi_probe':

    [PATCH] fix process crash caused by randomisation and 64k pages
    
    This bug was seen on ppc64, but it could have occurred on any
    architecture with a page size of 64k or above.  The problem is that in
    fs/binfmt_elf.c:randomize_stack_top() randomizes the stack to within
    0x7ff pages.  On 4k page machines, this is 8MB; on 64k page boxes, this
    is 128MB.
    
    The problem is that the new binary layout (selected in
    arch_pick_mmap_layout) places the mapping segment 128MB or the stack
    rlimit away from the top of the process memory, whichever is larger.  If
    you chose an rlimit of less than 128MB (most defaults are in the 8Mb
    range) then you can end up having your entire stack randomized away.
    
    The fix is to make randomize_stack_top() only steal at most 8MB, which this
    patch does.  However, I have to point out that even with this, your stack
    rlimit might not be exactly what you get if it's > 128MB, because you're
    still losing the random offset of up to 8MB.
    
    The true fix should be to leave an explicit gap for the randomization plus
    a buffer when determining mmap_base, but that would involve fixing all the
    architectures.

    Looks like we need a check in nfs_getattr() for a regular file. It makes

    should fix your problem: it will stop the NFS client from interfering

    [PATCH] nfs: fix congestion control
    
    The current NFS client congestion logic is severly broken, it marks the
    backing device congested during each nfs_writepages() call but doesn't
    mirror this in nfs_writepage() which makes for deadlocks.  Also it
    implements its own waitqueue.
    
    Replace this by a more regular congestion implementation that puts a cap on
    the number of active writeback pages and uses the bdi congestion waitqueue.
    
    Also always use an interruptible wait since it makes sense to be able to
    SIGKILL the process even for mounts without 'intr'.

    The only error code which comes from the partition checkers is -1, when

    So, with the current code, we end up returning -1 and not EIO for the

    Check for this condition and set the expiry value to the max.  expiry time
    in the future.  The fix should be applied to stable kernel series as well.

    This is a hack that seems to kick start the 2D engine of the Savage IX in some

    occasionally crashes X.

    [PATCH] gpio_direction_output() needs an initial value
    
    It's been pointed out that output GPIOs should have an initial value, to
    avoid signal glitching ...  among other things, it can be some time before
    a driver is ready.  This patch corrects that oversight, fixing
    
     - documentation
     - platforms supporting the GPIO interface
     - users of that call (just one for now, others are pending)
    
    There's only one user of this call for now since most platforms are still
    using non-generic GPIO setup code, which in most cases already couples the
    initial value with its "set output mode" request.
    
    Note that most platforms are clear about the hardware letting the output
    value be set before the pin direction is changed, but the s3c241x docs are
    vague on that topic ...  so those chips might not avoid the glitches.

    [PATCH] spi: destroy workqueue after spi_unregister_master
    
    Fix a bug in the cleanup of an spi_bitbang bus.
    
    The workqueue associated with the bus was destroyed before the call to
    spi_unregister_master.  That meant that spi devices on that bus would be
    unable to do IO in their remove method.  The shutdown flag should have been
    able to prevent a segfault, but was never getting set.  By waiting to
    destroy the workqueue until after the master is unregistered, devices are
    able to do IO in their remove methods.  An added benefit is that neither
    the shutdown flag nor a wait for the queue of messages to empty is needed.

    [PATCH] dio: invalidate clean pages before dio write
    
    This patch fixes a user-triggerable oops that was reported by Leonid
    Ananiev as archived at http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/8/337.
    
    dio writes invalidate clean pages that intersect the written region so that
    subsequent buffered reads go to disk to read the new data.  If this fails
    the interface tries to tell the caller that the cache is inconsistent by
    returning EIO.
    
    Before this patch we had the problem where this invalidation failure would
    clobber -EIOCBQUEUED as it made its way from fs/direct-io.c to fs/aio.c.
    Both fs/aio.c and bio completion call aio_complete() and we reference freed
    memory, usually oopsing.
    
    This patch addresses this problem by invalidating before the write so that
    we can cleanly return -EIO before ->direct_IO() has had a chance to return
    -EIOCBQUEUED.
    
    There is a compromise here.  During the dio write we can fault in mmap()ed
    pages which intersect the written range with get_user_pages() if the user
    provided them for the source buffer.  This is a crazy thing to do, but we
    can make it mostly work in most cases by trying the invalidation again.
    The compromise is that we won't return an error if this second invalidation
    fails if it's an AIO write and we have -EIOCBQUEUED.
    
    This was tested by having two processes race performing large O_DIRECT and
    buffered ordered writes.  Within minutes ext3 would see a race between
    ext3_releasepage() and jbd holding a reference on ordered data buffers and
    would cause invalidation to fail, panicing the box.  The test can be found
    in the 'aio_dio_bugs' test group in test.kernel.org/autotest.  After this
    patch the test passes.

    [PATCH] ufs: zeroize the rest of block in truncate
    
    This patch fix behaviour in such test scenario:
    
      lseek(fd, BIG_OFFSET)
      write(fd, buf, sizeof(buf))
      truncate(BIG_OFFSET)
      truncate(BIG_OFFSET + sizeof(buf))
      read(fd, buf...)
    
    Because of if file big enough(BIG_OFFSET) we start allocate space by block,
    ordinary block size > page size, so we should zeroize the rest of block in
    truncate(except last framgnet, about which VFS should care), to not get
    garbage, when we extend file.
    
    Also patch corrects conversion from pointer to block to physical block number,
    this helps in case of not common used UFS types.
    
    And add to debug output inode number.

    [PATCH] ufs2: more correct work with time
    
    This patch corrects work with time in UFS2 case.
    
    1) According to UFS2 disk layout modification/access and so on "time"
       should be hold in two variables one 64bit for seconds and another 32bit for
       nanoseconds,
    
       at now for some unknown reason we suppose that "inode time" holds in
       three variables 32bit for seconds, 32bit for milliseconds and 32bit for
       nanoseconds.
    
    2) We set amount of nanoseconds in "VFS inode" to 0 during read, instead of
       getting values from "on disk inode"(this should close
       http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7991).

    (pathological) case:
    
      % dd bs=1 seek=840716287 if=/dev/zero of=d1 count=1
      % for i in 2 3 4; do dd if=/dev/zero of=d$i bs=1k count=$(($i+150)); done
      % ./vmlinux ubd0=root ubd1=d1 ubd2=d2 ubd3=d3 ubd4=d4
      # mdadm -C /dev/md0 --level=linear --raid-devices=4 /dev/ubd[1234]
    
    adding some printks, I saw this:

    [SPARC64]: Get DEBUG_PAGEALLOC working again.
    
    We have to make sure to use base-pagesize TLB entries even during the
    early transition period where we need TLB miss handling but don't have
    the kernel page tables setup yet for the linear region.
    
    Also, it is necessary therefore to not use the 4MB TSB for these
    translations, and instead use the normal kernel TSB.  This allows us
    to also get rid of the 4MB tsb for debug builds which shrinks the
    kernel a little bit.

    [IPV6]: ipv6_fl_socklist is inadvertently shared.
    
    The ipv6_fl_socklist from listening socket is inadvertently shared
    with new socket created for connection.  This leads to a variety of
    interesting, but fatal, bugs. For example, removing one of the
    sockets may lead to the other socket's encountering a page fault
    when the now freed list is referenced.
    
    The fix is to not share the flow label list with the new socket.

    Hello, Just discussed this Patrick...
    
    We have two users of trie_leaf_remove, fn_trie_flush and fn_trie_delete
    both are holding RTNL. So there shouldn't be need for this preempt stuff.
    This is assumed to a leftover from an older RCU-take.

    The warnings does not show up during a normal build due to kbuild
    failing to check for section mismatch in vmlinux.
    To see these warnings run:
    scripts/mod/modpost arch/x86_64/kernel/built-in.o
    
    kbuild will be fixed but the 'noise-level' had to be decresed first.
    There remains a few section mismatch warnigns for x86_64 for areas where I did
    not feel confident.

    [PATCH] bcm43xx: MANUALWLAN fixes
    
    During testing of bcm43xx interference mitigation, two problems were
    discovered:
    
    (1) When the MANUALWLAN mode was set, routines _stack_save and _stack_restore
        generated assertions that were traced to saving ILT registers with addresses
        > 0xFFF. This problem was fixed by adding one bit to the field used for
        the offset, and subtracting one bit from the space used for the id.
    (2) In MANUALWLAN mode, the IRQ XMIT errors are generated. The cause of these
        errors has not yet been located. Any suggestions on debugging this problem
        would be greatly appreciated.

    [PATCH] sysfs: reinstate exclusion between method calls and attribute unregistration
    
    This patch (as869) reinstates the mutual exclusion between sysfs
    attribute method calls and attribute unregistration.  The
    previously-reported deadlocks have been fixed, and this exclusion is
    by far the simplest way to avoid races during driver unbinding.
    
    The check for orphaned read-buffers has been moved down slightly, so
    that the remainder of a partially-read buffer will still be available
    to userspace even after the attribute has been unregistered.

    [PATCH] sysfs and driver core: add callback helper, used by SCSI and S390
    
    This patch (as868) adds a helper routine for device drivers that need
    to set up a callback to perform some action in a different process's
    context.  This is intended for use by attribute methods that want to
    unregister themselves or their parent device.  Attribute method calls

    [ARM] 4264/1: ldrex/strex syntax errors with recent compilers
    
    Trying to build some code using atomic_clear_mask() on a ARM v6
    processor with a recent compiler (tried with gcc version 4.1.1
    (CodeSourcery ARM Sourcery G++ 2006q3-26), but
    all gcc > 4.1 might be affected) results in the following:
    
    /tmp/ccWKLJV8.s: Assembler messages:
    /tmp/ccWKLJV8.s:581: Error: instruction does not accept this addressing
    mode -- `ldrex r0,r3'
    /tmp/ccWKLJV8.s:583: Error: instruction does not accept this addressing
    mode -- `strex r1,r0,r3'
    
    Older gcc (like gcc version 4.0.0 (DENX ELDK 4.1 4.0.0)) have no problem
    with this.
    
    The patch below fixes the compile error. I also verified that gcc-4.0.0 generates identical code using both forms.

    natsemi: Avoid IntrStatus lossage if RX state machine resets.
    
    This patch fixes the poll routine for the natsemi driver so that if the
    driver detects an RX state machine lockup then no interrupts will be
    lost while the driver recovers from that.

    natsemi: Fix NAPI for interrupt sharing
    
    The interrupt status register for the natsemi chips is clear on read and
    was read unconditionally from both the interrupt and from the NAPI poll
    routine, meaning that if the interrupt service routine was called (for
    example, due to a shared interrupt) while a NAPI poll was scheduled
    interrupts could be missed.  This patch fixes that by ensuring that the
    interrupt status register is only read by the interrupt handler when
    interrupts are enabled from the chip.
    
    It also reverts a workaround for this problem from the netpoll hook and
    improves the trace for interrupt events.

    natsemi: Consistently use interrupt enable/disable functions
    
    The natsemi drivers include functions for enabling and disabling
    interrupts from the chip but these are not used in all code paths.  This
    patch changes the code paths that touch the interrupt enable register to
    use the functions.  In all cases this adds an extra PCI read to post the
    operation but since none of these are in fast paths this shouldn't be
    too much of a problem.

    skge: set mac address bonding fix
    
    When bonding does fail over it calls set_mac_address.  When this happens
    as the result of another port going down, the phy_mutex that is common to
    both ports is held, so it deadlocks. Setting the address doesn't need to do
    anything that needs the phy_mutex, it already has the RTNL to protect against
    other admin actions.
    
    This change just disables the receiver to avoid any hardware confusion
    while address is changing.

    Under load, OCFS2 would crash in invalidate_inode_pages2_range() because
    invalidate_complete_page2() was unable to invalidate a page.  It would
    appear that JBD is holding on to the page.  ext3 has a specific
    ->releasepage() handler to cover this case.

    on some devices that have the audio codec at bit#3.
    Now max codecs is defined according to the driver type, either 3 or 4.

    [XFRM]: Fix missing protocol comparison of larval SAs.
    
    I noticed that in xfrm_state_add we look for the larval SA in a few
    places without checking for protocol match. So when using both
    AH and ESP, whichever one gets added first, deletes the larval SA.
    It seems AH always gets added first and ESP is always the larval
    SA's protocol since the xfrm->tmpl has it first. Thus causing the
    additional km_query()
    
    Adding the check eliminates accidental double SA creation.

    [PATCH] Fix VMI and COMPAT_VDSO for 2.6.21
    
    VMI is broken under COMPAT_VDSO, as Xen and other non hardware assisted
    hypervisors will be.  I have been working on a fix for this which works
    for older glibcs that panic when the new relocatable VDSO is used.
    
    However, I believe at this time that the fix is going to be too radical
    to consider at this stage in the release of 2.6.21.  We don't expect
    this config option to be turned on by vendors for new distributions, so
    at this point we are willing to drop support for it when VMI is compiled
    in, and work on a patch for 2.6.22 which more fully addresses the
    problem.

    [PATCH] pci: Repair pci_save/restore_state so we can restore one save many times.
    
    Because we do not reserve space for the pci-x and pci-e state in struct
    pci dev we need to dynamically allocate it.  However because we need
    to support restore being called multiple times after a single save
    it is never safe to free the buffers we have allocated to hold the
    state.
    
    So this patch modifies the save routines to first check to see
    if we have already allocated a state buffer before allocating
    a new one.  Then the restore routines are modified to not free
    the state after restoring it.  Simple and it fixes some subtle
    error path handling bugs, that are hard to test for.

    [PATCH] msi: Safer state caching.
    
    There are two ways pci_save_state and pci_restore_state are used.  As
    helper functions during suspend/resume, and as helper functions around
    a hardware reset event.  When used as helper functions around a hardware
    reset event there is no reason to believe the calls will be paired, nor
    is there a good reason to believe that if we restore the msi state from
    before the reset that it will match the current msi state.  Since arch
    code may change the msi message without going through the driver, drivers
    currently do not have enough information to even know when to call
    pci_save_state to ensure they will have msi state in sync with the other
    kernel irq reception data structures.
    
    It turns out the solution is straight forward, cache the state in the
    existing msi data structures (not the magic pci saved things) and
    have the msi code update the cached state each time we write to the hardware.
    This means we never need to read the hardware to figure out what the hardware
    state should be.
    
    By modifying the caching in this manner we get to remove our save_state
    routines and only need to provide restore_state routines.
    
    The only fields that were at all tricky to regenerate were the msi and msi-x
    control registers and the way we regenerate them currently is a bit dependent
    upon assumptions on how we use the allow msi registers to be configured and used
    making the code a little bit brittle.  If we ever change what cases we allow
    or how we configure the msi bits we can address the fragility then.

    ACPI: resolve HP nx6125 S3 immediate wakeup regression
    
    Moving disable GPEs from enter_sleep up into sleep_prepare fixed
    the disabled SCI on S4 on Acer laptops.
    
    However, it caused an immediate S3 resume on the HP nx6125.
    Apparently, on the HP, a GPE was getting re-enabled after
    the prepare, but before the enter.
    
    Close that window by restoring the GPE disable on enter.
    This is redundant in most cases, but closes this window,
    where S3 and S4 paths differ.

    HID: zeroing of bytes in output fields is bogus
    
    This patch removes bogus zeroing of unused bits in output reports,
    introduced in Simon's patch in commit d4ae650a.
    According to the specification, any sane device should not care
    about values of unused bits.
    
    What is worse, the zeroing is done in a way which is broken and
    might clear certain bits in output reports which are actually
    _used_ - a device that has multiple fields with one value of
    the size 1 bit each might serve as an example of why this is
    bogus - the second call of hid_output_report() would clear the
    first bit of report, which has already been set up previously.
    
    This patch will break LEDs on SpaceNavigator, because this device
    is broken and takes into account the bits which it shouldn't touch.
    The quirk for this particular device will be provided in a separate
    patch.

    HID: allocate hid_parser in a proper way
    
    hid_parser is non-trivially large structure, so it should be allocated
    using vmalloc() to avoid unsuccessful allocations when memory fragmentation
    is too high.
    This structue has a very short life, it's destroyed as soon as the report
    descriptor has been completely parsed.
    
    This should be considered a temporary solution, until the hid_parser is
    rewritten to consume less memory during report descriptor parsing.

    sh: Fix PCI BAR address-space wraparound.
    
    When a SH7751R system includes a card that has wide range space
    like a graphics card, the pci-pci bridge controller can't set the
    correct address range.
    
    For example, when *lower_limit is 0xfd000000 and bar_size is
    0x4000000, in the following code at arch/sh/drivers/pci/pci-auto.c,
    0x0 is set in bar_value.
    
    pciauto_setup_bars()
    {
    ...
                    bar_value = ((*lower_limit - 1) & ~(bar_size - 1)) + bar_size;
    ...
                    *lower_limit = bar_value + bar_size;
    }
    
    As a result, 0x4000000 is set in *lower_limit, but this value is wrong.
    
    The following patch avoids this problem by checking the range of the
    value and refusing to update the BAR if the calculated value ends up
    being bogus.

    [SCSI] gdth: fix oops in gdth_copy_cmd()
    
    Recent alterations to the gdth_fill_raw_cmd() path no longer set the
    sg_ranz field for zero transfer commands. However, this field is used
    lower down in the function to initialise ha->cmd_len to the size of
    the firmware packet.  If this uninitialised field contains a bogus
    value, ha->cmd_len can become much larger than the actual firmware
    packet and end up oopsing in gdth_copy_cmd() as it tries to copy this
    huge packet to the device (usually because it runs into an unallocated
    page).
    
    The fix is to initialise the sg_ranz field to zero at the start of
    gdth_fill_raw_cmd().

    [SCSI] mptsas: Fix oops for insmod during kexec
    
    This fix's an oops during driver load time.   mptsas_probe calls
    mpt_attach(over in mptbase.c).  Inside that call, we read some
    manufacturing config pages to setup some defaults.  While reading the
    config pages, the firmware doesn't complete the reply in time, and we
    have a timeout. The timeout results in hardreset handler being called.
    The hardreset handler calls all the fusion upper layer driver reset
    callback handlers.  The mptsas_ioc_reset function is the callback
    handler in mptsas.c.   So where I'm getting to, is mptsas_ioc_reset is
    getting called before scsi_host_alloc is called, and the pointer ioc->sh
    is NULL as well as the hostdata.

    [SCSI] lpfc: avoid double-free during PCI error failure
    
    If a PCI error is detected that cannot be recovered from, there
    will be a double call of lpfc_pci_remove_one(), with the second call
    resulting in a null-pointer dereference. The first call occurs in
    lpfc_io_error_detected(), and the second call during pci device
    remove. This patch eliminates the first call; its un-needed.

    ACPI: Add support to parse 2nd MADT
    
    When a BIOS bug presents multiple APIC/MADTs,
    Linux currently uses the 1st and ignores the 2nd.
    
    But some machines work better if we use the 2nd.
    
    http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7465
    
    Add a warning and boot parameter "acpi_apic_instance=2"
    to allow parsing the 2nd.
    
    No change to default behaviour in this patch.

    This reverts commit d2487cb4257dafb686f682285854fe7f02ca29d8.
    
    Russell King points out that it's obviously bogus, and I have to agree.
    Not only does "irq" not even exist in that scope, but we obviously need
    to free the irq that we actually requested, and that's IRQ_USB.

    [SPARC64]: Fix atomicity of TIF update in flush_thread()
    
    Fix atomicity of TIF update in flush_thread() for sparc64
    
    Fixes correctly the race by using *_ti_thread_flag.
    
    Race :
    
    parent process executing :
    sys_ptrace()
     (lock_kernel())
     (ptrace_get_task_struct(pid))
     arch_ptrace()
       ptrace_detach()
         ptrace_disable(child);
           clear_singlestep(child);
             clear_tsk_thread_flag(child, TIF_SINGLESTEP);
             (which clears the TIF_SINGLESTEP flag atomically from a different
              process)
     (put_task_struct(child))
     (unlock_kernel())
    
    And at the same time, in the child process :
    sys_execve()
     do_execve()
       search_binary_handler()
         load_elf_binary()
           flush_old_exec()
             flush_thread()

    ACPI: ec: fix race in status register access
    
    Delay the read of the EC status register until
    after the event that caused it occurs -- otherwise
    it is possible to read and act on stale status that was
    associated with the previous event.
    
    Do this with a perpetually incrementing "event_count" to detect
    when a new event occurs and it is safe to read status.
    
    There is no workaround for polling mode -- it is inherently
    exposed to reading and acting on stale status, since it
    doesn't have an interrupt to tell it the event completed.

    Here is a patch adding the PID for the FT232RL to ftdi_sio. The patch
    generates a warning during compilation because get_ftdi_divisor doesn't
    explicitly handle the FT232RL with this patch, so I guess you don't want
    to use it in its current state. It is all I could come up with with the
    knowledge I have of the drivers at the moment, though, and I hope you
    can have some use for it at least. It works fine with my DLP-TILT with
    an FT232RL.

    USB: RTS/DTR signal patch for airprime driver
    
    I encountered some problems with the airprime driver in use with a Novatel
    Merlin XU870:
    
    Closing an open Connection to e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0 doesn't reset the
    RTS/DTR lines of the Modem.  Consequently, when I use minicom to
    establish a connection by "ATD*99#" the modem doesn't hang up even if i
    exit minicom and so I cannot reuse the modem unless I remove it and plug

    USB: add Additional PIDs in ftdi_sio
    
    I've developed some devices with FTDI chips (FT232xx). FTDI was so kind
    to give some own PID's which I can use together with their VID. Some of
    the devices are already very popular here and I have customers from
    universities, institutes .....
    
    I use the FTDI VID 0x0403. My PID's are:
    
    0xff38 - IBS US485 (USB<-->RS422/485 interface)
    0xff39 - IBS PIC-Programmer
    0xff3a - IBS Card reader for PCMCIA SRAM-cards
    0xff3b - IBS PK1 - Particel counter
    0xff3c - IBS RS232 - Monitor
    0xff3d - APP 70 (dust monitoring system)
    0xff3e - IBS PEDO-Modem (RF modem 868.35 MHz)
    0xff3f - future device
    
    The company is "IBS Ing.-Buero Schleusener".

    [POWERPC] Fix spu SLB invalidations
    
    The SPU code doesn't properly invalidate SPUs SLBs when necessary,
    for example when changing a segment size from the hugetlbfs code. In
    addition, it saves and restores the SLB content on context switches
    which makes it harder to properly handle those invalidations.
    
    This patch removes the saving & restoring for now, something more
    efficient might be found later on. It also adds a spu_flush_all_slbs(mm)
    that can be used by the core mm code to flush the SLBs of all SPEs that
    are running a given mm at the time of the flush.
    
    In order to do that, it adds a spinlock to the list of all SPEs and move
    some bits & pieces from spufs to spu_base.c

    [DCCP]: Initialise write_xmit_timer also on passive sockets
    
    The TX CCID needs the write_xmit_timer for delaying packet sends. Previously
    this timer was only activated on active (connecting) sockets.
    
    This patch initialises the write_xmit_timer in sync with the other timers, i.e.
    the timer will be ready on any socket. This is used by applications with a
    listening socket which start to stream after receiving an initiation by the
    client.  The write_xmit_timer is stopped when the application closes, as before.
    
    Was tested to work and to remove the timer bug reported on dccp@vger.
    
    Also moved timer initialisation into timer.c (static).

    cases. This is still being investigated. In addition, apparently the notifiers
    won't work if ADMA is disabled on the other port as a result of an ATAPI device
    being connected, and we don't handle this case properly.
    
    For now, just restore the previous behavior of checking all active commands
    to see if they are complete, without relying on the notifiers.

    Fix simplex adapters with libata
    
    Recently I got my hands on nVidia's MCP61 PM-AM board, and
    it contains IDE chip configured by BIOS with only primary
    channel enabled.  This confuses code which probes for
    device DMA capabilities - it gets 0x60 (happy duplex
    device) from primary channel BMDMA, but 0xFF (nobody here)
    from secondary channel BMDMA.  Due to this code then believes
    that chip is simplex.  I do not address this problem in
    my patch, as I'm not sure how to handle this.  Probably
    ata_pci_init_one should have bitmap of enabled/possible
    interfaces instead of their count, but it looks like
    quite intrusive change, and maybe we do not care - for device
    with only one channel simplex and regular DMA engines are
    same.
    
    But making device simplex pointed out that support for
    DMA on simplex devices is currently broken - ata_dev_xfermask
    tests whether device is simplex and if it is whether DMA
    engine was assigned to this port.  If not then it strips
    out DMA bits from device.  Problem is that code which assigns
    DMA engine to port in ata_set_mode first detect device
    mode and assigns DMA engine to channel only if some DMA
    capable device was found.
    
    And as xfermask stripped out DMA bits, host->simplex_claimed
    is always NULL with current implementation.
    
    By allowing DMA either if simplex_claimed is NULL or if it
    points to current port DMA can be finally used - it gets
    assigned to first port which contains any DMA capable
    device.

    [IA64] Cache error recovery
    
    Similar to memory error recovery, when a cache error is consumed
    by a user process terminate the user instead of crashing the system.

    [IA64] Proper handling of TLB errors from duplicate itr.d dropins
    
    Jack Steiner noticed that duplicate TLB DTC entries do not cause a
    linux panic.  See discussion:
    
    http://www.gelato.unsw.edu.au/archives/linux-ia64/0307/6108.html
    
    The current TLB recovery code is recovering from the duplicate itr.d
    dropins, masking the underlying problem.  This change modifies
    the MCA recovery code to look for the TLB check signature of the
    duplicate TLB entry and panic in that case.

    [PATCH] uml: arch_prctl should set thread fs
    
    In my previous x86_64 thread fix, I forgot to initialize thread.arch.fs in
    arch_prctl.  A process calling arch_prctl to set %fs would lose it on the
    next context switch.
    
    It also turns out that you can switch to a process which is in the process
    of exiting and which has lost its mm.  In this case, it's worse than
    useless to try to call arch_prctl on the host process.

    [PATCH] Add epoll compat_ code to fs/compat.c
    
    IA64 and ARM-OABI are currently using their own version of epoll compat_
    code.
    
    An architecture needs epoll_event translation if alignof(u64) in 32 bit
    mode is different from alignof(u64) in 64 bit mode.  If an architecture
    needs epoll_event translation, it must define struct compat_epoll_event in
    asm/compat.h and set CONFIG_HAVE_COMPAT_EPOLL_EVENT and use
    compat_sys_epoll_ctl and compat_sys_epoll_wait.
    
    All 64 bit architecture should use compat_sys_epoll_pwait.

    [PATCH] bluetooth: fix socket locking in hci_sock_dev_event()
    
    [Bluetooth] Fix socket locking in hci_sock_dev_event()
    
    hci_sock_dev_event() uses bh_lock_sock() to lock the socket lock.
    This is not deadlock-safe against locking of the same socket lock in
    l2cap_connect_cfm() from softirq context. In addition to that,
    hci_sock_dev_event() doesn't seem to be called from softirq context,
    so it is safe to use lock_sock()/release_sock() instead.
    
    The lockdep warning can be triggered on my T42p simply by switching
    the Bluetooth off by the keyboard button.

    [PATCH] x86_64: fix 2.6.18 regression - PTRACE_OLDSETOPTIONS should be accepted
    
    Also PTRACE_OLDSETOPTIONS should be accepted, as done by kernel/ptrace.c
    and forced by binary compatibility.  UML/32bit breaks because of this -
    since it is wise enough to use PTRACE_OLDSETOPTIONS to be binary compatible
    with 2.4 host kernels.
    
    Until 2.6.17 (commit f0f2d6536e3515b5b1b7ae97dc8f176860c8c2ce) we had:
    
           default:
                    return sys_ptrace(request, pid, addr, data);
    
    Instead here we have:
            case PTRACE_GET_THREAD_AREA:
    	case ...:
                    return sys_ptrace(request, pid, addr, data);
    
            default:
                    return -EINVAL;
    
    This change was a style change - when a case is added, it must be
    explicitly tested this way.  In this case, not enough testing was done.

    [PATCH] um: mark both consoles as CON_ANYTIME
    
    Since both UML consoles do not use percpu variables, they may be called when
    the cpu is still offline, and they may be marked CON_ANYTIME (this is
    documented in kernel/printk.c, grep for CON_ANYTIME to find mentions of this).
    
    Works well in testing done with lock debug enabled, should be safe but is not
    needed for next release.
    
    This would probably help also stderr_console.c, but this is yet to test.

    [JFFS2] Use yield() between GC passes in background thread.
    
    The garbage collection thread is strictly an optimisation. Everything it
    does would also be done just-in-time in the context of something in
    userspace trying to access the file system.
    
    Sometimes, however, it's a pessimisation. Especially during early boot
    when it's checksumming nodes and scanning inodes which are shortly going
    to be pulled in by read_inode anyway. We end up building the rbtree of
    node coverage twice for the same inode.
    
    By switching to yield() instead of cond_resched() in the main loop, we
    observe boot times on the OLPC system going down from about 100 seconds to
    60.

    [IPSEC]: xfrm_policy delete security check misplaced
    
    The security hooks to check permissions to remove an xfrm_policy were
    actually done after the policy was removed.  Since the unlinking and
    deletion are done in xfrm_policy_by* functions this moves the hooks
    inside those 2 functions.  There we have all the information needed to
    do the security check and it can be done before the deletion.  Since
    auditing requires the result of that security check err has to be passed
    back and forth from the xfrm_policy_by* functions.
    
    This patch also fixes a bug where a deletion that failed the security
    check could cause improper accounting on the xfrm_policy
    (xfrm_get_policy didn't have a put on the exit path for the hold taken
    by xfrm_policy_by*)
    
    It also fixes the return code when no policy is found in
    xfrm_add_pol_expire.  In old code (at least back in the 2.6.18 days) err
    wasn't used before the return when no policy is found and so the
    initialization would cause err to be ENOENT.  But since err has since
    been used above when we don't get a policy back from the xfrm_policy_by*
    function we would always return 0 instead of the intended ENOENT.  Also
    fixed some white space damage in the same area.

    [DCCP]: Revert patch which disables bidirectional mode
    
    This reverts an earlier patch which disabled bidirectional mode, meaning that
    a listening (passive) socket was not allowed to write to the other (active)
    end of the connection.
    
    This mode had been disabled when there were problems with CCID3, but it
    imposes a constraint on socket programming and thus hinders deployment.
    
    A change is included to ignore RX feedback received by the TX CCID3 module.
    
    Many thanks to Andre Noll for pointing out this issue.

    [NETFILTER]: nf_conntrack_ipv6: fix incorrect classification of IPv6 fragments as ESTABLISHED
    
    The individual fragments of a packet reassembled by conntrack have the
    conntrack reference from the reassembled packet attached, but nfctinfo
    is not copied. This leaves it initialized to 0, which unfortunately is
    the value of IP_CT_ESTABLISHED.
    
    The result is that all IPv6 fragments are tracked as ESTABLISHED,
    allowing them to bypass a usual ruleset which accepts ESTABLISHED

    [GFS2] fix hangup when multiple processes are trying to write to the same file
    
    This fixes a problem I encountered while running bonnie++.  When you have one
    thread that opens a file and starts to write to it, and then another thread that
    tries to open and write to the same file, the second thread will loop forever
    trying to grab the inode lock for that inode.  Basically we come in through
    generic_buffered_file_write, which calls gfs2_prepare_write, which then attempts
    to grab the glock.  Because we don't own the lock, gfs2_prepare_write gets
    GLR_TRYFAILED, which returns AOP_TRUNCATED_PAGE to generic_buffered_file_write.
    At this point generic_buffered_file_write loops around again and immediately
    retries the prepare_write.  This means that the second process never gets off of
    the processor in order to allow the process that holds the lock to finish its
    work and let go of the lock.  This patch makes gfs2_glock_nq schedule() if it
    gets back a GLR_TRYFAILED, which resolves this problem.

    check_tsc_sync_source() depends on being called with irqs disabled (it

    [AVR32] show_trace: Only walk valid stack addresses
    
    Terminate the frame pointer walk if (a) the address is outside the
    task's kernel stack or (b) if the frame pointer isn't monotonically
    increasing. Without this fix, show_trace() may enter an infinite
    loop, walking through random data anywhere in memory.
    
    Since any address within the kernel stack is guaranteed to be valid,
    we may eliminate the __get_user() calls as well.

    Revert "[PATCH] LOG2: Alter get_order() so that it can make use of ilog2() on a constant"
    
    This reverts commit 39d61db0edb34d60b83c5e0d62d0e906578cc707.
    
    The commit was buggy in multiple ways:
     - the conversion to ilog2() was incorrect to begin with
     - it tested the wrong #defines, so on all architectures but FRV you'd
       never see the bug except for constant arguments.
     - the new "get_order()" macro used its arguments multiple times, and
       didn't even parenthesize them properly
     - despite the comments, it was not true that you could use it for
       constant initializers, since not all architectures even use the
       generic page.h header file.
    
    All of the problems are individually fixable, but it all boils down to:
    better just revert it, and re-do it from scratch.

    [PATCH] Fix buffer overflow in Omnikey CardMan 4040 driver (CVE-2007-0005)
    
    Based on a patch from Don Howard <dhoward@redhat.com>
    
    When calling write() with a buffer larger than 512 bytes, the
    driver's write buffer overflows, allowing to overwrite the EIP and
    execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.
    
    In read(), there exists a similar problem, but coming from the device.
    A malicous or buggy device sending more than 512 bytes can overflow
    of the driver's read buffer, with the same effects as above.

    [PATCH] suspend regression: sysfs deadlock
    
    Suspend deadlocks when trying to unregister /sys/block/sr0.
    
    This comes from Oliver's commit 94bebf4d1b8e7719f0f3944c037a21cfd99a4af7
    "Driver core: fix race in sysfs between sysfs_remove_file() and
    read()/write()".
    
    sysfs_write_file downs buffer->sem while calling flush_write_buffer, and
    flushing that particular write buffer entails downing buffer->sem in
    orphan_all_buffers, resulting in the obvious self-deadlock.

    [IA64] kexec: Use EFI_LOADER_DATA for ELF core header
    
    The address where the ELF core header is stored is passed to the secondary
    kernel as a kernel command line option.  The memory area for this header is
    also marked as a separate EFI memory descriptor on ia64.
    
    The separate EFI memory descriptor is at the moment of the type
    EFI_UNUSABLE_MEMORY.  With such a type the secondary kernel skips over the
    entire memory granule (config option, 16M or 64M) when detecting memory.
    If we are lucky we will just lose some memory, but if we happen to have
    data in the same granule (such as an initramfs image), then this data will
    never get mapped and the kernel bombs out when trying to access it.
    
    So this is an attempt to fix this by changing the EFI memory descriptor
    type into EFI_LOADER_DATA.  This type is the same type used for the kernel
    data and for initramfs.  In the secondary kernel we then handle the ELF
    core header data the same way as we handle the initramfs image.
    
    This patch contains the kernel changes to make this happen.  Pretty
    straightforward, we reserve the area in reserve_memory().  The address for
    the area comes from the kernel command line and the size comes from the
    specialized EFI parsing function vmcore_find_descriptor_size().
    
    The kexec-tools-testing code for this can be found here:

    [IA64] permon use-after-free fix
    
    Perfmon associates vmalloc()ed memory with a file descriptor, and installs
    a vma mapping that memory.  Unfortunately, the vm_file field is not filled
    in, so processes with mappings to that memory do not prevent the file from
    being closed and the memory freed.  This results in use-after-free bugs and
    multiple freeing of pages, etc.
    
    I saw this bug on an Altix on SLES9.  Haven't reproduced upstream but it
    looks like the same issue is there.

    Always build ia64 xor.o because multiple config options now depend on it.
    
    Necessary to build .20-mm* on ia64 when, e.g., CONFIG_ASYNC_TX_DMA is

    Kconfig should preclude it.
    
    Could have defined a Kconfig option that defaults to true if MD_RAID456 ||
    ASYNC_TX_DMA to control building of xor.o, but xor.o is only 848 bytes and
    this IS ia64...

    [IA64] point saved_max_pfn to the max_pfn of the entire system
    
    Make saved_max_pfn point to max_pfn of entire system.
    
    Without this patch is so that vmcore is zero length on ia64.  This is
    because saved_max_pfn was wrongly being set to the max_pfn of the crash
    kernel's address space, rather than the max_pfg on the physical memory of
    the machine - the whole purpose of vmcore is to access physical memory that
    is not part of the crash kernel's addresss space.

    The struct rdma_bind_list fields for hlist are not being initialized,

    RDMA/cxgb3: Start ep timer on a MPA reject
    
    If the consumer rejects the connection we end up under-referencing the
    endpoint structure.  The fix is to call iwch_ep_disconnect() instead
    of the low level disconnect functions so that the endpoint close timer
    is started correctly.

    [NET]: Revert incorrect accept queue backlog changes.
    
    This reverts two changes:
    
    8488df894d05d6fa41c2bd298c335f944bb0e401
    248f06726e866942b3d8ca8f411f9067713b7ff8
    
    A backlog value of N really does mean allow "N + 1" connections
    to queue to a listening socket.  This allows one to specify
    "0" as the backlog and still get 1 connection.

    [PATCH] knfsd: provide sunrpc pool_mode module option
    
    Provide a module param "pool_mode" for sunrpc.ko which allows a sysadmin to
    choose the mode for mapping NFS thread service pools to CPUs.  Values are:
    
    auto	    choose a mapping mode heuristically
    global	    (default, same as the pre-2.6.19 code) a single global pool
    percpu	    one pool per CPU
    pernode	    one pool per NUMA node
    
    Note that since 2.6.19 the hardcoded behaviour has been "auto", this patch
    makes the default "global".
    
    The pool mode can be changed after boot/modprobe using /sys, if the NFS and
    lockd services have been shut down.  A useful side effect of this change is to
    fix a small memory leak when unloading the module.

    [PATCH] knfsd: fix recently introduced problem with shutting down a busy NFS server
    
    When the last thread of nfsd exits, it shuts down all related sockets.  It
    currently uses svc_close_socket to do this, but that only is immediately
    effective if the socket is not SK_BUSY.
    
    If the socket is busy - i.e.  if a request has arrived that has not yet been
    processes - svc_close_socket is not effective and the shutdown process spins.
    
    So create a new svc_force_close_socket which removes the SK_BUSY flag is set
    and then calls svc_close_socket.
    
    Also change some open-codes loops in svc_destroy to use
    list_for_each_entry_safe.

    [PATCH] knfsd: use recv_msg to get peer address for NFSD instead of code-copying
    
    The sunrpc server code needs to know the source and destination address for
    UDP packets so it can reply properly.  It currently copies code out of the
    network stack to pick the pieces out of the skb.  This is ugly and causes
    compile problems with the IPv6 stuff.
    
    So, rip that out and use recv_msg instead.  This is a much cleaner interface,
    but has a slight cost in that the checksum is now checked before the copy, so
    we don't benefit from doing both at the same time.  This can probably be
    fixed.

    [PATCH] cciss: fix for 2TB support
    
    This patch changes the way we determine if a logical volume is larger than
    2TB.
    
    The original test looked for a total_size of 0.  Originally we added 1 to the
    total_size.  That would make our read_capacity return size 0 for >2TB lv's.
    We assumed that we could not have a lv size of 0 so it seemed OK until we were
    in a clustered system.  The backup node would see a size of 0 due to the
    reservation on the drive.  That caused the driver to switch to 16-byte CDB's
    which are not supported on older controllers.  After that everything was
    broken.
    
    It may seem petty but I don't see the value in trying to determine if the LBA
    is beyond the 2TB boundary.  That's why when we switch we use 16-byte CDB's
    for all read/write operations.  Please consider this for inclusion.

    rcutorture does all of its initialization and thread startup when loaded

    [PATCH] highres: do not run the TIMER_SOFTIRQ after switching to highres mode
    
    The TIMER_SOFTIRQ runs the hrtimers during bootup until a usable
    clocksource and clock event sources are registered.  The switch to high
    resolution mode happens inside of the TIMER_SOFTIRQ, but runs the softirq
    afterwards.  That way the tick emulation timer, which was set up in the
    switch to highres might be executed in the softirq context, which is a BUG.
     The rbtree has not to be touched by the softirq after the highres switch.
    
    This BUG was observed by Andres Salomon, who provided the information to
    debug it.
    
    Return early from the softirq, when the switch was sucessful.

    [PATCH] i386: make x86_64 tsc header require i386 rather than vice-versa
    
    Prior to commit 95492e4646e5de8b43d9a7908d6177fb737b61f0 ([PATCH] x86:
    rewrite SMP TSC sync code), the headers in asm-i386 did not really require
    anything in include/asm-x86_64.  This means that distributions such as
    fedora did not include asm-x86_64 in kernel-devel headers for i386.  Ingo's
    commit changed that, and broke things.  This is easy enough to hack around
    in package builds by just including asm-x86_64 on i386, but that's kind of
    annoying.  If anything, x86_64 should depend upon i386, not the other way
    around.
    
    This patch changes it so that asm-x86_64/tsc.h includes asm-i386/tsc.h,
    rather than vice-versa.

    [PATCH] Fix 2.6.21 rfcomm lockups
    
    Any attempt to open/use a bluetooth rfcomm device locks up
    scheduling completely on my machine.
    
    Interrupts (ping, alt-sysrq) seem to be alive, but nothing else.
    
    This was working fine in 2.6.20, broken now in 2.6.21-rc2-git*
    
    Reverting this change (below) fixes it:

    The simplest fix for this bug is to prevent sysfs_move_dir()
    from self-deadlocking when (old_parent == new_parent).
    
    This patch prevents total system lockup when using rfcomm devices.

    [PATCH] Save/restore periodic tick information over suspend/resume
    
    The programming of periodic tick devices needs to be saved/restored
    across suspend/resume - otherwise we might end up with a system coming
    up that relies on getting a PIT (or HPET) interrupt, while those devices
    default to 'no interrupts' after powerup. (To confuse things it worked
    to a certain degree on some systems because the lapic gets initialized
    as a side-effect of SMP bootup.)
    
    This suspend / resume thing was dropped unintentionally during the
    last-minute -mm code reshuffling.

    sdhci: make isr tolerant of read errors
    
    The interrupt is shared with another device, which resumes earlier than the
    sdhci controller, and generates an interrupt.
    
    The sdhci interrupt handler runs, sees 0xffffffff in its own device's
    interrupt status, and tries to handle it..  The reason for the 0xffffffff
    is that the device is still suspended, and *all* regs are reading back
    0xffffffff.

    mv643xx_eth: Place explicit port number in mv643xx_eth_platform_data
    
    We were using the platform_device.id field to identify which ethernet
    port is used for mv643xx_eth device.  This is not generally correct.
    It will be incorrect, for example, if a hardware platform uses a single
    port but not the first port.  Here, we add an explicit port_number field
    to struct mv643xx_eth_platform_data.
    
    This makes the mv643xx_eth_platform_data structure required, but that
    isn't an issue since all users currently provide it already.

    bonding: Improve IGMP join processing
    
    	In active-backup mode, the current bonding code duplicates IGMP
    traffic to all slaves, so that switches are up to date in case of a
    failover from an active to a backup interface.  If bonding then fails
    back to the original active interface, it is likely that the "active
    slave" switch's IGMP forwarding for the port will be out of date until
    some event occurs to refresh the switch (e.g., a membership query).
    
    	This patch alters the behavior of bonding to no longer flood
    IGMP to all ports, and to issue IGMP JOINs to the newly active port at
    the time of a failover.  This insures that switches are kept up to date
    for all cases.
    
    	"GOELLESCH Niels" <niels.goellesch@eurocontrol.int> originally
    reported this problem, and included a patch.  His original patch was
    modified by Jay Vosburgh to additionally remove the existing IGMP flood
    behavior, use RCU, streamline code paths, fix trailing white space, and
    adjust for style.

    bonding: fix double dev_add_pack
    
    	Bonding can erroneously register the same packet_type to receive
    ARPs (for use by ARP validation): once at device open time, and once via
    sysfs.  Since sysfs can change the validate setting (and thus register
    or unregister) at any time, a flag is needed to synchronize with device
    open in order to avoid double registrations, and the simplest place is
    within the packet_type structure itself.  Double unregister is not an
    issue.

    pata_pdc202xx_old: fix data corruption and other problems
    
    Fix wrong "port" calculations in pdc202xx_{configure_piomode,set_dmamode}()
    They were broken for all configurations except one (master device on primary
    channel, no other devices) and as a result device settings + PIO/DMA timings
    were being programmed into the wrong PCI registers.  This could result in
    a large variety of problems including data corruption, hangs etc. (depending
    on devices used and your luck :-).
    
      ap->port_no   ap->devno   used PCI registers   correct PCI registers
                0           0            0x60-0x62               0x60-0x62

    Also forward port recent fixes from drivers/ide pdc202xx_old driver:
    
    * fix XFER_MW_DMA0 timings (they were overclocked, use the official ones)
    
    * fix bitmasks for clearing bits of register B:
    
      - when programming DMA mode bit 0x10 of register B was cleared which
        resulted in overclocked PIO timing setting (iff PIO0 was used)
    
      - when programming PIO mode bits 0x18 weren't cleared so suboptimal
        timings were used for PIO1-4 if PIO0 was previously set (bit 0x10)
        and for PIO0/3/4 if PIO1/2 was previously set (bit 0x08)
    
    and finally bump driver version.

    pata_legacy: fix io/irq mismatch
    
    pata_legacy fails to detect the disk on my old ISA/VLB 486:
    it starts to probe io=0x1f0 ctr=0x3f6 irq=15, complains
    loudly about IDENTIFYs timing out, and finally fails.
    (Sorry I couldn't capture the kernel's boot messages.)
    
    It turns out that the driver's mapping from io to irq in
    legacy_irq[] is wrong: index 0 for io=0x1f0 has irq=15 but
    should have irq=14, and index 1 for io=0x170 has irq=14 but
    should have irq=15. This is confirmed by a comparison with
    include/asm-i386/ide.h:ide_default_irq().
    
    This patch swaps the first two elements in legacy_irq[],
    which makes pata_legacy work on my 486.

    [S390] Fixed handling of access register mode faults.
    
    Replaced check_user_space() + __check_access_register with the new
    check_space(). The old functions made wrong assumptions about kernel
    and user space when the kernel and user address spaces are switched
    (kernel in home space, user in primary/secondary space).
    Secondly the user process can switch to the accress register mode if
    it is running in primary or secondary mode. In addition it can load
    an arbitrary value to the access registers. If any other value than
    0 for primary space or 1 for secondary space is loaded and memory
    is accessed using the base register related to the access register,
    the program should be terminated with a SIGSEGV. To achieve that the
    DUALD pointer in the DUCT and the PSALD pointer in the PASTE need
    to point to an array of 8 invalid access-list entries to get a
    ALEN-translation exception if an invalid alet is used.

    [S390] dasd: Use default recovery for SNSS requests
    
    For extended error reporting we sometimes have to start an
    Sense Subsystem Status request (SNSS). When this request needs
    to be recovered for some reason, the recovery request will
    fail with 'command reject'.
    Our usual recovery procedure will retry the failed request by
    creating a new request and chaining the failed request from that
    one. SNSS requests, though, must not be chained from anything,
    so the recovery request will fail permanently.
    Use the default recovery for SNSS request, which will just restart
    the original request without further ado.

    [NETFILTER]: conntrack: fix {nf,ip}_ct_iterate_cleanup endless loops
    
    Fix {nf,ip}_ct_iterate_cleanup unconfirmed list handling:
    
    - unconfirmed entries can not be killed manually, they are removed on
      confirmation or final destruction of the conntrack entry, which means
      we might iterate forever without making forward progress.
    
      This can happen in combination with the conntrack event cache, which
      holds a reference to the conntrack entry, which is only released when
      the packet makes it all the way through the stack or a different
      packet is handled.
    
    - taking references to an unconfirmed entry and using it outside the
      locked section doesn't work, the list entries are not refcounted and
      another CPU might already be waiting to destroy the entry
    
    What the code really wants to do is make sure the references of the hash
    table to the selected conntrack entries are released, so they will be
    destroyed once all references from skbs and the event cache are dropped.
    
    Since unconfirmed entries haven't even entered the hash yet, simply mark
    them as dying and skip confirmation based on that.

    [PATCH] paravirt: re-enable COMPAT_VDSO
    
    CONFIG_PARAVIRT broke old glibc bootup: it silently turned off the
    selectability of CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO and thus rendered distro kernels
    unbootable on old-style VDSO glibc setups.
    
    the proper solution is to keep COMPAT_VDSO available - if a hypervisor
    needs any modification of that concept then we'll judge those changes in
    full context, once those changes are submitted.

    [PATCH] disable NMI watchdog by default
    
    there's a new NMI watchdog related problem: KVM crashes on certain
    bzImages because ... we enable the NMI watchdog by default (even if the
    user does not ask for it) , and no other OS on this planet does that so
    KVM doesnt have emulation for that yet. So KVM injects a #GP, which
    crashes the Linux guest:
    
     general protection fault: 0000 [#1]
     PREEMPT SMP

     CPU:    0

     EFLAGS: 00000246   (2.6.20-rc5-rt0 #3)
     EIP is at setup_apic_nmi_watchdog+0x26d/0x3d3
    
    and no, i did /not/ request an nmi_watchdog on the boot command line!
    
    Solution: turn off that darn thing! It's a debug tool, not a 'make life
    harder' tool!!
    
    with this patch the KVM guest boots up just fine.
    
    And with this my laptop (Lenovo T60) also stopped its sporadic hard
    hanging (sometimes in acpi_init(), sometimes later during bootup,
    sometimes much later during actual use) as well. It hung with both
    nmi_watchdog=1 and nmi_watchdog=2, so it's generally the fact of NMI
    injection that is causing problems, not the NMI watchdog variant, nor
    any particular bootup code.

    Clarify the description of the CONFIG_VMI option: describe the reality

    another hypervisor adopts the VMI ABI we can change the text.
    
    As can be seen from the Xen paravirtualization patches submitted to lkml
    the Xen project has chosen its own, non-VMI interface between Xen and
    the para-Linux - so remove Xen from the description.

    [PATCH] video/aty/mach64_ct.c: fix bogus delay loop
    
    CT based mach64 cards were reported to hang on sparc64 boxes when
    compiled with gcc-4.1.x and later.
    
    Looking at this piece of code, it's no surprise.  A critical
    delay was implemented as an empty for() loop, and gcc 4.0.x
    and previous did not optimize it away, so we did get a delay.
    
    But gcc-4.1.x and later can optimize it away, and we get crashes.
    
    Use a real udelay() to fix this.  Fix verified on SunBlade100.

    [PATCH] timer/hrtimer: take per cpu locks in sane order
    
    Doing something like this on a two cpu system
    
      # echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/online
      # echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/online
      # echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
    
    will give me this:
    
      =======================================================
      [ INFO: possible circular locking dependency detected ]
      2.6.21-rc2-g562aa1d4-dirty #7
      -------------------------------------------------------
      bash/1282 is trying to acquire lock:
       (&cpu_base->lock_key){.+..}, at: [<000000000005f17e>] hrtimer_cpu_notify+0xc6/0x240
    
      but task is already holding lock:
       (&cpu_base->lock_key#2){.+..}, at: [<000000000005f174>] hrtimer_cpu_notify+0xbc/0x240
    
      which lock already depends on the new lock.
    
    This happens because we have the following code in kernel/hrtimer.c:
    
      migrate_hrtimers(int cpu)
      [...]
      old_base = &per_cpu(hrtimer_bases, cpu);
      new_base = &get_cpu_var(hrtimer_bases);
      [...]
      spin_lock(&new_base->lock);
      spin_lock(&old_base->lock);
    
    Which means the spinlocks are taken in an order which depends on which cpu
    gets shut down from which other cpu. Therefore lockdep complains that there
    might be an ABBA deadlock. Since migrate_hrtimers() gets only called on
    cpu hotplug it's safe to assume that it isn't executed concurrently on a
    
    The same problem exists in kernel/timer.c: migrate_timers().
    
    As pointed out by Christian Borntraeger one possible solution to avoid
    the locking order complaints would be to make sure that the locks are
    always taken in the same order. E.g. by taking the lock of the cpu with
    the lower number first.
    
    To achieve this we introduce two new spinlock functions double_spin_lock
    and double_spin_unlock which lock or unlock two locks in a given order.

    [PATCH] clocksource init adjustments (fix bug #7426)
    
    This patch resolves the issue found here:
    http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7426
    
    The basic summary is:
    Currently we register most of i386/x86_64 clocksources at module_init
    time. Then we enable clocksource selection at late_initcall time. This
    causes some problems for drivers that use gettimeofday for init
    calibration routines (specifically the es1968 driver in this case),
    where durring module_init, the only clocksource available is the low-res
    jiffies clocksource. This may cause slight calibration errors, due to
    the small sampling time used.
    
    It should be noted that drivers that require fine grained time may not
    function on architectures that do not have better then jiffies
    resolution timekeeping (there are a few). However, this does not
    discount the reasonable need for such fine-grained timekeeping at init
    time.
    
    Thus the solution here is to register clocksources earlier (ideally when
    the hardware is being initialized), and then we enable clocksource
    selection at fs_initcall (before device_initcall).
    
    This patch should probably get some testing time in -mm, since
    clocksource selection is one of the most important issues for correct
    timekeeping, and I've only been able to test this on a few of my own
    boxes.

    [PATCH] md: fix for raid6 reshape
    
    Recent patch for raid6 reshape had a change missing that showed up in
    subsequent review.
    
    Many places in the raid5 code used "conf->raid_disks-1" to mean "number of
    data disks".  With raid6 that had to be changed to "conf->raid_disk -
    conf->max_degraded" or similar.  One place was missed.
    
    This bug means that if a raid6 reshape were aborted in the middle the
    recorded position would be wrong.  On restart it would either fail (as the
    position wasn't on an appropriate boundary) or would leave a section of the
    array unreshaped, causing data corruption.

    [PATCH] vmi: apic ops
    
    Use para_fill instead of directly setting the APIC ops to the result of the
    vmi_get_function call - this allows one to implement a VMI ROM without
    implementing APIC functions, just using the native APIC functions.
    
    While doing this, I realized that there is a lot more cleanup that should have
    been done.  Basically, we should never assume that the ROM implements a
    specific set of functions, and always allow fallback to the native
    implementation.
    
    This is critical for future compatibility.

    [PATCH] vmi: pit override
    
    The time_init_hook in paravirt-ops no longer functions in the correct manner
    after the integration of the hrtimers code.  The problem is that now the call
    path for time initialization is:
    
      time_init :
           late_time_init = hpet_time_init;
    
      late_time_init -> hpet_time_init:
           setup_pit_timer (BAD)
           do_time_init --> (via paravirt.h)
              time_init_hook --> (via arch_hooks.h)
                  time_init_hook (in SUBARCH/setup.c)
    
    If this isn't confusing enough, the paravirt case goes through an indirect
    function pointer in the paravirt-ops table.  The problem is, by the time the
    paravirt hook is called, the pit timer is already enabled.
    
    But paravirt guests have their own timer, and don't want to use the PIT.
    Rather than intensify the struggle for power going on here, just make it all
    nice and simple and just unconditionally do all timer setup in the
    late_time_init hook.  This also has the advantage of enabling timers in the
    same place in all code paths, so everyone has the same bugs and we don't have
    outliers who break other code because they turn on timer too early or too
    late.
    
    So the paravirt-ops time init function is now by default hpet_time_init, which
    is the time init function used for native hardware.  Paravirt guests have the
    chance to override this when they setup the paravirt-ops table, and should
    need no change.

    [PATCH] vmi: paravirt drop udelay op
    
    Not respecting udelay causes problems with any virtual hardware that is passed
    through to real hardware.  This can be noticed by any device that interacts
    with the real world in real time - like AP startup, which takes real time.  Or
    keyboard LEDs, which should blink in real-time.  Or floppy drives, but only
    when passed through to a real floppy controller on OSes which can't
    sufficiently buffer the floppy commands to emulate a zero latency floppy.  Or
    IDE drives, when connecting to a physical CDROM.
    
    This was mostly a hack to get the kernel to boot faster, but it introduced a
    number of misvirtualization bugs, and Alan and Pavel argued pretty strongly
    against it.  We were the only client, and now want to clean up this cruft.

    [PATCH] vmi: fix highpte
    
    Provide a PT map hook for HIGHPTE kernels to designate where they are mapping
    page tables.  This information is required so the physical address of PTE
    updates can be determined; otherwise, the mm layer would have to carry the
    physical address all the way to each PTE modification callsite, which is even
    more hideous that the macros required to provide the proper hooks.
    
    So lets not mess up arch neutral code to achieve this, but keep the horror in
    an #ifdef HIGHPTE in include/asm-i386/pgtable.h.  I had to use macros here
    because some types are not yet defined in all the include paths for this
    header.
    
    This patch is absolutely required for HIGHPTE kernels to operate properly with
    VMI.

    make accurate time calculations with the cycle counters.

    [PATCH] vmi: sched clock paravirt op fix
    
    The custom_sched_clock hook is broken.  The result from sched_clock needs to
    be in nanoseconds, not in CPU cycles.  The TSC is insufficient for this
    purpose, because TSC is poorly defined in a virtual environment, and mostly
    represents real world time instead of scheduled process time (which can be
    interrupted without notice when a virtual machine is descheduled).
    
    To make the scheduler consistent, we must expose a different nature of time,
    that is scheduled time.  So deprecate this custom_sched_clock hack and turn it
    into a paravirt-op, as it should have been all along.  This allows the tsc.c
    code which converts cycles to nanoseconds to be shared by all paravirt-ops
    backends.
    
    It is unfortunate to add a new paravirt-op, but this is a very distinct
    abstraction which is clearly different for all virtual machine
    implementations, and it gets rid of an ugly indirect function which I
    ashamedly admit I hacked in to try to get this to work earlier, and then even
    got in the wrong units.

    [PATCH] vmi: timer fixes round two
    
    Critical bugfixes for the VMI-Timer code.
    
    1) Do not setup a one shot alarm if we are keeping the periodic alarm
       armed.  Additionally, since the periodic alarm can be run at a lower rate
       than HZ, let's fixup the guard to the no-idle-hz mode appropriately.  This
       fixes the bug where the no-idle-hz mode might have a higher interrupt rate
       than the non-idle case.
    
    2) The interrupt handler can no longer adjust xtime due to nested lock
       acquisition.  Drop this.  We don't need to check for wallclock time at
       every tick, it can be done in userspace instead.
    
    3) Add a bypass to disable noidle operation.  This is useful as a last
       minute workaround, or testing measure.
    
    4) The code to skip the IO_APIC timer testing (no_timer_check) should be
       conditional on IO_APIC, not SMP, since UP kernels can have this configured
       in as well.

    [PATCH] fb: sm501fb off-by-1 sysfs store
    
    Currently sm501fb_crtsrc_store() won't allow the routing to be changed via
    echos from userspace in to the sysfs file.  The reason for this is that the
    strnicmp() for both heads uses a sizeof() for the string length, which ends
    up being strlen() + 1 (\0 in the normal case, but the echo gives a newline,
    which is where the issue occurs), this then causes a mismatch and
    subsequently bails with the -EINVAL.
    
    In addition to this, the hardcoded lengths were then used for the store
    length that was returned, which ended up being erroneous and resulting in a
    write error.  There's also no point in returning anything but the full
    length since it will -EINVAL out on a mismatch well before then anyways.
    
    sizeof("string") is great for making sure you have space in your buffer,
    but rather less so for string comparisons :-)

    [PATCH] sched: remove SMT nice
    
    Remove the SMT-nice feature which idles sibling cpus on SMT cpus to
    facilitiate nice working properly where cpu power is shared.  The idling of
    cpus in the presence of runnable tasks is considered too fragile, easy to
    break with outside code, and the complexity of managing this system if an
    architecture comes along with many logical cores sharing cpu power will be
    unworkable.
    
    Remove the associated per_cpu_gain variable in sched_domains used only by
    this code.
    
    Also:
    
      The reason is that with dynticks enabled, this code breaks without yet
      further tweaks so dynticks brought on the rapid demise of this code.  So
      either we tweak this code or kill it off entirely.  It was Ingo's preference
      to kill it off.  Either way this needs to happen for 2.6.21 since dynticks
      has gone in.

    [PATCH] add CONFIG_GENERIC_GPIO
    
    Most drivers using GPIOs already know they are running on a system that
    supports the generic GPIO calls, because of other platform dependencies.
    But the generic GPIO-based LED and input button drivers can't know that.
    
    So this patch adds a Kconfig hook, GENERIC_GPIO, to mark the platforms
    where <asm/gpio.h> will do the right thing.  Currently that's a bunch of
    ARMs, and AVR32; more are on the way.
    
    It also fixes a dependency bug for the gpio button input driver; it was
    wrong to start with, now it covers all platforms with GENERIC_GPIO.

    [PATCH] Fix soft lockup with iSeries viocd driver
    
    Fix soft lockup with iSeries viocd driver, caused by eventually calling
    end_that_request_first() with nr_bytes 0.
    
    Some versions of hald do an SG_IO ioctl on the viocd device which becomes a
    request with hard_nr_sectors and hard_cur_sectors set to zero.  Passing zero
    as the number of sectors to end_request() (which calls
    end_that_request_first()) causes an infinite loop when the bio is being freed.
    
    This patch makes sure that the zero is never passed.  It only requires some
    number larger the the request size the terminate the loop.
    
    The lockup is triggered by hald, interrogating the device.

    [PATCH] msi: support masking msi irqs without a mask bit
    
    For devices that do not support msi-x we only support 1 interrupt.  Therefore
    we can disable that one interrupt by disabling the msi capability itself.  If
    we leave the intx interrupts disabled while we have the msi capability
    disabled no interrupts should be delivered from that device.
    
    Devices with just the minimal msi support (and thus hitting this code path)
    include things like the intel e1000 nic, so it looks like is going to be a
    fairly common case and thus important to get right.

    [PATCH] msi: fix up the msi enable/disable logic
    
    enable/disable_msi_mode have several side effects which keeps them from being
    generally useful.  So this patch replaces them with with two much more
    targeted functions: msi_set_enable and msix_set_enable.
    
    This patch makes pci_dev->msi_enabled and pci_dev->msix_enabled the definitive
    way to test if linux has enabled the msi capability, and has the appropriate
    msi data structures set up.
    
    This patch ensures that while writing the msi messages in save/restore and
    during device initialization we have the msi capability disabled so we don't
    get into races.  The pci spec requires that we do not have the msi capability
    enabled and the msi messages unmasked while we write the messages.  Completely
    disabling the capability is overkill but it is easy :)
    
    Care has been taken so we never have both a msi capability and intx enabled
    simultaneously.  We haven't run into a problem yet but better safe then sorry.

    [PATCH] msi: sanely support hardware level msi disabling
    
    In some cases when we are not using msi we need a way to ensure that the
    hardware does not have an msi capability enabled.  Currently the code has been
    calling disable_msi_mode to try and achieve that.  However disable_msi_mode
    has several other side effects and is only available when msi support is
    compiled in so it isn't really appropriate.
    
    Instead this patch implements pci_msi_off which disables all msi and msix
    capabilities unconditionally with no additional side effects.
    
    pci_disable_device was redundantly clearing the bus master enable flag and
    clearing the msi enable bit.  A device that is not allowed to perform bus
    mastering operations cannot generate intx or msi interrupt messages as those
    are essentially a special case of dma, and require bus mastering.  So the call
    in pci_disable_device to disable msi capabilities was redundant.
    
    quirk_pcie_pxh also called disable_msi_mode and is updated to use pci_msi_off.

    [ARM] ARM SCSI: Don't try to dma_map_sg too many scatterlist entries
    
    An off-by-one bug meant we were always trying to map one too many
    scatterlist entries.  This was mostly harmless prior to the checks
    going in to consistent_sync(), but now causes the kernel to BUG.
    
    Also, powertec.c was missing an assignment to info->ec.

    KVM: Fix bogus failure in kvm.ko module initialization
    
    A bogus 'return r' can cause an otherwise successful module load to fail.
    This both denies users the use of kvm, and it also denies them the use of

    KVM: Per-vcpu inodes
    
    Allocate a distinct inode for every vcpu in a VM.  This has the following
    benefits:
    
     - the filp cachelines are no longer bounced when f_count is incremented on
       every ioctl()
     - the API and internal code are distinctly clearer; for example, on the
       KVM_GET_REGS ioctl, there is no need to copy the vcpu number from
       userspace and then copy the registers back; the vcpu identity is derived
       from the fd used to make the call
    
    Right now the performance benefits are completely theoretical since (a) we
    don't support more than one vcpu per VM and (b) virtualization hardware
    inefficiencies completely everwhelm any cacheline bouncing effects.  But
    both of these will change, and we need to prepare the API today.

    ide: make legacy IDE VLB modules check for the "probe" kernel params (v2)
    
    Legacy IDE VLB host drivers didn't check for "probe" options when compiled
    as modules, which was obviously wrong as we don't want module to poke at
    random I/O ports by simply loading it.  Fix it by adding "probe" module param
    to legacy IDE VLB host drivers.

    [NetLabel]: Verify sensitivity level has a valid CIPSO mapping
    
    The current CIPSO engine has a problem where it does not verify that
    the given sensitivity level has a valid CIPSO mapping when the "std"
    CIPSO DOI type is used.  The end result is that bad packets are sent
    on the wire which should have never been sent in the first place.
    This patch corrects this problem by verifying the sensitivity level
    mapping similar to what is done with the category mapping.  This patch
    also changes the returned error code in this case to -EPERM to better
    match what the category mapping verification code returns.

    [PPPOE]: Key connections properly on local device.
    
    It is based on the assumption that an interface's ifindex is basically
    an alias for a local MAC address, so incoming packets now are matched
    to sockets based on remote MAC, session id, and ifindex of the
    interface the packet came in on/the socket was bound to by connect().
    
    For relayed packets, the socket that's used for relaying is selected
    based on destination MAC, session ID and the interface index of the
    interface whose name currently matches the name requested by userspace
    as the relaying source interface.

    	When a new SYN comes, TCP module first checks its validation. If valid,
    send SYN,ACK to the client and add the sock to the syn hash table. Next
    time if received the valid ACK for SYN,ACK from the client. server will
    accept this connection and increase the sk->sk_ack_backlog -- which is
    done in function tcp_check_req().We check wether acceptq is full in
    function tcp_v4_syn_recv_sock().
    
    Consider an example:
    
     After listen(sockfd, 1) system call, sk->sk_max_ack_backlog is set to
    1. As we know, sk->sk_ack_backlog is initialized to 0. Assuming accept()
    system call is not invoked now.
    
    1. 1st connection comes. invoke sk_acceptq_is_full(). sk-
    >sk_ack_backlog=0 sk->sk_max_ack_backlog=1, function return 0 accept
    this connection. Increase the sk->sk_ack_backlog
    2. 2nd connection comes. invoke sk_acceptq_is_full(). sk-
    >sk_ack_backlog=1 sk->sk_max_ack_backlog=1, function return 0 accept
    this connection. Increase the sk->sk_ack_backlog
    3. 3rd connection comes. invoke sk_acceptq_is_full(). sk-
    >sk_ack_backlog=2 sk->sk_max_ack_backlog=1, function return 1. Refuse
    this connection.
    
    I think it has bugs. after listen system call. sk->sk_max_ack_backlog=1
    but now it can accept 2 connections.

    [RADEON]: Fix blanking return value.
    
    If you'll recall, over a year ago, I pointed out that the current
    Radeon driver erroneously returns -EINVAL for valid blanking codes,
    here is a link to that thread:
    
    	http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/28/6
    
    No other driver does this, and it confuses the X server into thinking
    that the device does not support blanking properly.
    
    I looked again and there is simply no reason for the Radeon driver to
    return -EINVAL for FB_BLANK_NORMAL.  It claims it wants to do this in
    order to convince fbcon to blank in software, right here:
    
    			if (fb_blank(info, blank))
    				fbcon_generic_blank(vc, info, blank);
    
    to software blank the screen.  But it only causes that to happen
    in the FB_BLANK_NORMAL case.
    
    That makes no sense because the Radeon code does this:
    
    		val |= CRTC_DISPLAY_DIS;
    
    in the FB_BLANK_NORMAL case so should be blanking the hardware, and
    there is therefore no reason to SW blank by returning -EINVAL.

    [libata] change master/slave IDENTIFY order
    
    2.6.21-rc has horrible problems with libata and PATA cable types (and
    thus speeds). This occurs because Tejun fixed a pile of other bugs and
    we now do cable detect enforcement for drive side detection properly.
    
    Unfortunately we don't do the process around cable detection right. Tejun
    identified the problem and pointed to the right Annex in the spec, this patch
    implements the needed changes.
    
    The basic requirement is that we have to identify the slave before the
    master.
    
    The patch switches the identify order so that we can do the drive side
    detection correctly.

    libata-core: Fix simplex handling
    
    The initial simplex handling code is fooled if you suspend and resume.
    This also causes problems with some single channel controllers which
    claim to be simplex.
    
    The fix is fairly simple, instead of keeping a flag to remember if we
    gave away the simplex channel we remember the actual owner. As the owner
    is always part of the host_set we don't even need a refcount.
    
    Knowing the owner also means we can reassign simplex DMA channels in
    future hotplug code etc if we need to

    ARM: OMAP: dmtimer.c omap1 register fix
    
    When I went to use dmtimer7 it did not seem to work.  I noticed that
    the base addresses for dmtimers 7 and 8 were set wrong.  A simple patch
    to correct a small error.  Confirmed to fix the problem on an OSK.

    Make jmiron_ata quirk update pdev->class after programming the device
    and update ahci and pata_jmicron such that they match class code
    instead of checking function number manually.  For ahci, it matches
    for vendor and class.  For pata_jmicron, it matches vendor, device and
    class as IDE class isn't as well defined as AHCI class.
    
    This makes jmicron device matching more conventional and script

    [PATCH] Fix get_unmapped_area and fsync for hugetlb shm segments
    
    This patch provides the following hugetlb-related fixes to the recent stacked
    shm files changes:
     - Update is_file_hugepages() so it will reconize hugetlb shm segments.
     - get_unmapped_area must be called with the nested file struct to handle
       the sfd->file->f_ops->get_unmapped_area == NULL case.
     - The fsync f_op must be wrapped since it is specified in the hugetlbfs
       f_ops.
    
    This is based on proposed fixes from Eric Biederman that were debugged and
    tested by me.  Without it, attempting to use hugetlb shared memory segments
    on powerpc (and likely ia64) will kill your box.

    [PATCH] tty_io: fix race in master pty close/slave pty close path
    
    This patch fixes a possible race that leads to double freeing an idr index.
     When the master begin to close, release_dev() is called and then
    pty_close() is called:
    
            if (tty->driver->close)
                    tty->driver->close(tty, filp);
    
    This is done without helding any locks other than BKL.  Inside pty_close(),
    being a master close, the devpts entry will be removed:
    
    #ifdef CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS
                    if (tty->driver == ptm_driver)
                            devpts_pty_kill(tty->index);
    #endif
    
    But devpts_pty_kill() will call get_node() that may sleep while waiting for
    &devpts_root->d_inode->i_sem.  When this happens and the slave is being
    opened, tty_open() just found the driver and index:
    
            driver = get_tty_driver(device, &index);
            if (!driver) {
                    mutex_unlock(&tty_mutex);
                    return -ENODEV;
            }
    
    This part of the code is already protected under tty_mute.  The problem is
    that the slave close already got an index.  Then init_dev() is called and
    blocks waiting for the same &devpts_root->d_inode->i_sem.
    
    When the master close resumes, it removes the devpts entry, and the
    relation between idr index and the tty is gone.  The master then sleeps
    waiting for the tty_mutex on release_dev().
    
    Slave open resumes and found no tty for that index.  As result, a NULL tty
    is returned and init_dev() doesn't flow to fast_track:
    
            /* check whether we're reopening an existing tty */
            if (driver->flags & TTY_DRIVER_DEVPTS_MEM) {
                    tty = devpts_get_tty(idx);
                    if (tty && driver->subtype == PTY_TYPE_MASTER)
                            tty = tty->link;
            } else {
                    tty = driver->ttys[idx];
            }
            if (tty) goto fast_track;
    
    The result of this, is that a new tty will be created and init_dev() returns
    sucessfull. After returning, tty_mutex is dropped and master close may resume.
    
    Master close finds it's the only use and both sides are closing, then releases
    the tty and the index. At this point, the idr index is free, but slave still
    has it.
    
    Slave open then calls pty_open() and finds that tty->link->count is 0,
    because there's no master and returns error.  Then tty_open() calls
    release_dev() which executes without any warning, as it was a case of last
    slave close when the master is already closed (master->count == 0,
    slave->count == 1).  The tty is then released with the already released idr
    index.
    
    This normally would only issue a warning on idr_remove() but in case of a
    customer's critical application, it's never too simple:
    
    thread1: opens master, gets index X
    thread1: begin closing master
    thread2: begin opening slave with index X
    thread1: finishes closing master, index X released
    thread3: opens master, gets index X, just released
    thread2: fails opening slave, releases index X         <----
    thread4: opens master, gets index X, init_dev() then find an already in use
    	 and healthy tty and fails
    
    If no more indexes are released, ptmx_open() will keep failing, as the
    first free index available is X, and it will make init_dev() fail because
    you're trying to "reopen a master" which isn't valid.
    
    The patch notices when this race happens and make init_dev() fail
    imediately.  The init_dev() function is called with tty_mutex held, so it's
    safe to continue with tty till the end of function because release_dev()
    won't make any further changes without grabbing the tty_mutex.
    
    Without the patch, on some machines it's possible get easily idr warnings
    like this one:

    page_lock_anon_vma() uses spin_lock() to block RCU.  This doesn't work with

    theoretically possible that slab returns anon_vma's memory to the system
    before we do spin_unlock(&anon_vma->lock).

    [PATCH] sched: fix SMT scheduler bug
    
    The SMT scheduler incorrectly skips kernel threads even if they are
    runnable (but they are preempted by a higher-prio user-space task which got
    SMT-delayed by an even higher-priority task running on a sibling CPU).
    
    Fix this for now by only doing the SMT-nice optimization if the
    to-be-delayed task is the only runnable task.  (This should cover most of
    the real-life cases anyway.)
    
    This bug has been in the SMT scheduler since 2.6.17 or so, but has only
    been noticed now by the active check in the dynticks code.

    [PATCH] ext[34]: EA block reference count racing fix
    
    There are race issues around ext[34] xattr block release code.
    
    ext[34]_xattr_release_block() checks the reference count of xattr block
    (h_refcount) and frees that xattr block if it is the last one reference it.
     Unlike ext2, the check of this counter is unprotected by any lock.
    ext[34]_xattr_release_block() will free the mb_cache entry before freeing
    that xattr block.  There is a small window between the check for the re
    h_refcount ==1 and the call to mb_cache_entry_free().  During this small
    window another inode might find this xattr block from the mbcache and reuse
    it, racing a refcount updates.  The xattr block will later be freed by the
    first inode without notice other inode is still use it.  Later if that
    block is reallocated as a datablock for other file, then more serious
    problem might happen.
    
    We need put a lock around places checking the refount as well to avoid
    racing issue.  Another place need this kind of protection is in
    ext3_xattr_block_set(), where it will modify the xattr block content in-
    the-fly if the refcount is 1 (means it's the only inode reference it).
    
    This will also fix another issue: the xattr block may not get freed at all
    if no lock is to protect the refcount check at the release time.  It is
    possible that the last two inodes could release the shared xattr block at
    the same time.  But both of them think they are not the last one so only
    decreased the h_refcount without freeing xattr block at all.
    
    We need to call lock_buffer() after ext3_journal_get_write_access() to
    avoid deadlock (because the later will call lock_buffer()/unlock_buffer
    () as well).

    [PATCH] uml: host VDSO fix
    
    This fixes a problem seen by a number of people running UML on newer host
    kernels.  init would hang with an infinite segfault loop.
    
    It turns out that the host kernel was providing a AT_SYSINFO_EHDR of
    0xffffe000, which faked UML into believing that the host VDSO page could be
    reused.  However, AT_SYSINFO pointed into the middle of the address space, and
    was unmapped as a result.  Because UML was providing AT_SYSINFO_EHDR and
    AT_SYSINFO to its own processes, these would branch to nowhere when trying to
    use the VDSO.
    
    The fix is to also check the location of AT_SYSINFO when deciding whether to
    use the host's VDSO.

    [PATCH] fix section mismatch warning in lockdep
    
    lockdep_init() is marked __init but used in several places
    outside __init code. This causes following warnings:
    $ scripts/mod/modpost kernel/lockdep.o
    WARNING: kernel/built-in.o - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text:lockdep_init from .text.lockdep_init_map after 'lockdep_init_map' (at offset 0x105)
    WARNING: kernel/built-in.o - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text:lockdep_init from .text.lockdep_reset_lock after 'lockdep_reset_lock' (at offset 0x35)
    WARNING: kernel/built-in.o - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text:lockdep_init from .text.__lock_acquire after '__lock_acquire' (at offset 0xb2)
    
    The warnings are less obviously due to heavy inlining by gcc - this is not
    altered.
    
    Fix the section mismatch warnings by removing the __init marking, which
    seems obviously wrong.

    The problem is that the p->last_ran value is not updated after a context

    stale p->last_ran value, i.e.  accounts the full time, which the task was

    [PATCH] md: add support for reshape of a raid6
    
    i.e. one or more drives can be added and the array will re-stripe
    while on-line.
    
    Most of the interesting work was already done for raid5.  This just extends it
    to raid6.
    
    mdadm newer than 2.6 is needed for complete safety, however any version of
    mdadm which support raid5 reshape will do a good enough job in almost all
    cases (an 'echo repair > /sys/block/mdX/md/sync_action' is recommended after a
    reshape that was aborted and had to be restarted with an such a version of
    mdadm).

    [PATCH] md: restart a (raid5) reshape that has been aborted due to a read/write error
    
    An error always aborts any resync/recovery/reshape on the understanding that
    it will immediately be restarted if that still makes sense.  However a reshape
    currently doesn't get restarted.  With this patch it does.
    
    To avoid restarting when it is not possible to do work, we call into the
    personality to check that a reshape is ok, and strengthen raid5_check_reshape
    to fail if there are too many failed devices.
    
    We also break some code out into a separate function: remove_and_add_spares as
    the indent level for that code was getting crazy.

    [PATCH] md: move warning about creating a raid array on partitions of the one device
    
    md tries to warn the user if they e.g.  create a raid1 using two partitions of
    the same device, as this does not provide true redundancy.
    
    However it also warns if a raid0 is created like this, and there is nothing
    wrong with that.
    
    At the place where the warning is currently printer, we don't necessarily know
    what level the array will be, so move the warning from the point where the
    device is added to the point where the array is started.

    [PATCH] md: fix raid10 recovery problem.
    
    There are two errors that can lead to recovery problems with raid10
    when used in 'far' more (not the default).
    
    Due to a '>' instead of '>=' the wrong block is located which would result in
    garbage being written to some random location, quite possible outside the
    range of the device, causing the newly reconstructed device to fail.
    
    The device size calculation had some rounding errors (it didn't round when it
    should) and so recovery would go a few blocks too far which would again cause
    a write to a random block address and probably a device error.
    
    The code for working with device sizes was fairly confused and spread out, so
    this has been tided up a bit.

    IB/ehca: Fix sync between completion handler and destroy cq
    
    This patch fixes two issues reported by Roland Dreier and Christoph Hellwig:
    
    - Mismatched sync/locking between completion handler and destroy cq We
      introduced a counter nr_events per cq to track number of irq events
      seen. This counter is incremented when an event queue entry is seen
      and decremented after completion handler has been called regardless
      if scaling code is active or not. Note that nr_callbacks tracks
      number of events assigned to a cpu and both counters can potentially
      diverge.
    
      The sync between running completion handler and destroy cq is done
      by using the global spin lock ehca_cq_idr_lock.
    
    - Replace yield by wait_event on the counter above to become zero.

    HID: fix Logitech DiNovo Edge touchwheel and Logic3 /SpectraVideo middle button
    
    Dongle shipped with Logitech DiNovo Edge (0x046d/0xc714) behaves in a weird
    non-standard way - it contains multiple reports with the same usage, which
    results in remapping of GenericDesktop.X and GenericDesktop.Y usages to
    GenericDesktop.Z and GenericDesktop.RX respectively, thus rendering the
    touchwheel unusable.
    
    The commit 35068976916fdef82d6e69ef1f8c9a1c47732759 solved this
    in a way that it didn't remap certain usages. This however breaks
    (at least) middle button of Logic3 / SpectraVideo (0x1267/0x0210),
    which in contrary requires the remapping.
    
    To make both of the harware work, allow remapping of these usages again,
    and introduce a quirk for Logitech DiNovo Edge "touchwheel" instead - we
    disable remapping for key, abs and rel events only for this hardware.

    HID: fix broken Logitech S510 keyboard report descriptor; make extra keys work
    
    This patch makes extra keys (F1-F12 in special mode, zooming, rotate, shuffle)
    on Logitech S510 keyboard work.
    
    Logitech S510 keyboard sends in report no. 3 keys which are far above the
    logical maximum described in descriptor for given report.
    
    This patch introduces a HID quirk for this wireless USB receiver/keyboard
    in order to fix the report descriptor before it's being parsed - the logical
    maximum and the number of usages is bumped up to 0x104d). The values are in the
    "Reserved" area of consumer HUT, so HID_MAX_USAGE had to be changed too.
    
    In addition to proper extracting of  the values from report descriptor, proper
    HID-input mapping is introduced for them.

    ACPI: Altix: reinitialize acpi tables
    
    To provide compatibilty with SN kernels that do and do not
    have ACPI IO support, the SN PROM must build different
    versions of some ACPI tables based on which kernel is booting.
    As such, the tables may have to change at kernel boot time.
    By default, prior to kernel boot, the PROM builds an empty
    DSDT (header only) and no SSDTs. If an ACPI capable kernel
    boots, the kernel will notify the PROM, at platform setup time,
    and the PROM will build full DSDT and SSDT tables.
    
    With the latest changes to acpi_table_init(), the table lengths
    are saved, and when our PROM changes them, the changes are not seen,
    and the kernel will crash on boot. Because of issues with kexec support,
    we are not able to create the tables prior to acpi_table_init().
    As a result, we are making a second call to acpi_table_init() to
    process the rebuilt DSDT and SSDTs.

    with the result of gfp_any() for the gfp flags, which are passed

    context and returns GFP_KERNEL, resulting in this warning:

    [PATCH] x86_64/i386 irq: Fix !CONFIG_SMP compilation
    
    When removing set_native_irq I missed the fact that it was
    called in a couple of places that were compiled even when
    SMP support is disabled.  And since the irq_desc[].affinity
    field only exists in SMP things broke.
    
    Thanks to Simon Arlott <simon@arlott.org> for spotting this.
    
    There are a couple of ways to fix this but the simplest one
    is to just remove the assignments.  The affinity field is only
    used to display a value to the user, and nothing on either i386
    or x86_64 reads it or depends on it being any particlua value,
    so skipping the assignment is safe.  The assignment that
    is being removed is just for the initial affinity value before
    the user explicitly sets it.  The irq_desc array initializes
    this field to CPU_MASK_ALL so the field is initialized to
    a reasonable value in the SMP case without being set.

    [SPARC64]: Fix PCI interrupts on E450 et al.
    
    When the PCI controller OBP node lacks an interrupt-map
    and interrupt-map-mask property, we need to form the
    INO by hand.  The PCI swizzle logic was not doing that
    properly.
    
    This was a regression added by the of_device code.

    the driver compile for me, although I have no hardware and hence no

    qla3xxx: Kernic Panic on pSeries under stress conditions
    
    To reproduce this panic consistently, we run an intensive network

    you will see a stack trace and a kernel panic where we are calling
    pci_unmap_single() in ql_poll().
    
    Changes:
    1)  Check the flags on the Response MAC IO Control block to check for
    errors
    2)  Ensure that if we are on the 4022 we only use one segment
    3)  Before, we were reading the memory mapped producer index register
    everytime we iterated in the loop when clearing the queue.  We should
    only be iterating to a known point, not as the producer index
    is being updated.

    To reproduce this panic consistently, we run an intensive network

    After waiting for a couple of seconds, you will see a tx reset has occured.
    
    Reason:
    We enable interrupts even if we were not running.
    
    Solution:
    Now we will enable interrupts only after we are ready to give up the poll
    routine.

    qla3xxx: Remove API to change MTU.
    
    This network device driver shares the same hardware as the qla4xxx
    iSCSI driver. Changing the MTU via the device interface will
    cause qla4xxx to crash as there is no way to make notification.
    Users wishing to change the MTU must do so using an iSCSI
    utility such as Qlogic SanSurfer. This forces the user to

    qla3xxx: Remove unnecessary memset() in qla3xxx_send()
    
    We do not need to zero out the 64 byte MAC request I/O control block.
      By zeroing out the control block and setting it to proper fields is
    redundant work.  This is because in the qla3xxx_send() function we will
    already set the proper fields in this structure.  The unused fields are
    not looked at by the hardware and do not need to be zeroed out.

    qla3xxx: Return proper error codes when the 4022/4032 is being probed
    
    The return code was not properly set when when allocating memory or mapping
    memory failed.  Depending on the stack, the return code would sometimes
    return 0, which indicates everything was ok, when in fact there was an error.
      This would cause trouble when the module was removed.  Now, we will pass
    back the proper return code when an error occurs during the PCI probe.

    It looks like the skge driver inherited another bug from the sk98lin code.
    If I send from 1000mbit port to a machine on 100mbit port, the switch should
    be doing hardware flow control, but no pause frames show up in the statistics.
    
    This is the analog of the recent sky2 fixes. The device needs to listen
    for multicast pause frames and then not discard them.

    sungem_phy: support bcm5461 phy, autoneg.
    
    This version moves the medium variable to the card specific structure and
    changes the GMII_* to BCM54XX_* #defines.
    
    This patch adds improved version of enable_fiber for both the 5421 and
    the 5461 phy. It is now possible to specify with these wether you want
    autonegotiation or not. This is needed for bladecenter switches where
    some expect autonegotiation and some dont seem to like this at all.
    Depending on this flag it sets phy->autoneg accordingly for the fiber mode.
    
    More importantly it implements proper read_link and poll_link functions
    for both phys which can handle both copper and fiber mode by determining
    the medium first and then branching to the required functions. For fiber
    they all work fine, for copper they are not tested but return the result
    of the genmii_* function anyway which is supposed to work.
    
    The patch moves the genmii_* functions around to avoid foreward declarations.

    This reverts commit aeeddc1435c37fa3fc844f31d39c185b08de4158, which was
    half-baked and broken.  It just resulted in compile errors, since
    cpufreq_register_driver() still changes the 'driver_data' by setting
    bits in the flags field.  So claiming it is 'const' _really_ doesn't
    work.

    If path_rec_completion() is passed a non-NULL path record pointer
    along with an unsuccessful status value, the tracing code incorrectly
    prints the (invalid) DLID from the path record rather than the more
    interesting status code.  The actual logic of the function correctly

    [PATCH] x86: add -freg-struct-return to CFLAGS
    
    Jeremy Fitzhardinge suggested the use of -freg-struct-return, which does
    structure-returns (such as when using pte_t) in registers instead of on
    the stack.
    
    that is indeed so, and this option reduced the kernel size a bit:
    
        text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
     4799506  543456 3760128 9103090  8ae6f2 vmlinux.before

    [XFRM]: Fix oops in xfrm4_dst_destroy()
    
    With 2.6.21-rc1, I get an oops when running 'ifdown eth0' and an IPsec
    connection is active. If I shut down the connection before running 'ifdown
    eth0', then there's no problem.  The critical operation of this script is to
    kill dhcpd.
    
    The problem is probably caused by commit with git identifier
    4337226228e1cfc1d70ee975789c6bd070fb597c (Linus tree) "[IPSEC]: IPv4 over IPv6
    IPsec tunnel".
    
    This patch fixes that oops. I don't know the network code of the Linux
    kernel in deep, so if that fix is wrong, please change it. But please
    fix the oops. :)

    Reassign printk levels in selinux kernel code
    
    Below is a patch which demotes many printk lines to KERN_DEBUG from
    KERN_INFO.  It should help stop the spamming of logs with messages in
    which users are not interested nor is there any action that users should
    take.  It also promotes some KERN_INFO to KERN_ERR such as when there
    are improper attempts to register/unregister security modules.
    
    A similar patch was discussed a while back on list:
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=116656343500003&r=1&w=2
    This patch addresses almost all of the issues raised.  I believe the
    only advice not taken was in the demoting of messages related to
    undefined permissions and classes.

    [SCTP]: Fix connection hang/slowdown with PR-SCTP
    
    The problem that this patch corrects happens when all of the following
    conditions are satisfisfied:
     1.  PR-SCTP is used and the timeout on the chunks is set below RTO.Max.
     2.  One of the paths on a multihomed associations is brought down.
    
    In this scenario, data will expire within the rto of the initial
    transmission and will never be retransmitted.  However this data still
    fills the send buffer and is counted against the association as outstanding
    data.  This causes any new data not to be sent and retransmission to not
    happen.
    
    The fix is to discount the abandoned data from the outstanding count and
    peers rwnd estimation.  This allows new data to be sent and a retransmission
    timer restarted.  Even though this new data will most likely expire within
    the rto, the timer still counts as a strike against the transport and forces
    the FORWARD-TSN chunk to be retransmitted as well.

    [TG3]: TSO workaround fixes.
    
    1.  Add race condition check after netif_stop_queue().  tg3_tx() runs

        tg3_tso_bug().
    
    2.  Firmware TSO in 5703/5704/5705 also have the same TSO limitation,
        i.e. they cannot handle TSO headers bigger than 80 bytes.  Rename
        TG3_FL2_HW_TSO_1_BUG to TG3_FL2_TSO_BUG and set this flag on

    [PATCH] genirq: Mask irqs when migrating them.
    
    move_native_irqs tries to do the right thing when migrating irqs
    by disabling them.  However disabling them is a software logical
    thing, not a hardware thing.  This has always been a little flaky
    and after Ingo's latest round of changes it is guaranteed to not
    mask the apic.
    
    So this patch fixes move_native_irq to directly call the mask and
    unmask chip methods to guarantee that we mask the irq when we
    are migrating it.  We must do this as it is required by
    all code that call into the path.
    
    Since we don't know the masked status when IRQ_DISABLED is
    set so we will not be able to restore it.   The patch makes the code
    just give up and trying again the next time this routing is called.

    [PATCH] x86_64 irq: Safely cleanup an irq after moving it.
    
    The problem:  After moving an interrupt when is it safe to teardown
    the data structures for receiving the interrupt at the old location?
    
    With a normal pci device it is possible to issue a read to a device
    to flush all posted writes.  This does not work for the oldest ioapics
    because they are on a 3-wire apic bus which is a completely different
    data path.  For some more modern ioapics when everything is using
    front side bus delivery you can flush interrupts by simply issuing a
    read to the ioapic.  For other modern ioapics emperical testing has
    shown that this does not work.
    
    So it appears the only reliable way to know the last of the irqs from an
    ioapic have been received from before the ioapic was reprogrammed is to
    received the first irq from the ioapic from after it was reprogrammed.
    
    Once we know the last irq message has been received from an ioapic
    into a local apic we then need to know that irq message has been
    processed through the local apics.

    [PATCH] x86_64 irq: Simplify assign_irq_vector's arguments.
    
    Currently assign_irq_vector works mostly by side effect and returns
    the results of it's changes to the caller.  Which makes for a lot of
    arguments to pass/return and confusion as to what to do if you need
    the status but you aren't calling assign_irq_vector.
    
    This patch stops returning values from assign_irq_vector that can be
    retrieved just as easily by examining irq_cfg, and modifies the
    callers to retrive those values from irq_cfg when they need them.

    [PATCH] x86_64 irq: Begin consolidating per_irq data in structures.
    
    Currently the io_apic.c has several parallel arrays for different
    kinds of data that can be know about an irq.  The parallel arrays
    make the code harder to maintain and make it difficult to remove
    the static limits on the number of the number of irqs.
    
    This patch pushes irq_data and irq_vector into a irq_cfg array and
    updates the code to use it.

    [PATCH] x86_64 irq: Refactor setup_IO_APIC_irq
    
    Currently we have two routines that do practically the same thing
    setup_IO_APIC_irq and io_apic_set_pci_routing.  This patch makes
    setup_IO_APIC_irq the common factor of these two previous routines.
    For setup_IO_APIC_irq all that was needed was to pass the trigger
    and polarity to make the code a proper subset of io_apic_set_pci_routing.
    
    Hopefully consolidating these two routines will improve maintenance
    there were several differences that simply appear to be one routine
    or the other getting it wrong.

    wrong for the 50xx series.  Luckily both generations shared the per-port
    interrupt mask bits, leaving only the "misc chip features" bits to be
    completely mismatched.
    
    Fix 50xx by ensuring we only program bits that exist.

    [libata] sata_mv: don't touch reserved bits in EDMA config register
    
    The code in mv_edma_cfg() reflected its 60xx origins, by doing things
    [slightly] incorrectly on the older 50xx and newer 6042/7042 chips.
    
    Clean up the EDMA configuration setup such that, each chip family
    carefully initializes its own EDMA setup.

    Manuel Lass reports:
    > This bug is also present in 2.6.21-rc1, and this patch
    > indeed fixes it.
    
    The change to the devres layer re-orders the execution of cleanup
    functions and in turn causes the pcmcia layer to oops as it zaps a
    pointer now needed later on. We simply leave the pointer alone.

    sata_promise: simplify port setup
    
    Each place in pdc_ata_init_one() that initialises a SATA
    port first calls pdc_ata_setup_port(), and then manually
    assigns the port's ->scr_addr. Simplify the code by extending
    pdc_ata_setup_port() to also handle scr_addr initialisation;
    for PATA ports we pass NULL as scr_addr.
    
    The initialisation of the PATA-only 20619 redundantly set
    up scr_addr for the ports. Remove this.
    
    Tested on 20619, 20575, and 20775 chips.

    Since commit 2552fc27ff79b10b9678d92bcaef21df38bb7bb6 XIP kernels failed
    to boot because (_end - PAGE_OFFSET - 1) is much smaller than the size
    of the kernel text and data in the XIP case, causing the kernel not to
    be entirely mapped.
    
    Even in the non-XIP case, the use of (_end - PAGE_OFFSET - 1) is wrong
    because it produces a too large value if TEXT_OFFSET is larger than 1MB.
    
    Finally the original code was performing one loop too many.
    
    Let's break the loop when the section pointer has passed the last byte
    of the kernel instead.

    sata_vsc: refactor vsc_sata_interrupt and hook up error handling
    
    Separate sata_vsc interrupt handling into a normal (per-port) path and an
    error path with the addition of vsc_port_intr and vsc_error_intr
    respectively.  The error path handles interrupt based
    hotplug events which requires the definition of vsc_freeze and vsc_thaw.
    
    Note: vsc_port_intr has a workaround for unexpected interrupts that occur
    during polled commands.  This fixes a regression between 2.6.19 and 2.6.20.
    
    Changes in take2:
    * removed definition of invalid fis bit
    * let standard ata-error-handling handle the serror register
    * clear all unhandled interrupts
    * revert changes to vsc_intr_mask_update (vsc_thaw enables all interrupts)
    * use unlikely() for the pci-abort and not-our-interrupt cases in vsc_sata_interrupt
    
    Changes in take3:
    * Unify the "add" + "hook-up" patches into this single patch

    sata_sil: ignore and clear spurious IRQs while executing commands by polling
    
    sata_sil used to trigger HSM error if IRQ occurs during polling
    command.  This didn't matter because polling wasn't used in sata_sil.
    However, as of 2.6.20, all IDENTIFYs are performed by polling and
    device detection sometimes fails due to spurious IRQ.  This patch
    makes sata_sil ignore and clear spurious IRQ while executing commands

    UHCI: Eliminate asynchronous skeleton Queue Headers
    
    This patch (as856) attempts to improve the performance of uhci-hcd by
    removing the asynchronous skeleton Queue Headers.  They don't contain
    any useful information but the controller has to read through them at
    least once every millisecond, incurring a non-zero DMA overhead.
    
    Now all the asynchronous queues are combined, along with the period-1
    interrupt queue, into a single list with a single skeleton QH.  The
    start of the low-speed control, full-speed control, and bulk sublists
    is determined by linear search.  Since there should rarely be more
    than a couple of QHs in the list, the searches should incur a much
    smaller total load than keeping the skeleton QHs.

    It turns out that we end up with a loop trying to load the unix

    Reordering the fields in struct pm_ops not only makes the output of kernel-doc

    sysfs: move struct sysfs_dirent to private header
    
    struct sysfs_dirent is private to the fs/sysfs/ subtree.  It is
    not even referenced as an opaque structure outside of that subtree.
    
    The following patch moves the declaration from include/linux/sysfs.h to
    fs/sysfs/sysfs.h, making it clearer that nothing else in the kernel
    dereferences it.

    sata_nv: kill old private BMDMA helper functions
    
    sata_nv implemented its own copies of the BMDMA helper functions for ADMA,
    since the ADMA BMDMA status registers are PIO while the other registers
    are MMIO, and this was the only way to handle this previously. Now that
    we have iomap support, the standard routines should just work, so use them.
    The only thing we need to override as far as ADMA and BMDMA is the
    post_internal_cmd callback, where we should only call ata_post_internal_cmd
    if we are in port-register mode.

    ahci: consider SDB FIS containing spurious NCQ completions HSM violation (regenerated)
    
    SDB FIS containing spurious NCQ completions is a clear protocol
    violation.  Currently, only some Maxtors with early firmware revisions
    are showing this problem.  Those firmwares have other NCQ related
    problems including buggy NCQ error reporting and occasional lock up
    after NCQ errors.
    
    Consider spurious NCQ completions HSM violation and freeze the port
    after it.  EH will turn off NCQ after this happens several times.
    Eventually drives which show this behavior should be blacklisted for
    NCQ.

    IB/uverbs: Return correct error for invalid PD in register MR
    
    If no matching PD is found in ib_uverbs_reg_mr(), then the function
    jumps to err_release without setting the return value ret.  This means
    that ret will hold the return value of the call to ib_umem_get() a few
    lines earlier; if the function reaches the point where it looks for
    the PD, we know that ib_umem_get() must have returned 0, so
    ib_uverbs_reg_mr() ends up return 0 for a bad PD ID.  Fix this by
    setting ret to -EINVAL before jumping to the exit path when no PD is
    found.

    [MIPS] Add basic SMARTMIPS ASE support
    
    This patch adds trivial support for SMARTMIPS extension. This extension
    is currently implemented by 4KS[CD] CPUs.
    
    Basically it saves/restores ACX register, which is part of the SMARTMIPS
    ASE, when needed. This patch does *not* add any support for Smartmips MMU
    features.
    
    Futhermore this patch does not add explicit support for 4KS[CD] CPUs since
    they are respectively mips32 and mips32r2 compliant.  So with the current
    processor configuration, a platform that has such CPUs needs to select
    both configs:
    
    	CPU_HAS_SMARTMIPS
    	SYS_HAS_CPU_MIPS32_R[12]
    
    This is due to the processor configuration which is mixing up all the
    architecture variants and the processor types.
    
    The drawback of this, is that we currently pass '-march=mips32' option to
    gcc when building a kernel instead of '-march=4ksc' for 4KSC case. This
    can lead to a kernel image a little bit bigger than required.

    This reverts commit d2ed16356ff4fb9de23fbc5e5d582ce580390106.
    
    As Thomas Gleixner reports:
      "e1000 is not working anymore. ifup fails permanentely.
        ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): eth0: link is not ready
       nothing else"
    
    The broken commit was identified with "git bisect".
    
    Auke Kok says:
      "I think we need to drop this now.  The report that says that this
       *fixes* something might have been on regular interrupts only.  I
       currently suspect that it breaks all MSI interrupts, which would make
       sense if I look a the code.  Very bad indeed."

    V4L/DVB (5246): Budget-ci: IR handling fixups
    
    Commit 00c4cc67512ada1d195b8bf3ef1db1d6b3951605 Oliver Endriss changed
    the budget-ci driver to use interrupt mode for i2c transfers.
    
    This also meant that a new bunch of IR bytes that were previously lost
    are now received, which allowed me to better understand how the MSP430
    chip works. Unfortunately it also means that the current driver gets
    some assumptions wrong and might generate double keypresses for one IR
    command.
    
    The attached patch fixes this by throwing away the repeat bytes and by
    associating the correct command and device bytes.

    V4L/DVB (5178): Avoid race when deregistering the IR control for dvb-usb

    and the last piece of work it does is:

    Tested successfully with au6610 and gl861 devices against fi-Yllas

    There is a "hack" to enable probable i2c gate in zl10535
    demodulator. QT1010 doesn't respond to any i2c messages before we
    write 0x1a to demodulator register 0x62. In my understanding this
    should be fixed to demodulator code.

    V4L/DVB (5236): Initial support for Sigmatek DVB-110 DVB-T
    
    This patch adds driver for Sigmatek DVB-110 USB DVB-T stick. Stick has based
    on hardware of Qtuantek QT1010 tuner, Zarlink ZL10353 (Intel CE 6353)
    demodulator and Alcor Micro AU6610 DVB-T USB controller. HW is rather similar
    as used in MSI Megasky GL861.
    Currently, the driver works only in USB 2.0. In my understanding USB 1.1 is
    also supported by hw but I cannot test it due to lack of USB 1.1 port. Device
    supports only isochronous mode transfers. There is also eeprom in usb
    controller(at least in address range 0x80 - 0xbf) for storing data, eg.
    firmware. Anyway, firmware loading is not used / required by the device.
    There seems to be at least one unknown I2C device in address 0xa0, probably
    remote control or GPIO. Windows drivers reads registers from 0x00 to 0x07
    from this unknown address.
    Driver is based on gl861 module. Tuner has a lot of problems to lock with
    megasky qt1010 module with this hardware with some broadcasting standards.

    V4L/DVB (5221): Dvb-usb: initial support for MSI Mega Sky 580 DVB-T based on GL861
    
    This patch adds support for MSI Mega Sky 580 / GL861 DVB-T USB2.0
    Except for the 2 lines added to zl10353.c, zl10353_reset_attach needs
    to be changed. If I read the code correctly setting parallel_ts will
    take care of the 3rd byte, but the 2nd byte needs to be 0x0b instead
    of 0x03 too. I guess these changes needs to be done only for this
    device, not sure how to do that.
    The zl10353 changes have been split apart from this patch, into the next
    patch, soon to follow.

    possible to find cx23416 firmware whose size doesn't conform to this

    forgiving of the image size.

    if the conversion process is fine with the v4l-dvb maintainers, it should not

    V4L/DVB (5181): Sliced VBI API no longer marked experimental.
    
    The Sliced VBI API is no longer marked experimental. Introduced in 2.6.14
    and with only a single modification in 2.6.19 I think we can consider this
    API to be solid.

    V4L/DVB (5166): Remove obsolete alias defines of CONFIG_* settings
    
    The out of tree v4l-dvb build system didn't always override the kernel's
    configuration settings with v4l-dvb's settings correctly.  To work around
    this, makefiles would define some new macro based on the setting of a
    config variable.  e.g. the pwc Makefile would define CONFIG_PWC_DEBUG if
    CONFIG_USB_PWC_DEBUG (which is defined via Kconfig) was set.
    The v4l-dvb build system should now always override correctly, and this
    is no longer necessary.  This patch gets ride of these extra defines and
    just uses the CONFIG_* settings directly.

    V4L/DVB (5164): Compat: Handle input_register_device() change and some others
    
    input_register_device() was changed to return an error code instead of
    being void in 2.6.15.  Handle it with a macro wrapper in config.h.  For
    this to work, linux/input.h must be included before config.h.  This
    required some trivial header re-ordering in budget-ci.c and ttusb_dec.c.
    In kernel 2.6.15-rc1 a helper function called setup_timer() was added to
    linux/timer.h.  Add to compat.h, but require that linux/timer.h be
    included first to give the definition of struct timer_list.
    A new 4GB DMA zone, __GFP_DMA32, was added in 2.6.15-rc2.  Alias it to
    __GFP_DMA on older kernels.
    Handle another 2.6.15 "input_dev->dev to input_dev->cdev.dev" change for
    some recently added code in cinergyT2.c.

    V4L/DVB (5147): Make vivi driver to use vmalloced pointers
    
    Before this patch, vivi were simulating a scatter gather DMA transfer.
    While this is academic, showing how stuff really works on a real PCI
    device, this means a non-optimized code.
    There are only two memory models that vivi implements:
    	1) kernel alloced memory. This is also used by read() method.
    	   On this case, a vmalloc32 buffer is allocated at kernel;
    	2) userspace allocated memory. This is used by most userspace apps.
    	   video-buf will store this pointer.
    	   a simple copy_to_user is enough to transfer data.
    The third memory model scenario supported by video-buf is overlay mode.
    This model is not implemented on vivi and unlikely to be implemented on
    newer drivers, since now, most userspace apps do some post-processing
    (like de-interlacing).
    After this patch, some cleanups may be done at video-buf.c to avoid
    allocating pages, when the driver doesn't need a PCI buffer. This is the
    case of vivi and usb drivers.

    V4L/DVB (5146): Make VIDIOC_INT_[SG]_REGISTER ioctls no longer internal only
    
    The direct register access ioctls were defined as kernel internal only,
    but they are very useful for debugging hardware from userspace and are
    used as such.  Officially export them.
    
    VIDIOC_INT_[SG]_REGISTER is renamed to VIDIOC_DBG_[SG]_REGISTER
    Definition of ioctl and struct v4l2_register is moved from v4l2-common.h
    to videodev2.h.
    
    Types used in struct v4l2_register are changed to the userspace
    exportable versions (u32 -> __u32, etc).
    
    Use of VIDIOC_DBG_S_REGISTER requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN permission, so move
    the check into the video_ioctl2() dispatcher so it doesn't need to be
    duplicated in each driver's call-back function. CAP_SYS_ADMIN check is
    added to pvrusb2 (which doesn't use video_ioctl2).

    Using it makes the driver simpler, and isolates API parsing.
    This allows future reusage of driver controls using other ways, like sysfs

    generic common ioctl processing.

    V4L/DVB (5095): Pvrusb2: Allow VIDIOC_S_FMT with -1 for resolution values
    
    With the previous patch, mplayer started but was polling the video
    device forever without any video actually coming out. Further analysis
    showed that it does a VIDIOC_S_FMT with width and height set to -1 (!!!).
    The code handling this only cares that both are lower than the minimum
    range allowed so it ends up setting the size to 19x17 (!!) This pretty
    much breaks the encoder here. Even if this breakage is yet another (TM)
    result of my setup, setting the size to 19x17 by default would surprise
    most users IMHO.
    So, special case for -1 and interpret this to be a request for the
    default size, please. Users can then set their favorite size both
    through mplayer and through sysfs.
    With this patch, mplayer finally works in pvr:// mode (not that we
    really gain anything over operating it through sysfs with lirc,
    sometime I might actually get off my lazy a** and contribute this
    setup too)

    This should allow mplayer pvr:// to start. The trick is that no matter
    what actual input we use under this "fake" one, it will be able to do

    V4L/DVB (5093): Pvrusb2: Emit VIDIOC_S_TUNER correctly
    
    Audio mode changes are not private to the audio chip - other I2C
    modules need to see this as well.  And since the command in question
    is VIDIOC_S_TUNER which is a standard v4l2 command, we really should
    be broadcasting it out.  This change sets up a broadcast pathway for
    VIDIOC_S_TUNER and also eliminates the now redundant code from the
    audio chip handler.
    This fix enables stereo reception for the FM radio

    V4L/DVB (5077): Bttv cropping support
    
    Adds the missing VIDIOC_CROPCAP, G_CROP and S_CROP ioctls, permitting
    applications to capture or overlay a subsection of the picture or to
    extend the capture window beyond active video, into the VBI area and the
    horizontal blanking. VBI capturing can start and end on any line,
    including the picture area, and apps can capture different lines of each
    field and single fields.
    For compatibility with existing applications, the open() function
    resets the cropping and VBI capturing parameters and a VIDIOC_S_CROP
    call is necessary to actually enable cropping.
    Regrettably in PAL-M, PAL-N, PAL-Nc and NTSC-JP mode the maximum image
    width will increase from 640 and 768 to 747 and 923 pixels respectively.
    Like the VBI changes however, this should only affect applications which
    depend on former driver limitations, such as never getting more than 640
    pixels regardless of the requested width.
    Also, new freedoms require additional checks for conflicts and some
    applications may not expect an EBUSY error from the VIDIOC_QBUF and
    VIDIOCMCAPTURE ioctls. These errors should be rare though.
    So far, the patch has been tested on a UP machine with a bt878 in PAL-
    BGHI and NTSC-M mode using xawtv, tvtime, mplayer/mencoder, zapping/
    libzvbi and these tools: http://zapping.sf.net/bttv-crop-test.tar.bz2
    I'd be grateful about comments or bug reports.

    the volume so that 65535 makes sense because doing so will screw up
    any app - like MythTV - which expects the old scaling.)  Too bad V4L
    controls don't have better defined ranges.

    V4L/DVB (5039): Pvrusb2: Implement /dev/radioX
    
    The "main" V4L2 interface patch. This is yet very incomplete, incorrect and
    probably inappropriate for inclusion as-is, but at least with this I 'm able
    to tune and play radio through a V4L2 program (pvr-radio.c, a "thumb" version
    of ivtv-radio.c with just the essentials).
    
    Therefore, it kinda gives an idea of what is needed to support this, hm,
    interface (partly used also by e.g., kradio). Please point out any mistakes
    on this code. I 'm sure I 'm messing up some struct initialization somewhere
    but currently I 'm too lazy to actually think this through until I complete
    the functionality (e.g., handle the VIDIOC_S_STD, ENUMINPUT, etc ioctls
    appropriately).

    V4L/DVB (5038): Pvrusb2: Implement stream claim checking function
    
    Add (and expose) a new function, pvr2_channel_check_stream_no_lock(), in
    pvrusb2-context.c. This is hopefully the last V4L2 interface related patch
    to change anything outside pvrusb2-v4l2.c.
    
    We need this to implement the open() for the radio device. The reason is
    that within the *enter_context() section of open() we need to ensure nobody
    is streaming and if we cannot, we should cleanup after ourselves and return
     -EBUSY. We cannot just use claim_stream() because:
    
       1) That would cause a deadlock trying to re-acquire the context lock
       2) We only need to ensure that nobody is streaming. We don't need to
          actually acquire the stream.
    
    Again, this is a kinda ugly patch. Feel free to improve.

    V4L/DVB (5037): Pvrusb2: Implement multiple minor device number handling
    
    This is the first patch in preparation of the V4L2/IVTV radio interface.
    It does away with the assumption of only one minor per device. It also
    adds a file to show the radio minor as well. This can be useful for a
    program like pvr-radio.c (when it grows up), since this way it can search
    for the minor of the /dev/radioX device it opened and use the video minor
    of the same driver instance to get to the actual stream.
    
    The implementation looks kinda ugly. Feel free to improve (that is the
    reason behind separate patches anyway).

    V4L/DVB (5036): Pvrusb2: Fix for min/max control value checking
    
    In the previous patch we exploited the get_{min,max}_value facility to adjust
    min/max allowable frequencies on the fly, depending on tuner mode.
    
    Unfortunately, this facility was not used inside the *sym_to_val() function
    that translates what we echo to sysfs, which means we got an -ERANGE despite
    asking for a frequency between what we read to be min/max.
    This patch corrects this small omission.

    V4L/DVB (5035): Pvrusb2: Enable radio mode round #2
    
    This is the logic that:
      a) Ensures /sys/class/pvrusb2/sn-*/ctl_frequency/{max,min}_val are
         "automagically" reset to sane values on each mode change.
    
      b) Allows tuning to a radio frequency by something like:
         echo `perl -e "print int(94.9*16000 + 0.5)"` \
           > /sys/class/pvrusb2/sn-*/ctl_input/cur_val
    
    
    The trick was to take advantage of the already existing .get_{min,max}_value
    function pointers in pvr2_ctrl, to "dynamically override" the hardcoded values
    for min/max frequency at runtime.
    
    For a moment I thought to dispose of the hardcoded MIN/MAX_FREQ and use the
    hirange/lowrange fields of the v4l2_tuner struct instead, but then I see that
    tuner-core.c kinda hardcodes these as well, so I decided to not bother.

    V4L/DVB (5034): Pvrusb2: Enable radio mode round #1
    
    This is the logic that supports switching modes via e.g.,
      echo radio > /sys/class/pvrusb2/sn-*/ctl_input/cur_val.
    
    To do the mode switching we need to:
    a) broadcast AUDC_SET_RADIO and
    b) issue the CX2341X_ENC_MUTE_VIDEO command to the encoder.
    
    The first is done by adding a new pvr2_i2c_op and having it trigger on
    input change, the second by adding this command in pvr2_encoder_start()
    and requesting an encoder restart on input change by setting
    stale_subsys_mask appropriately.
    
    The clues about AUDC_SET_RADIO and CX2341X_ENC_MUTE_VIDEO were kindly
    provided by Hans Verkuil on the pvrusb2 mailing list. The idea to
    implement mode switching this way (on input change) is due to Mike Isely.
    
    Why AUDC_SET_RADIO/VIDIOC_S_STD are used for switching? I can 't be sure,
    but I think this can be traced to a cornell student being the first to
    implement radio support in ivtv "as a different standard". I think the
    rest just evolved from there (it 's in the ivtv ML archives).

    libata: s/ap->id/ap->print_id/g
    
    ata_port has two different id fields - id and port_no.  id is
    system-wide 1-based unique id for the port while port_no is 0-based
    host-wide port number.  The former is primarily used to identify the
    ATA port to the user in printk messages while the latter is used in
    various places in libata core and LLDs to index the port inside the
    host.
    
    The two fields feel quite similar and sometimes ap->id is used in
    place of ap->port_no, which is very difficult to spot.  This patch
    renames ap->id to ap->print_id to reduce the possibility of such bugs.
    
    Some printk messages are adjusted such that id string (ata%u[.%u])
    isn't printed twice and/or to use ata_*_printk() instead of hardcoded
    id format.

    sata_nv: Use notifier for completion checks
    
    The hardware provides us a notifier register that indicates what command
    tags have completed. Use this to determine which CPBs to check, rather
    than blindly checking all active CPBs. This should provide a minor
    performance win, since if the controller has touched some of these
    incomplete CPBs, accessing them will likely result in a cache miss.

    libata: fix probe_ent alloc/free bugs
    
    ata_probe_ent_alloc() had a temporary hack such that devm_kzalloc()
    was used for allocation if devres had been previously initialized on
    the device; otherwise, plain kzalloc() was used.  This was to make the
    code useable from both the old and devres-aware libata drivers during
    transition.  This hack made ata_sas_port_alloc() unable to determine
    how the probe_ent is allocated, causing double free in some cases.
    
    Remove the now-unneeded hack and make ata_sas_port_alloc() use
    devm_kfree().

    libata bugfix: HDIO_DRIVE_TASK
    
    I was trying to use HDIO_DRIVE_TASK for something today,
    and discovered that the libata implementation does not copy
    over the upper four LBA bits from args[6].
    
    This is serious, as any tools using this ioctl would have their
    commands applied to the wrong sectors on the drive, possibly resulting
    in disk corruption.
    
    Ideally, newer apps should use SG_IO/ATA_16 directly,
    avoiding this bug.  But with libata poised to displace drivers/ide,
    better compatibility here is a must.
    
    This patch fixes libata to use the upper four LBA bits passed
    in from the ioctl.
    
    The original drivers/ide implementation copies over all bits
    except for the master/slave select bit.  With this patch,
    libata will copy only the four high-order LBA bits,
    just in case there are assumptions elsewhere in libata (?).

    libata: put some intelligence into EH speed down sequence
    
    The current EH speed down code is more of a proof that the EH
    framework is capable of adjusting transfer speed in response to error.
    This patch puts some intelligence into EH speed down sequence.  The
    rules are..
    
    * If there have been more than three timeout, HSM violation or
      unclassified DEV errors for known supported commands during last 10
      mins, NCQ is turned off.
    
    * If there have been more than three timeout or HSM violation for known
      supported command, transfer mode is slowed down.  If DMA is active,
      it is first slowered by one grade (e.g. UDMA133->100).  If that
      doesn't help, it's slowered to 40c limit (UDMA33).  If PIO is
      active, it's slowered by one grade first.  If that doesn't help,
      PIO0 is forced.  Note that this rule does not change transfer mode.
      DMA is never degraded into PIO by this rule.
    
    * If there have been more than ten ATA bus, timeout, HSM violation or
      unclassified device errors for known supported commands && speeding
      down DMA mode didn't help, the device is forced into PIO mode.  Note
      that this rule is considered only for PATA devices and is pretty
      difficult to trigger.
    
    One error can only trigger one rule at a time.  After a rule is
    triggered, error history is cleared such that the next speed down
    happens only after some number of errors are accumulated.  This makes
    sense because now speed down is done in bigger stride.

    libata: improve probe failure handling
    
    * Move forcing device to PIO0 on device disable into
      ata_dev_disable().  This makes both old and new EHs act the same
      way.
    
    * Speed down only PIO mode on probe failure.  All commands used during
      probing are PIO commands.  There's no point in speeding down DMA.
    
    * Retry at least once after -ENODEV.  Some devices report garbled
      IDENTIFY data after certain events.  This shouldn't cause device
      detach and re-attach.
    
    * Rearrange EH failure path for simplicity.

    libata: improve ata_down_xfermask_limit()
    
    Make ata_down_xfermask_limit() accept @sel instead of @force_pio0.
    @sel selects how the xfermask limit will be adjusted.  The following
    selectors are defined.
    
    * ATA_DNXFER_PIO	: only speed down PIO
    * ATA_DNXFER_DMA	: only speed down DMA, don't cause transfer mode change
    * ATA_DNXFER_40C	: apply 40c cable limit
    * ATA_DNXFER_FORCE_PIO	: force PIO
    * ATA_DNXFER_FORCE_PIO0	: force PIO0 (same as original with @force_pio0 == 1)
    * ATA_DNXFER_ANY	: same as original with @force_pio0 == 0
    
    Currently, only ANY and FORCE_PIO0 are used to maintain the original
    behavior.  Other selectors will be used later to improve EH speed down
    sequence.

    This is the patch for PATA controller of Celleb.
    
    This driver uses the managed iomap (devres).
    
    Because this driver needs special taskfile accesses, there is
    a copy of ata_std_softreset(). ata_dev_try_classify() is exported
    so that it can be used in this function.

    [PATCH] remove modpost false warnings on ARM
    
    This patch stops "modpost" from issuing erroneous modpost warnings on ARM
    builds, which it's been doing since since maybe last summer.  A canonical
    example would be driver method table entries:
    
      WARNING: <path> - Section mismatch: reference to .exit.text:<name>_remove
    	from .data after '$d' (at offset 0x4)
    
    That "$d" symbol is generated by tools conformant with ARM ABI specs; in
    this case it's a symbol **in the middle of** a "<name>_driver" struct.
    
    The erroneous warnings appear to be issued because "modpost" whitelists
    references from "<name>_driver" data into init and exit sections ...  but
    doesn't know should also include those "$d" mapping symbols, which are not
    otherwise associated with "<name>_driver" symbols.
    
    This patch prevents the modpost symbol lookup code from ever returning
    those mapping symbols, so it will return a whitelisted symbol instead.
    Then things work as expected.
    
    Now to revert various code-bloating "fixes" that got merged because of this
    modpost bug....

    Based on the discussion last december (http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/20/242),
    this patch:
    
      - moves the PXA_LAST_GPIO check into pxa_gpio_mode
      - fixes comment and includes in gpio.h
      - replaces the gpio_set/get_value macros with inline
        functions and adds a non-inline version to avoid
        code explosion when gpio is not a constant.

    [PATCH] at91_rtc updates
    
    Various bug fixes to the at91rm9200 RTC:
    
     - alarm:  setalarm() should pay attention to the "enabled" flag
    
     - init:  cleaner handling of the wakeup flags, which cpu init should
       really have set up.  Doing it here is just a workaround.
    
     - linkage:  since the at91_rtc driver probe() routine is in the init
       section, it should use platform_driver_probe() instead of leaving
       that pointer around in the driver struct after init section removal.
    
     - linkage:  likewise, remove() belongs in the exit section.
    
    Among other things, the init and alarm changes ensure that this driver
    handles the new sysfs "wakealarm" attribute properly.

    [PATCH] rtc-sa1100 rtc_wklarm.enabled bugfixes
    
    Some rtc-sa1100 bugfixes:
    
     - The read_alarm() method reports the rtc_wkalrm.enabled field properly.
       This patch is already in the handhelds.org tree.
    
     - And the set_alarm() method now handles that flag correctly, rather than
       making mismatched {en,dis}able_irq_wake() calls, which trigger runtime
       warning messages.  (Those calls are best made in suspend/resume methods.)
    
    Note that while this SA1100/PXA RTC is fully capable of waking those ARM
    processors from sleep states, that mechanism isn't properly supported on
    either processor family, or in this driver.  Some boards have board-specific
    PM glue providing partial workarounds for the weak generic PM support.

    [PATCH] autofs4: check for directory re-create in lookup
    
    This problem was identified and fixed some time ago by Jeff Moyer but it fell
    through the cracks somehow.
    
    It is possible that a user space application could remove and re-create a
    directory during a request.  To avoid returning a failure from lookup
    incorrectly when our current dentry is unhashed we need to check if another
    positive, hashed dentry matching this one exists and if so return it instead
    of a fail.

    [PATCH] autofs4: fix another race between mount and expire
    
    Jeff Moyer has identified a race between mount and expire.
    
    What happens is that during an expire the situation can arise that a directory
    is removed and another lookup is done before the expire issues a completion
    status to the kernel module.  In this case, since the the lookup gets a new
    dentry, it doesn't know that there is an expire in progress and when it posts
    its mount request, matches the existing expire request and waits for its
    completion.  ENOENT is then returned to user space from lookup (as the dentry
    passed in is now unhashed) without having performed the mount request.
    
    The solution used here is to keep track of dentrys in this unhashed state and
    reuse them, if possible, in order to preserve the flags.  Additionally, this
    infrastructure will provide the framework for the reintroduction of caching of
    mount fails removed earlier in development.

    [PATCH] fs: fix nobh data leak
    
    nobh_prepare_write leaks data similarly to how simple_prepare_write did. Fix
    by not marking the page uptodate until nobh_commit_write time. Again, this
    could break weird use-cases, but none appear to exist in the tree.
    
    We can safely remove the set_page_dirty, because as the comment says,
    nobh_commit_write does set_page_dirty. If a filesystem wants to allocate
    backing store for a page dirtied via mmap, page_mkwrite is the suggested
    approach.

    [PATCH] fs: fix libfs data leak
    
    simple_prepare_write leaks uninitialised kernel data.  This happens because
    the it leaves an uninitialised "hole" over the part of the page that the
    write is expected to go to.  This is fine, but it then marks the page
    uptodate, which means a concurrent read can come in and copy the
    uninitialised memory into userspace before it written to.
    
    Fix it by simply marking it uptodate in simple_commit_write instead, after
    the hole has been filled in.  This could theoretically break an fs that
    uses simple_prepare_write and not simple_commit_write, and that relies on
    the incorrect simple_prepare_write behaviour.  Luckily, none of those
    exists in the tree.

    The problem comes when ks0108/cfag12864b are built-in and no parallel port is

    (as there is no parallel port to use).

    ks0108 failed, and calls ks0108_writecontrol(), which dereferences an
    uninitialized pointer.
    
    Init order is OK, I think.  The problem is how to stop cfag12864b_init() being
    called if ks0108 failed to load.  modprobe does it for us, but, how when
    built-in?

    [PATCH] fault injection: split up stacktrace filter Kconfig option
    
    There is no prompt for CONFIG_STACKTRACE, so FAULT_INJECTION cannot be
    selected without LOCKDEP enabled.  (found by Paolo 'Blaisorblade'
    Giarrusso)
    
    In order to fix such broken Kconfig dependency, this patch splits up the
    stacktrace filter support for fault injection by new Kconfig option, which
    enables to use fault injection on the architecture which doesn't have
    general stacktrace support.

    Andrew noticed that unlocking the page before submitting all buffers for

    messing around with the page buffers, and they subsequently get freed.

    [PATCH] shm: make sysv ipc shared memory use stacked files
    
    The current ipc shared memory code runs into several problems because it
    does not quite use files like the rest of the kernel.  With the option of
    backing ipc shared memory with either hugetlbfs or ordinary shared memory
    the problems got worse.  With the added support for ipc namespaces things
    behaved so unexpected that we now have several bad namespace reference
    counting bugs when using what appears at first glance to be a reasonable
    idiom.
    
    So to attack these problems and hopefully make the code more maintainable
    this patch simply uses the files provided by other parts of the kernel and
    builds it's own files out of them.  The shm files are allocated in do_shmat
    and freed when their reference count drops to zero with their last unmap.
    The file and vm operations that we don't want to implement or we don't
    implement completely we just delegate to the operations of our backing
    file.
    
    This means that we now get an accurate shm_nattch count for we have a
    hugetlbfs inode for backing store, and the shm accounting of last attach
    and last detach time work as well.
    
    This means that getting a reference to the ipc namespace when we create the
    file and dropping the referenece in the release method is now safe and
    correct.
    
    This means we no longer need a special case for clearing VM_MAYWRITE
    as our file descriptor now only has write permissions when we have
    requested write access when calling shmat.  Although VM_SHARED is now
    cleared as well which I believe is harmless and is mostly likely a
    minor bug fix.
    
    By using the same set of operations for both the hugetlb case and regular
    shared memory case shmdt is not simplified and made slightly more correct
    as now the test "vma->vm_ops == &shm_vm_ops" is 100% accurate in spotting
    all shared memory regions generated from sysvipc shared memory.

    [PATCH] slab: reduce size of alien cache to cover only possible nodes
    
    The alien cache is a per cpu per node array allocated for every slab on the
    system.  Currently we size this array for all nodes that the kernel does
    support.  For IA64 this is 1024 nodes.  So we allocate an array with 1024
    objects even if we only boot a system with 4 nodes.
    
    This patch uses "nr_node_ids" to determine the number of possible nodes
    supported by a hardware configuration and only allocates an alien cache
    sized for possible nodes.
    
    The initialization of nr_node_ids occurred too late relative to the bootstrap
    of the slab allocator and so I moved the setup_nr_node_ids() into
    free_area_init_nodes().

    [PATCH] Convert highest_possible_processor_id to nr_cpu_ids
    
    We frequently need the maximum number of possible processors in order to
    allocate arrays for all processors.  So far this was done using
    highest_possible_processor_id().  However, we do need the number of
    processors not the highest id.  Moreover the number was so far dynamically
    calculated on each invokation.  The number of possible processors does not
    change when the system is running.  We can therefore calculate that number
    once.

    [PATCH] Replace highest_possible_node_id() with nr_node_ids
    
    highest_possible_node_id() is currently used to calculate the last possible
    node idso that the network subsystem can figure out how to size per node
    arrays.
    
    I think having the ability to determine the maximum amount of nodes in a
    system at runtime is useful but then we should name this entry
    correspondingly, it should return the number of node_ids, and the the value
    needs to be setup only once on bootup.  The node_possible_map does not
    change after bootup.
    
    This patch introduces nr_node_ids and replaces the use of
    highest_possible_node_id().  nr_node_ids is calculated on bootup when the
    page allocators pagesets are initialized.

    rdmsr_on_cpu, wrmsr_on_cpu
    
    There was OpenVZ specific bug rendering some cpufreq drivers unusable on SMP.
    In short, when cpufreq code thinks it confined itself to needed cpu by means
    of set_cpus_allowed() to execute rdmsr, some "virtual cpu" feature can migrate
    process to anywhere.  This triggers bugons and does wrong things in general.
    
    This got fixed by introducing rdmsr_on_cpu and wrmsr_on_cpu executing rdmsr
    and wrmsr on given physical cpu by means of smp_call_function_single().
    
    Dave Jones mentioned cpufreq might be not only user of rdmsr_on_cpu() and
    wrmsr_on_cpu(), so I'm putting them into arch/{i386,x86_64}/lib/ .

    natsemi: Add support for using MII port with no PHY
    
    This patch provides code paths which allow the natsemi driver to use the
    external MII port on the chip but ignore any PHYs that may be attached to it.
    The link state will be left as it was when the driver started and can be
    configured via ethtool.  Any PHYs that are present can be accessed via the MII
    ioctl()s.
    
    This is useful for systems where the device is connected without a PHY
    or where either information or actions outside the scope of the driver
    are required in order to use the PHYs.

    and handling the flush_scheduled_work on removal. This work queue is only
    ever used for the old fiber based boards.

    flush_scheduled_work() in net_device->close has a slight tendency

    rtl8169_close/down simply need the recovery tasks to not meddle
    with the hardware while the device is going down.

    backlight: Separate backlight properties from backlight ops pointers
    
    Per device data such as brightness belongs to the indivdual device
    and should therefore be separate from the the backlight operation
    function pointers. This patch splits the two types of data and
    allows simplifcation of some code.

    backlight: Rework backlight/fb interaction simplifying, lots
    
    fb_info->bl_mutex is badly thought out and the backlight class doesn't
    need it if the framebuffer/backlight register/unregister order is
    consistent, particularly after the backlight locking fixes.
    
    Fix the drivers to use the order:
    
    backlight_device_register()
    register_framebuffer()
    unregister_framebuffer()
    backlight_device_unregister()
    
    and turn bl_mutex into a lock for the bl_curve data only.

    backlight/fbcon: Add FB_EVENT_CONBLANK
    
    The backlight class wants notification whenever the console is blanked
    but doesn't get this when hardware blanking fails and software blanking
    is used. Changing FB_EVENT_BLANK to report both would be a behaviour
    change which could confuse the console layer so add a new event for
    software blanking and have the backlight class listen for both.

    backlight: Fix external uses of backlight internal semaphore
    
    backlight_device->sem has a very specific use as documented in the
    header file. The external users of this are using it for a different
    reason, to serialise access to the update_status() method.
    
    backlight users were supposed to implement their own internal
    serialisation of update_status() if needed but everyone is doing
    things differently and incorrectly. Therefore add a global mutex to
    take care of serialisation for everyone, once and for all.
    
    Locking for get_brightness remains optional since most users don't
    need it.
    
    Also update the lcd class in a similar way.

    [MIPS] Fixup copy_from_user_inatomic
    
    From the 01408c4939479ec46c15aa7ef6e2406be50eeeca log message:
    
    The problem is that when we write to a file, the copy from userspace to
    pagecache is first done with preemption disabled, so if the source
    address is not immediately available the copy fails *and* *zeros* *the*
    *destination*.
    
    This is a problem because a concurrent read (which admittedly is an odd
    thing to do) might see zeros rather that was there before the write, or
    what was there after, or some mixture of the two (any of these being a
    reasonable thing to see).
    
    If the copy did fail, it will immediately be retried with preemption
    re-enabled so any transient problem with accessing the source won't
    cause an error.
    
    The first copying does not need to zero any uncopied bytes, and doing
    so causes the problem.  It uses copy_from_user_atomic rather than
    copy_from_user so the simple expedient is to change copy_from_user_atomic
    to *not* zero out bytes on failure.
    
    < --- end cite --- >
    
    This patch finally implements at least a not so pretty solution by
    duplicating the relevant part of __copy_user.

    [MIPS] Use MIPS R2 instructions for bitops.
    
    Add R2 optimized variants of clear_bit, set_bit and test_and_clear_bit.
    With gcc 4.1.1 this saves 1592 bytes on a defconfig (minus IPv6) kernel.
    Turns out that R2 bitop instructions are no gain for the other bitop
    functions.

    [MIPS] Iomap implementation.
    
    This implementation has support for the concept of one separate ioport
    address space by PCI domain.  A pointer to the virtual address where
    the port space of a domain has been mapped has been added to struct
    pci_controller and systems should be fixed to fill in this value. For
    single domain systems this will be the same value as passed to
    set_io_port_base().

    9p: implement optional loose read cache
    
    While cacheing is generally frowned upon in the 9p world, it has its
    place -- particularly in situations where the remote file system is
    exclusive and/or read-only.  The vacfs views of venti content addressable
    store are a real-world instance of such a situation.  To facilitate higher
    performance for these workloads (and eventually use the fscache patches),
    we have enabled a "loose" cache mode which does not attempt to maintain
    any form of consistency on the page-cache or dcache.  This results in over
    two orders of magnitude performance improvement for cacheable block reads
    in the Bonnie benchmark.  The more aggressive use of the dcache also seems
    to improve metadata operational performance.

    Input: psmouse - properly reset mouse on shutdown/suspend
    
    Some people report that they need psmouse module unloaded
    for suspend to ram/disk to work properly. Let's make port
    cleanup behave the same way as driver unload.
    
    This fixes "bad state" roblem on various HP laptops, such
    as nx7400.

    [PATCH] audit config lockdown
    
    The following patch adds a new mode to the audit system. It uses the
    audit_enabled config option to introduce the idea of audit enabled, but
    configuration is immutable. Any attempt to change the configuration
    while in this mode is audited. To change the audit rules, you'd need to
    reboot the machine.
    
    To use this option, you'd need a modified version of auditctl and use "-e 2".
    This is intended to go at the end of the audit.rules file for people that
    want an immutable configuration.
    
    This patch also adds "res=" to a number of configuration commands that did not
    have it before.

    bugfixes and new hardware support for arcnet driver
    
    The modifications and bug fixes noted below were done by Realtime Control
    Works and Contemporary Control Systems, Inc, Jan 2005.  They were
    incorporated into the 2.6 kernel by Jeff Morrow of Sierra Analytics, Feb
    2007.  <jmorrow@massspec.com>
    
    The changes have been tested on a Contemporary Controls PCI20U-4000.
    
    Summary of changes:
    
    Arc-rawmode.c:
          rx():
          - Fixed error in received packet lengths; 256 byte packets were
            being received as 257 bytes packets.
    
          prepare_tx():
          - Fixed error in transmit length calcs; 257 byte packets were being
            transmitted as 260 byte packets.
    
    com20020.c:
          com20020_check():
          - We now load the SETUP2 register if the 'clockm' parameter is
            non-zero, instead of checking for ARC_CAN_10MBIT. The user is
            now responsible for whether or not SETUP2 is loaded.  If the
            clock multiplier is non-zero, this means that the user wants a
            baud rate greater than 2.5Mbps. This is not possible unless the
            SETUP2 register is present (COM20020D, or COM20022). So, we're
            relying on the user to be smart about what kind of chip he's
            dealing with...
    
    com20020-pci.c
          - Added several entries to com20020pci_id_table[].

    gianfar: don't duplicate gfar_error()
    
    It was hardly necessary to repeat most of the code from gfar_error() in

    The line :

    is obviously wrong as RIO_PCI_INT_ENABLE=0x04 and is used as a bitmask
    2 lines before. Getting no IRQ would not disable RIO_PCI_INT_ENABLE
    but rather RIO_PCI_BOOT_FROM_RAM which equals 0x01.

    [POWERPC] 83xx: Updated and renamed MPC8360PB to MPC836x MDS
    
    The MPC836x PB board is really just one part of the MPC836x MDS.  We currently
    name all other PB boards as MDS.  Removed all references to PB and replaced
    with MDS.  Additionally renamed the .dts to match the defconfig (mpc836x_mds*).

    [ARM] 4185/2: entry: introduce get_irqnr_preamble and arch_ret_to_user
    
    get_irqnr_preamble allows machines to take some action before entering the
    get_irqnr_and_base loop.  On iop we enable cp6 access.
    
    arch_ret_to_user is added to the userspace return path to allow individual
    architectures to take actions, like disabling coprocessor access, before
    the final return to userspace.
    
    Per Nicolas Pitre's note, there is no need to cp_wait on the return to user
    as the latency to return is sufficient.

    [ARM] 4090/2: avoid clash between PXA and SA1111 defines
    
    The Lubbock platform uses both a PXA25x and a SA1111 at the same time.
    Both chips have the same "Serial Audio Controller" registers although
    the SA1111 one is never expected to be used in preference to the PXA25x
    one. So let's disable the SA1111 defines whenever compilation is for a
    PXA architecture and make the PXA defines always defined.
    
    This removes a bunch of "already defined" warnings as well since the
    current hack to prevent them depended on include ordering which wasn't
    always right.
    
    While at it, clean up the SA1111 defines allowing to get rid of the
    __CCREG() macro.

    [PARISC] Fix show_stack() when we can't kmalloc
    
    show_stack() was calling kzalloc() to allocate a struct pt_regs.
    This meant that *really* early stack dumps would cause a null pointer
    dereference.  x86_64 allocates its pt_regs on the stack, so do the same.
    
    Kyle actually committed this exact patch to CVS on
    Wed Jul 26 14:32:39 2006 UTC, and never moved it across to git.
    Bad Kyle.

    drivers/ide: PATA driver for Celleb
    
    This is the patch (based on 2.6.19-rc4) for PATA controller of
    Toshiba Cell reference set(Celleb). The reference set consists
    of Cell, 512MB memory, Super Companion Chip(SCC) and some
    peripherals such as HDD, GbE, etc. You can see brief explanation
    and picture of Cell reference set at following URLs.
    
        http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2005_09/pr2001.htm
        http://cell-industries.com/toshiba_announces.php
    
    We use a drivers/ide driver because its design is more suitable for
    SCC IDE controller than libata driver. Since SCC supports only 32bit
    read/write, we must override many callbacks of ata_port_operations
    by modifying generic helpers. Each time the libata common code is
    updated, we must update those modified helpers. It is very hard for us.
    But we will try to implement the libata driver as needed.

    sl82c105: DMA support fixes
    
    Fix a number of issues with the DMA support code:
    
    - driver claims support for all SW/MW DMA modes while supporting only MWDMA2;
    
    - ide_dma_check() method tries to enable DMA on the "known good" drives which
      don't support MWDMA2;
    
    - ide_dma_on() method upon failure to set drive to MWDMA2 re-tunes already
      tuned PIO mode and calls ide_dma_off() method instead of returning error;
    
    - ide_dma_off() method sets drive->current_speed while it doesn't actually
      change (only the PIO timings are re-loaded into the chip's registers);
    
    - init_hwif() method forcibly sets/resets both "drive DMA capable" bits while
      this is properly handled by ide_dma_{on,off}() methods being called later...

    ide-floppy: Fix unformatted media crash
    
    A ZIP or similar with unformatted media will cause crashes when attempts
    are made to read/write it in some cases. This is because bs_factor is
    zero and we divide by it causing an oops.
    
    As the size of a non-accessible/non-existant media is really a bit of a
    zen question it doesn't matter if non-existant media is 512 bytes per
    sector or zero. Setting it to 1 causes us to generate 512 bytes/sector
    accesses and error properly.
    
    Based on a fix found lurking in an ancient bugzilla entry since about 2004 (ugghhh)

    atiixp/jmicron/triflex: fix PIO fallback
    
    * atiixp: if DMA can't be used atiixp_config_drive_for_dma() should return 0,
      atiixp_dma_check() will tune the correct PIO mode anyway
    
    * jmicron: if DMA can't be used config_chipset_for_dma() should return 0,
      micron_config_drive_for_dma() will tune the correct PIO mode anyway
    
      config_jmicron_chipset_for_pio(drive, !speed) doesn't program
      device transfer mode for speed != 0 (only wastes some CPU cycles
      on ide_get_best_pio_mode() call) so remove it
    
    * triflex: if DMA can't be used triflex_config_drive_for_dma() should return 0,
      triflex_config_drive_xfer_rate() will tune correct PIO mode anyway
    
    Above changes also fix (theoretical) issue when ->speedproc fails to set
    device transfer mode (i.e. when ide_config_drive_speed() fails to program it)
    but one of DMA transfer modes is already enabled on the device by the BIOS.
    In such scenario ide_dma_enable() will incorrectly return true statement
    and ->ide_dma_check will try to enable DMA on the device.

    USB: unconfigure devices which have config 0
    
    Some USB devices do have a configuration 0, in contravention of the
    USB spec.  Normally 0 is supposed to indicate that a device is
    unconfigured.
    
    While we can't change what the device is doing, we can change usbcore.
    This patch (as852) allows usb_set_configuration() to accept a config
    value of -1 as indicating that the device should be unconfigured.  The
    request actually sent to the device will still contain 0 as the value.
    But even if the device does have a configuration 0, dev->actconfig
    will be set to NULL and dev->state will be set to USB_STATE_ADDRESS.
    
    Without some sort of special-case handling like this, there is no way
    to unconfigure these non-compliant devices.

    USB: fix g_serial small error
    
    A SET_LINE_CODING control request should return a zero length packet
    as an ACK to the host, during the status phase of a USB transaction.
    
    The return value of gs_setup_class() is treated as the number of
    bytes to write in the status phase of the control request, by
    gs_setup(). For this case, the value returned by gs_setup_class should
    be zero for SET_LINE_CODING but, right now, appears to be
    sizeof(struct usb_cdc_line_coding).
    
    However, if after doing the memcpy of the line coding descriptor we
    set the variable "ret" to be zero, we should return the appropiate ZLP
    to the host as an ACK in the status phase of the control request.
    I've tested this out using Linux as both host and slave and confirmed
    that the following small change fixes the spurious return of
    sizeof(struct usb_cdc_line_coding)/wLength bytes in the status phase
    of a USB_CDC_REQ_SET_LINE_CODING request. It's not a huge bug but, it
    is worth fixing.

    USB: add flow control to usb-serial generic driver.
    
    I added two fields to struct usb_serial_port to keep track of the
    throttle state. Other usb-serial drivers typically use private data for
    such things, but the generic driver can not really do that because some
    of its code is also used by other drivers (which may have their own
    private data needs).
    
    As it is, I am not sure that this patch is useful in all scenarios.
    It is certainly helpful for low-bandwidth devices that can hold their
    data in response to throttling. But for devices that pump data in
    real-time as fast as possible (webcam, A/D converter, etc), throttling
    may actually cause more data loss.

    PCI: PCI devices get assigned redundant IRQs
    
    I'm currently working on a port to a CPCI board with a MPC5200.  When
    testing the PCI interrupt routing, I discovered the following: Even devices
    which don't use interrupts (-> PCI Spec.: Interrupt Pin Register is zero),
    get an interrupt assigned (this is at least true for most of the
    PPC-targets I looked at).
    
    The cause is pretty obvious in drivers/pci/setup-irq.c.  I guess at least
    in an ideal world with correctly designed hardware, the code should rather
    look as in the patch below.
    
    Of course it doesn't hurt anybody to have an unuseable IRQ assigned to a
    PCI-to-PCI-bridge (or something alike), but to me it seems a bit strange.
    Please correct me, if I'm mislead.
    
    The patch below is tested on the above mentioned CPCI-MPC5200 board and is
    compiler tested with the latest git-repository kernel on x86.

    kobject: kobj->k_name verification fix
    
    The function 'kobject_add' tries to verify the name of
    a new kobject instance is properly set before continuing.
        if (!kobj->k_name)
            kobj->k_name = kobj->name;
        if (!kobj->k_name) {
            pr_debug("kobject attempted to be registered with no name!\n");
            WARN_ON(1);
            return -EINVAL;
        }
    The statement:
        if (!kobj->k_name) {
            pr_debug("kobject attempted to be registered with no name!\n");
            WARN_ON(1);
            return -EINVAL;
        }
    is useless the way it is right now, because it can never be true. I
    think the
    code was intended to be:
        if (!kobj->k_name)
            kobj->k_name = kobj->name;
        if (!*kobj->k_name) {
            pr_debug("kobject attempted to be registered with no name!\n");
            WARN_ON(1);
            return -EINVAL;
        }
    because this would make sure the kobj->name buffer has something in it.
    So the missing '*' is just a typo. Although, I would much prefer
    expression like:
        if (*kobj->k_name == '\0') {
            pr_debug("kobject attempted to be registered with no name!\n");
            WARN_ON(1);
            return -EINVAL;
        }
    
    because this would've made the intention clear, in this patch I just restore
    the missing '*' without changing the coding style of the function.

    RDMA/cma: Add multicast communication support
    
    Extend rdma_cm to support multicast communication.  Multicast support
    is added to the existing RDMA_PS_UDP port space, as well as a new
    RDMA_PS_IPOIB port space.  The latter port space allows joining the
    multicast groups used by IPoIB, which enables offloading IPoIB traffic
    to a separate QP.  The port space determines the signature used in the
    MGID when joining the group.  The newly added RDMA_PS_IPOIB also
    allows for unicast operations, similar to RDMA_PS_UDP.
    
    Supporting the RDMA_PS_IPOIB requires changing how UD QPs are initialized,
    since we can no longer assume that the qkey is constant.  This requires
    saving the Q_Key to use when attaching to a device, so that it is
    available when creating the QP.  The Q_Key information is exported to
    the user through the existing rdma_init_qp_attr() interface.
    
    Multicast support is also exported to userspace through the rdma_ucm.

    IB/sa: Track multicast join/leave requests
    
    The IB SA tracks multicast join/leave requests on a per port basis and
    does not do any reference counting: if two users of the same port join
    the same group, and one leaves that group, then the SA will remove the
    port from the group even though there is one user who wants to stay a
    member left.  Therefore, in order to support multiple users of the
    same multicast group from the same port, we need to perform reference
    counting locally.
    
    To do this, add an multicast submodule to ib_sa to perform reference
    counting of multicast join/leave operations.  Modify ib_ipoib (the
    only in-kernel user of multicast) to use the new interface.

    iwcm iw_cm_id destruction race condition fixes:
    
    - iwcm_deref_id() always wakes up if there's another reference.
    - clean up race condition in cm_work_handler().
    - create static void free_cm_id() which deallocs the work entries and then
      kfrees the cm_id memory.  This reduces code replication.
    - rem_ref() if this is the last reference -and- the IWCM owns freeing the

    [PATCH] eCryptfs: Reduce stack usage in ecryptfs_generate_key_packet_set()
    
    eCryptfs is gobbling a lot of stack in ecryptfs_generate_key_packet_set()
    because it allocates a temporary memory-hungry ecryptfs_key_record struct.
    This patch introduces a new kmem_cache for that struct and converts
    ecryptfs_generate_key_packet_set() to use it.

    [PATCH] knfsd: stop NFSD writes from being broken into lots of little writes to filesystem
    
    When NFSD receives a write request, the data is typically in a number of
    1448 byte segments and writev is used to collect them together.
    
    Unfortunately, generic_file_buffered_write passes these to the filesystem
    one at a time, so an e.g.  32K over-write becomes a series of partial-page
    writes to each page, causing the filesystem to have to pre-read those pages
    - wasted effort.
    
    generic_file_buffered_write handles one segment of the vector at a time as
    it has to pre-fault in each segment to avoid deadlocks.  When writing from
    kernel-space (and nfsd does) this is not an issue, so
    generic_file_buffered_write does not need to break and iovec from nfsd into
    little pieces.
    
    This patch avoids the splitting when  get_fs is KERNEL_DS as it is
    from NFSd.
    
    This issue was introduced by commit 6527c2bdf1f833cc18e8f42bd97973d583e4aa83

    [PATCH] knfsd: nfsd4: acls: avoid unnecessary denies
    
    We're inserting deny's between some ACEs in order to enforce posix draft acl
    semantics which prevent permissions from accumulating across entries in an
    acl.
    
    That's fine, but we're doing that by inserting a deny after *every* allow,
    which is overkill.  We shouldn't be adding them in places where they actually
    make no difference.
    
    Also replaced some helper functions for creating acl entries; I prefer just
    assigning directly to the struct fields--it takes a few more lines, but the
    field names provide some documentation that I think makes the result easier
    understand.

    [PATCH] knfsd: nfsd4: relax checking of ACL inheritance bits
    
    The rfc allows us to be more permissive about the ACL inheritance bits we
    accept:
    
    	"If the server supports a single "inherit ACE" flag that applies to
    	both files and directories, the server may reject the request
    	(i.e., requiring the client to set both the file and directory
    	inheritance flags). The server may also accept the request and
    	silently turn on the ACE4_DIRECTORY_INHERIT_ACE flag."
    
    Let's take the latter option--the ACL is a complex attribute that could be
    rejected for a wide variety of reasons, and the protocol gives us little
    ability to explain the reason for the rejection, so erroring out is a
    user-unfriendly last resort.

    [PATCH] knfsd: nfsd4: fix non-terminated string
    
    The server name is expected to be a null-terminated string, so we can't pass
    in the raw client identifier.
    
    What's more, the client identifier is just a binary, not necessarily
    printable, blob.  Let's just use the ip address instead.  The server name
    appears to exist just to help debugging by making some printk's more
    informative.
    
    Note that the string is copies into the rpc client structure, so the pointer
    to the local variable does not outlive the function call.

    [PATCH] genirq: do not mask interrupts by default
    
    Never mask interrupts immediately upon request.  Disabling interrupts in
    high-performance codepaths is rare, and on the other hand this change could
    recover lost edges (or even other types of lost interrupts) by conservatively
    only masking interrupts after they happen.  (NOTE: with this change the
    highlevel irq-disable code still soft-disables this IRQ line - and if such an
    interrupt happens then the IRQ flow handler keeps the IRQ masked.)
    
    Mark i8529A controllers as 'never loses an edge'.

    [PATCH] posix timers: RCU optimization for clock_gettime()
    
    Use RCU to avoid the need to acquire tasklist_lock in the single-threaded
    case of clock_gettime().  It still acquires tasklist_lock when for a
    (potentially multithreaded) process.  This change allows realtime
    applications to frequently monitor CPU consumption of individual tasks, as
    requested (and now deployed) by some off-list users.
    
    This has been in Ingo Molnar's -rt patchset since late 2005 with no
    problems reported, and tests successfully on 2.6.20-rc6, so I believe that
    it is long-since ready for mainline adoption.

    [PATCH] i386 prepare nmi watchdog for dynticks
    
    The NMI watchdog implementation assumes that the local APIC timer interrupt is
    happening.  This assumption is not longer true when high resolution timers and
    dynamic ticks come into play, as they may switch off the local APIC timer
    completely.  Take the PIT/HPET interrupts into account too, to avoid false
    positives.

    [PATCH] i386 rework local apic timer calibration
    
    The local apic timer calibration has two problem cases:
    
    1.  The calibration is based on readout of the PIT/HPET timer to detect the
       wrap of the periodic tick.  It happens that a box gets stuck in the
       calibration loop due to a PIT with a broken readout function.
    
    2.  CoreDuo boxen show a sporadic PIT runs too slow defect, which results
       in a wrong lapic calibration.  The PIT goes back to normal operation once
       the lapic timer is switched to periodic mode.
    
    Both are existing and unfixed problems in the current upstream kernel and
    prevent certain laptops and other systems from booting Linux.
    
    Rework the code to address both problems:
    
    - Make the calibration interrupt driven.  This removes the wait_timer_tick
      magic hackery from lapic.c and time_hpet.c.  The clockevents framework
      allows easy substitution of the global tick event handler for the
      calibration.  This is more accurate than monitoring jiffies.  At this point
      of the boot process, nothing disturbes the interrupt delivery, so the
      results are very accurate.
    
    - Verify the calibration against the PM timer, when available by using the
      early access function.  When the measured calibration period is outside of
      an one percent window, then the lapic timer calibration is adjusted to the
      pm timer result.
    
    - Verify the calibration by running the lapic timer with the calibration
      handler.  Disable lapic timer in case of deviation.
    
    This also removes the "synchronization" of the local apic timer to the global
    tick.  This synchronization never worked, as there is no way to synchronize
    PIT(HPET) and local APIC timer.  The synchronization by waiting for the tick
    just alignes the local APIC timer for the first events, but later the events
    drift away due to the different clocks.  Removing the "sync" is just
    randomizing the asynchronous behaviour at setup time.

    Add broadcast functionality, so per cpu clock event devices can be registered

    function distributes the events via the broadcast function of the clock event
    device.  This is primarily designed to replace the switch apic timer to / from
    IPI in power states, where the apic stops.

    [PATCH] clockevents: add core functionality
    
    Architectures register their clock event devices, in the clock events core.
    Users of the clockevents core can get clock event devices for their use.  The
    clockevents core code provides notification mechanisms for various clock
    related management events.
    
    This allows to control the clock event devices without the architectures
    having to worry about the details of function assignment.  This is also a
    preliminary for high resolution timers and dynamic ticks to allow the core
    code to control the clock functionality without intrusive changes to the
    architecture code.

    [PATCH] Allow early access to the power management timer
    
    Allow early access to the power management timer by exposing the verified read
    function and providing a helper function which checks the pmtmr_ioport
    variable and returns either the pm timer readout or 0 in case the pm timer is
    not available.
    
    Create a new header file and replace also the ifdef'ed extern definition in
    arch/i386/kernel/acpi/boot.c
    
    This is a preperatory patch for the rework of the local apic timer
    calibration.
    
    No functional changes.

    This is a preperatory patch for highres/dyntick:
    
    - replace the big #ifdef ARCH_APICTIMER_STOPS_ON_C3 hackery by functions
    
    - remove the double switch in the power verify function (in the worst case
      we switched ipi to apic and 20usec later apic to ipi)
    
    - keep track of the the state which stops local APIC timer

    argument.  Provide a compability function for the existing implementations to

    original code vs.  jiffies changing during the iteration.)

    [PATCH] Fix cascade lookup of next_timer_interrupt
    
    When searching for the next pending timer in the timer wheel we need to take
    the cascade into account.  The current code has several problems:
    
     1. it looks into the previous cascade
     2. it ignores a pending cascade
     3. it ignores multiple cascades
    
    Change the cascade lookup, so it calculates the array index from the point of
    the next cascade and always look at the cascade buckets, when the cascade is
    pending, i.e.  gets executed in the next timer softirq.  When multiple
    cascades are pending, then lookup the next buckets too.

    [PATCH] Mark TSC on GeodeLX reliable
    
    The Geode can safely use the TSC for highres, since:
    
    1) Does not support frequency scaling,
    
    2) The TSC _does_ count when the CPU is halted.  Furthermore, the Geode
       supports a mode called "suspension on halt", where Suspend mode (which
       interacts with the power management states) is entered.  TSC counting
       during suspend mode is controlled by bit 8 of the Bus Controller
       Configuration Register #0 (thanks Tom!).
    
    3) no SMP :)
    
    Check if "RTSC counts during suspension" and remove the requirement for
    verification, so the clocksource code can safely select it as an timesource
    for the highres timers subsystem.

    hardwired assumptions of available hardware, provide a generic verification

    the usability for high resolution timers / dynticks of the clocksource which
    needs to be verified.

    [PATCH] x86: rewrite SMP TSC sync code
    
    make the TSC synchronization code more robust, and unify it between x86_64 and
    i386.
    
    The biggest change is the removal of the 'fix up TSCs' code on x86_64 and
    i386, in some rare cases it was /causing/ time-warps on SMP systems.
    
    The new code only checks for TSC asynchronity - and if it can prove a
    time-warp (if it can observe the TSC going backwards when going from one CPU
    to another within a critical section), then the TSC clock-source is turned
    off.
    
    The TSC synchronization-checking code also got moved into a separate file.

    [PATCH] Fix timeout overflow with jiffies
    
    Prevent timeout overflow if timer ticks are behind jiffies (due to high
    softirq load or due to dyntick), by limiting the valid timeout range to

    [PATCH] Fix multiple conversion bugs in msecs_to_jiffies
    
    Fix multiple conversion bugs in msecs_to_jiffies().
    
    The main problem is that this condition:
    
    	if (m > jiffies_to_msecs(MAX_JIFFY_OFFSET))
    
    overflows if HZ is smaller than 1000!
    
    This change is user-visible: for HZ=250 SUS-compliant poll()-timeout
    value of -20 is mistakenly converted to 'immediate timeout'.
    
    (The new dyntick code also triggered this, that's how we noticed.)

    [PATCH] uml: fix 2.6.20 hang
    
    A previous cleanup misused need_poll, which had a fairly broken interface.
    It implemented a growable array, changing the used elements count itself,
    but leaving it up to the caller to fill in the actual elements, including
    the entire array if the array had to be reallocated.  This worked because
    the previous users were switching between two such structures, and the
    elements were copied from the inactive array to the active array after
    making sure the active array had enough room.
    
    maybe_sigio_broken was made to use need_poll, but it was operating on a
    single array, so when the buffer was reallocated, the previous contents
    were lost.
    
    This patch makes need_poll implement more sane semantics.  It merely
    assures that the array is of the proper size and that the contents are
    preserved.  It is up to the caller to adjust the used elements count and to
    ensure that the proper elements are resent.
    
    This manifested itself as a hang in 2.6.20 as the uninitialized buffer
    convinced UML that one of its own file descriptors didn't support SIGIO and
    needed to be watched by poll in a separate thread.  The result was an
    interrupt flood as control traffic over this descriptor sparked interrupts,
    which resulted in more control traffic, ad nauseum.

    A particular USB device has been reporting short inquiry lengths.  The
    SCSI code cannot operate properly unless we get an inquiry length of
    36 or above (because of the way we parse vendor and product), so
    assume at least 36 bytes are valid even if the device reports fewer.
    This is wrong, but it's no worse than what we're doing now (using the
    garbage beyond the last reported valid byte).

    The sequencer firmware file has both a string (currently showing

    that Adaptec may issue sequencer firmware in the future which could be
    incompatible with the current driver.  Therefore, the driver will be
    tied to the particular major number of the firmware (i.e. the current
    driver will load any 1.x firmware).  Additionally, the driver will print
    out both the ascii string and the major number, so with this pach the
    current firmware will print out

    - It wrongly assumes that the ring buffer size of the interface (64KB)
    is larger than or equal to the system page size. This patch sets the
    ring buffer size to PAGE_SIZE if the system page size is larger.
    
    - It uses PAGE_SIZE in the header file exported to userspace. This

    [SCSI] sgiwd93: interfacing to wd33c93
    
    1) sgiwd93 used to switch off asynchronous mode on the wd33c93, discarding
       any "nosync"-requests from the commandline.
       But we need to allow "nosync"-requests for selected devices, for example
       the Pioneer DVD305S.
       (For the curious: this device accepts the SDTR from wd33c93 and success-
       fully sends inquiry data in sync mode, but after the data phase in the
       inquiry command does an unexpected disconnect, seemingly sending no
       "status" or "command complete". Forcing async transfers makes it work
       together flawlessly with the wd33c93. Of course, preferable would be, to
       implement wd33c93's "resume command" stuff, but that probably will not
       come soon.)
    
    2) Maximize benefit from the preceding Fast SCSI patch for wd33c93 by passing
       the higher input-clock frequency explicitely. To be applied after the
       mentioned wd33c93 patch.

    [SCSI] wd33c93: Fast SCSI with WD33C93B
    
    Attached are patches, which help to utilize more of the WD33C93B SCSI
    controller's capabilities.
    
    1) Added/changed all the necessary code to enable Burst Mode DMA. Only
       Single Byte DMA was used before.
    
    2) Added/changed all the necessary code to enable Fast-10 SCSI transfers.
    
    3) The original driver inadvertently used a transfer period of 1000-800ns
       (the lowest possible transfer rate) for asynchronous data transfers,
       instead of the (configurable) default period intended for this purpose,
       if the target responded to a SDTR not with a Reject-message, but with
       a zero-SDTR. This issue was fixed.
       Moreover, in case of a Reject the driver used the default-period's
       initialization-value instead of its (maybe smaller) current value. The
       missing assignment was added.
    
    4) The driver's commandline- and proc-file-interface was augmented to
       handle the new options properly.
    
    The WD33C93 manual, found at
    http://www.datasheet.in/datasheet-html/W/D/3/WD33C93B_WesternDigital.pdf.html,
    was very helpful.

    The new code simply lists the referencing devices which

    [POWERPC] More DCR native fixups
    
    Getting BenH's new EMAC driver working on 440GP, I found some more
    problems in the native mode paths of the new DCR code:
    	- dcr_map() is supposed to return a dcr_host_t, but the native
    version is a macro that doesn't expand to an expression.  With native
    DCRs, dcr_host_t is an empty structure, so we just use a constructor
    expression instead.
    	- dcr_unmap() uses {} instead of the safer do {} while (0)
    idiom to implement a no-op
    
    Here's a fix.

    This patch updates the sata_promise driver to use new-style
    libata error handling for 20619 (TX4000) chips. sata_promise
    already uses new EH for the other chips it supports, so the
    patch is quite simple:
    
    * remove ->phy_reset and ->eng_timeout ops from pdc_pata_ops,
      and instead bind ->freeze, ->thaw, ->error_handler, and
      ->post_internal_cmd to existing new EH functions
    * drop ATA_FLAG_SRST from board_20619's flags
    * remove now unused pdc_pata_phy_reset() and pdc_eng_timeout()
    
    Tested on a TX4000 with both modern working disks and old/quirky

    Execute AML Notify() requests on stack.
    
    HP nx6125/nx6325/... machines have a _GPE handler with an infinite
    loop sending Notify() events to different ACPI subsystems.
    
    The notify handler in the ACPI thermal driver is a C-routine,
    which may invoke the ACPI interpreter again to get access
    to some ACPI variables such as temperature.  (acpi_evaluate_xxx)
    On these HP machines such an evaluation changes state of an ASL variable
    and lets the loop above break.
    
    In the current ACPI implementation, Notify requests are being deferred
    to the same kacpid workqueue on which the above GPE handler with
    infinite loop is executing. Thus we have a deadlock -- loop will
    continue to spin, sending notify events, and at the same time
    preventing these notify events from being run on a workqueue. All
    notify events are deferred, thus we see explosion in memory consumption.
    
    Also as GPE handling is blocked, machines overheat because ACPI-based
    fan control is stalled.  Eventually by external poll of the same
    acpi_evaluate, kacpid is released and all the queued notify events are
    free to run, thus 100% CPU utilization by kacpid for several seconds
    or more.
    
    To prevent this failure,  Linux must not send notify events to the
    kacpid workqueue -- either executing them immediately or putting them
    on some other thread.
    
    The first attempt to create a new thread was done by Peter Wainwright
    He created a bunch of threads, which were stealing work from a kacpid
    workqueue.
    This patch appeared in 2.6.15-based kernel shipped with Ubuntu 6.06 LTS.
    
    Second attempt was done by Alexey Starikovskiy, who created a new thread
    for each Notify event. This worked OK on HP nx machines,
    but broke Linus' Compaq n620c, by producing threads with a speed what
    they stopped the machine completely.
    Thus this patch was reverted from 2.6.18-rc2.
    
    Alexey re-made the patch to create second workqueue just for notify events,
    thus hopping it will not break Linus' machine. Patch was tested on the
    same HP nx machines in #5534 and #7122, but this broke Linus' machine
    also and was reverted from 2.6.19-rc with much fanfair.
    
    The 4th patch inserted schedule_timeout(1) into deferred
    execution of kacpid, if we had any notify requests pending, but Linus
    decided that it was too complex (involved either changes to workqueue
    to see if it's empty or atomic inc/dec).  Then a 5th attempt did a
    yield() to every GPE execution.
    
    Finally, this 6th generation patch simply executes the notify handler
    on the stack.  Previous attempts to do this simple solution failed
    because of issues in AML mutex re-entrancy which are now fixed
    by the previous patch in this series.

    ACPICA: fix AML mutex re-entrancy
    
    ACPI AML supports "serialized" methods which are protected
    by an implicit mutex.  The mutex is re-entrant for that AML thread
    to allow recursion.
    
    However, Linux implements notify() by creating a new AML thread.
    So for systems where notify() re-enters a serialized method,
    deadlock results.
    
    The fix is to use the Linux thread_id as the key to allowing
    re-entrancy, not the AML thread pointer.

    [CPUFREQ] Longhaul - Redo Longhaul ver. 2
    
    Start using v2 version of Longhaul when available. It provides
    voltage scaling and can use ACPI C3 state. That's curious. CPU
    will not change frequency on ACPI C3 when v1 is in use, but it will
    when v2 is used. Driver will return max frequency all the time if
    this isn't true for all processors. There is strange thing with
    mobile voltage. Looks like only Nehemiah (C3-M) supports it.
    Earlier processors have different mobile VRM (in docs), but I can't
    find any which is using it. Looks like all are using VRM 8.5. So
    fail for non Nehemiah with mobile VRM.

    [PATCH] ieee80211softmac: Fix setting of initial transmit rates
    
    There is a bug in ieee80211softmac that always sets the user rate
    to 11Mbs, no matter the capabilities of the device. This bug was
    probably beneficial as long as the bcm43xx cards were rate limited;
    however, most are now capable of relatively high speeds. This patch
    fixes that bug and eliminates an assert that is no longer needed.
    
    Once the cards are capable of full OFDM speeds, the 24 Mbs rate will
    be changed to 54 Mbs.

    [PATCH] bcm43xx: OFDM fix for rev 1 cards
    
    Nearly all of the writes to the bcm43xx internal lookup tables (ilt)
    involve 16-bit quantities. Accordingly, the ilt_write routine was
    coded to pass a u16 value. For one early GPHY chip, 32-bit quantities
    are needed. For those writes, the value was clipped to 16 bits. This
    patch adds an ilt_write32 routine that receives a 32-bit quantity
    and writes it to the appropriate locations.

    back then, but platform_device_put and platform_device_release
    both appear to free the platform data associated with the device.
    This makes an explicit kfree redundant at best, and maybe even

    hwmon: Simplify the locking model of two drivers
    
    Many hardware monitoring drivers use two different mutexes, one to
    protect their per-device data structure, and one to protect the
    access to the device registers. These mutexes are essentially
    redundant, as the drivers are transfering values between the device
    registers and the data cache, so they almost always end up holding
    both mutexes at the same time. Using a single mutex will make the
    code more simple and faster.
    
    I am changing only two of the affected drivers here, the authors
    of the other affected drivers are welcome to submit similar patches
    if they want.

    [PATCH] sysctl: hide the sysctl proc inodes from selinux
    
    Since the security checks are applied on each read and write of a sysctl file,
    just like they are applied when calling sys_sysctl, they are redundant on the
    standard VFS constructs.  Since it is difficult to compute the security labels
    on the standard VFS constructs we just mark the sysctl inodes in proc private
    so selinux won't even bother with them.

    [PATCH] selinux: enhance selinux to always ignore private inodes
    
    Hmmm...turns out to not be quite enough, as the /proc/sys inodes aren't truly
    private to the fs, so we can run into them in a variety of security hooks
    beyond just the inode hooks, such as security_file_permission (when reading
    and writing them via the vfs helpers), security_sb_mount (when mounting other
    filesystems on directories in proc like binfmt_misc), and deeper within the
    security module itself (as in flush_unauthorized_files upon inheritance across
    execve).  So I think we have to add an IS_PRIVATE() guard within SELinux, as
    below.  Note however that the use of the private flag here could be confusing,
    as these inodes are _not_ private to the fs, are exposed to userspace, and
    security modules must implement the sysctl hook to get any access control over
    them.

    [PATCH] sysctl: reimplement the sysctl proc support
    
    With this change the sysctl inodes can be cached and nothing needs to be done
    when removing a sysctl table.
    
    For a cost of 2K code we will save about 4K of static tables (when we remove
    de from ctl_table) and 70K in proc_dir_entries that we will not allocate, or
    about half that on a 32bit arch.
    
    The speed feels about the same, even though we can now cache the sysctl
    dentries :(
    
    We get the core advantage that we don't need to have a 1 to 1 mapping between
    ctl table entries and proc files.  Making it possible to have /proc/sys vary
    depending on the namespace you are in.  The currently merged namespaces don't
    have an issue here but the network namespace under /proc/sys/net needs to have
    different directories depending on which network adapters are visible.  By
    simply being a cache different directories being visible depending on who you
    are is trivial to implement.

    [PATCH] sysctl: factor out sysctl_head_next from do_sysctl
    
    The current logic to walk through the list of sysctl table headers is slightly
    painful and implement in a way it cannot be used by code outside sysctl.c
    
    I am in the process of implementing a version of the sysctl proc support that
    instead of using the proc generic non-caching monster, just uses the existing
    sysctl data structure as backing store for building the dcache entries and for
    doing directory reads.  To use the existing data structures however I need a
    way to get at them.

    [PATCH] sysctl: remove insert_at_head from register_sysctl
    
    The semantic effect of insert_at_head is that it would allow new registered
    sysctl entries to override existing sysctl entries of the same name.  Which is
    pain for caching and the proc interface never implemented.
    
    I have done an audit and discovered that none of the current users of
    register_sysctl care as (excpet for directories) they do not register
    duplicate sysctl entries.
    
    So this patch simply removes the support for overriding existing entries in
    the sys_sysctl interface since no one uses it or cares and it makes future
    enhancments harder.

    [PATCH] sysctl: create sys/fs/binfmt_misc as an ordinary sysctl entry
    
    binfmt_misc has a mount point in the middle of the sysctl and that mount point
    is created as a proc_generic directory.
    
    Doing it that way gets in the way of cleaning up the sysctl proc support as it
    continues the existence of a horrible hack.  So instead simply create the
    directory as an ordinary sysctl directory.  At least that removes the magic
    special case.

    Basically everything was done but I removed all element initializers from the

    [PATCH] sysctl: C99 convert arch/sh64/kernel/traps.c and remove ABI breakage
    
    While doing the C99 conversion I notices that the top level sh64 directory was
    using the binary number for CTL_KERN.  That is a no-no so I removed the
    support for the sysctl binary interface only leaving sysctl /proc support.
    
    At least the sysctl tables were placed at the end of the list so user space
    did not see this mistake.

    [PATCH] sysctl: C99 convert arch/mips/lasat/sysctl.c and remove ABI breakage
    
    While C99 converting the ctl_table initializers I realized that the binary
    sysctl numbers were in conflict with the binary values under CTL_KERN.
    Including CTL_KERN KERN_VERSION as used by glibc.  So I just removed the
    sysctl binary interface for these values, as it was unsupportable.
    
    Luckily these sysctl were inserted at the end of the sysctl list so this bug
    was not visible to userspace.

    [PATCH] sysctl: C99 convert arch/ia64/kernel/perfmon and remove ABI breakage
    
    This convters the sysctl ctl_tables to use C99 initializers.  While I was
    looking at it I discovered it was using a portion of the sysctl binary
    addresses space under CTL_KERN KERN_OSTYPE which was completely inappropriate.
     So I completely removed all of the sysctl binary names, to remove and avoid
    the ABI conflict.

    [PATCH] sysctl: sn: remove sysctl ABI BREAKAGE
    
    By not using the enumeration in sysctl.h (or even understanding it) the SN
    platform placed their arch specific xpc directory on top of CTL_KERN and only
    because they didn't have 4 entries in their xpc directory got lucky and didn't
    break glibc.
    
    This is totally irresponsible.  So this patch entirely removes sys_sysctl
    support from their sysctl code.  Hopefully they don't have ascii name
    conflicts as well.
    
    And now that they have no ABI numbers add them to the end instead of the
    sysctl list instead of the head so nothing else will be overridden.

    [PATCH] sysctl: cdrom: don't set de->owner
    
    There is no need for open files in /proc/sys/XXX to hold a reference count on
    the module that provides the file to prevent module unload races.  While there
    is code active in the module p->used in the sysctl_table_header is
    incremented, preventing the sysctl from being unregisted.  Once the sysctl is
    unregistered it cannot be found.  Open files are also not a problem as they
    revalidate the sysctl information and bump p->used before accessing module
    code.
    
    So setting de->owner is unnecessary, makes for a bad example and gets in my
    way of removing ctl_table->de.

    The sysctl numbers used are unique so setting the insert_at_head flag does not

    [PATCH] sysctl: x25: remove unnecessary insert_at_head from register_sysctl_table
    
    There has not been much maintenance on sysctl in years, and as a result is
    there is a lot to do to allow future interesting work to happen, and being
    ambitious I'm trying to do it all at once :)
    
    The patches in this series fall into several general categories.
    
    - Removal of useless attempts to override the standard sysctls
    
    - Registers of sysctl numbers in sysctl.h so someone else does not use
      the magic number and conflict.
    
    - C99 conversions so it becomes possible to change the layout of
      struct ctl_table without breaking everything.
    
    - Removal of useless claims of module ownership, in the proc dir entries
    
    - Removal of sys_sysctl support where people had used conflicting sysctl
      numbers. Trying to break glibc or other applications by changing the
      ABI is not cool.  9 instances of this in the kernel seems a little
      extreme.
    
    - General enhancements when I got the junk I could see out.
    
    This patch:
    
    Since x25 uses unique binary numbers inserting yourself at the head of the
    search list for sysctls so you can override already registered sysctls is
    pointless.

    [PATCH] remove many unneeded #includes of sched.h
    
    After Al Viro (finally) succeeded in removing the sched.h #include in module.h
    recently, it makes sense again to remove other superfluous sched.h includes.
    There are quite a lot of files which include it but don't actually need
    anything defined in there.  Presumably these includes were once needed for
    macros that used to live in sched.h, but moved to other header files in the
    course of cleaning it up.
    
    To ease the pain, this time I did not fiddle with any header files and only
    removed #includes from .c-files, which tend to cause less trouble.
    
    Compile tested against 2.6.20-rc2 and 2.6.20-rc2-mm2 (with offsets) on alpha,
    arm, i386, ia64, mips, powerpc, and x86_64 with allnoconfig, defconfig,
    allmodconfig, and allyesconfig as well as a few randconfigs on x86_64 and all
    configs in arch/arm/configs on arm.  I also checked that no new warnings were
    introduced by the patch (actually, some warnings are removed that were emitted
    by unnecessarily included header files).

    [PATCH] knfsd: allow the server to provide a gid list when using AUTH_UNIX authentication
    
    AUTH_UNIX authentication (the standard with NFS) has a limit of 16 groups ids.
     This causes problems for people in more than 16 groups.
    
    So allow the server to map a uid into a list of group ids based on local
    knowledge rather depending on the (possibly truncated) list from the client.
    
    If there is no process on the server responding to upcalls, the gidlist in the
    request will still be used.

    [PATCH] knfsd: add some new fsid types
    
    Add support for using a filesystem UUID to identify and export point in the
    filehandle.
    
    For NFSv2, this UUID is xor-ed down to 4 or 8 bytes so that it doesn't take up
    too much room.  For NFSv3+, we use the full 16 bytes, and possibly also a
    64bit inode number for exports beneath the root of a filesystem.
    
    When generating an fsid to return in 'stat' information, use the UUID (hashed
    down to size) if it is available and a small 'fsid' was not specifically
    provided.

    [PATCH] knfsd: tidy up choice of filesystem-identifier when creating a filehandle
    
    If we are using the same version/fsid as a current filehandle, then there is
    no need to verify the the numbers are valid for this export, and they must be
    (we used them to find this export).
    
    This allows us to simplify the fsid selection code.
    
    Also change "ref_fh_version" and "ref_fh_fsid_type" to "version" and
    "fsid_type", as the important thing isn't that they are the version/type of
    the reference filehandle, but they are the chosen type for the new filehandle.
    
    And tidy up some indenting.

    [PATCH] knfsd: fix return value for writes to some files in 'nfsd' filesystem
    
    Most files in the 'nfsd' filesystem are transactional.  When you write, a
    reply is generated that can be read back only on the same 'file'.
    
    If the reply has zero length, the 'write' will incorrectly return a value of
    '0' instead of the length that was written.  This causes 'rpc.nfsd' to give an
    annoying warning.

    [PATCH] 8250 UART backup timer
    
    The patch below works around a minor bug found in the UART of the remote
    management card used in many HP ia64 and parisc servers (aka the Diva
    UARTs).  The problem is that the UART does not reassert the THRE interrupt
    if it has been previously cleared and the IIR THRI bit is re-enabled.  This
    can produce a very annoying failure mode when used as a serial console,
    allowing a boot/reboot to hang indefinitely until an RX interrupt kicks it
    into working again (ie.  an unattended reboot could stall).
    
    To solve this problem, a backup timer is introduced that runs alongside the
    standard interrupt driven mechanism.  This timer wakes up periodically,
    checks for a hang condition and gets characters moving again.  This backup
    mechanism is only enabled if the UART is detected as having this problem,
    so systems without these UARTs will have no additional overhead.
    
    This version of the patch incorporates previous comments from Pavel and
    removes races in the bug detection code.  The test is now done before the
    irq linking to prevent races with interrupt handler clearing the THRE
    interrupt.  Short delays and syncs are also added to ensure the device is
    able to update register state before the result is tested.
    
    Aristeu says:
    
      this was tested on the following HP machines and solved the problem:
      rx2600, rx2620, rx1600 and rx1620s.
    
    hpa says:
    
      I have seen this same bug in soft UART IP from "a major vendor."

    [PATCH] new toplevel target: headers_check_all
    
    Add new headers_check_all target for checking all arches in one go.
    
    Useful for distros (and people with too much time on their hands) that support
    a ton of architectures, headers_check_all is to headers_check as
    headers_install_all is to headers_install

    [PATCH] Make mkcompile_h use LANG=C and LC_ALL=C for $CC -v
    
    Fix a minor bug in mkcompile_h.  As one can see, the current locale is used
    while getting the version of gcc.  This produces problems when a locale
    other than C or en_US is used.  As an example, my /proc/version contains
    Turkish characters in iso-8859-9 encoding.
    
    This patch fixes this issue by making sure that the C locale is used to get
    gcc's version.

    [PATCH] ia64: fix noncoherent DMA API so devres builds
    
    On ia64, drivers/base/dma-mapping.c doesn't build because it calls
    dma_alloc_noncoherent() and dma_free_noncoherent(), which appear to be
    terminally broken; the calls end up generating errors like
    
        drivers/base/dma-mapping.c: In function 'dmam_noncoherent_release':
        drivers/base/dma-mapping.c:32: error: 'struct ia64_machine_vector' has no member named 'platform_dma_free_coherent'
    
    because the multiple levels of macro expansion in <asm/dma-mapping.h> and
    <asm/machvec.h> end up turning a call to dma_free_noncoherent() into
    ia64_mv.platform_dma_free_coherent (instead of the intended
    ia64_mv.dma_free_coherent).
    
    This patch fixes this by converting dma_{alloc,free}_noncoherent() into
    inline functions that call the corresponding coherent functions, instead of
    trying to do this with macros.

    Enable svc access to cp6 via an undefined instruction hook.  Do not enable
    access for usr code.
    
    This patch also makes iop13xx select PLAT_IOP, this requires a small change
    to drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-iop3xx.c.
    
    Per Lennert Buytenhek's note, the cp6 trap routine is moved to arch/arm/plat-iop
    Per Nicolas Pitre's note, the cp_wait is skipped since the latency to
    return to the faulting function is longer than cp_wait.

    [POWERPC] Use udbg_early_init() on ppc32
    
    udbg_early_init() is a function used on 64 bit systems, which
    initializes whichever early udbg backend is configured.  This function
    is not called on 32-bit, however if btext early debug is enabled it
    does have an explicit, inline, #ifdef-ed assignment performing
    analagous initialization.
    
    This patch makes things more uniform by folding the btext
    initialization as an option into udbg_early_init() and calling that
    from the 32-bit setup path.

    [POWERPC] Open Firmware serial port driver
    
    This can be used for serial ports that are connected to an
    OF platform bus but are not autodetected by the lecacy
    serial support.
    It will automatically take over devices that come from the
    legacy serial detection, which usually is only one device.
    
    In some cases, rtas may be set up to use the serial port
    in the firmware, which allows easier debugging before probing
    the serial ports. In this case, the "used-by-rtas" property
    must be set by the firmware. This patch also adds code to the
    legacy serial driver to check for this.

    [PATCH] Fix SAK_work workqueue initialization.
    
    Somewhere in the rewrite of the work queues my cleanup of SAK handling
    got broken.  Maybe I didn't retest it properly or possibly the API
    was changing so fast I missed something.  Regardless currently
    triggering a SAK now generates an ugly BUG_ON and kills the kernel.
    
    Thanks to Alexey Dobriyan <adobriyan@openvz.org> for spotting this.
    
    This modifies the use of SAK_work to initialize it when the data
    structure it resides in is initialized, and to simply call
    schedule_work when we need to generate a SAK.  I update both
    data structures that have a SAK_work member for consistency.
    
    All of the old PREPARE_WORK calls that are now gone.
    
    If we call schedule_work again before it has processed it
    has generated the first SAK it will simply ignore the duplicate
    schedule_work request.

    [MIPS] Make entry.S a little more readable.
    
    When CONFIG_PREEMPT is not set, it also moves one branch instruction from
    ret_from_irq() to ret_from_exception().  Therefore we favour the return
    from irq case which should be more common than the other one.

    When I post a patch (commit f431baa55abf8adeed0c718b51deacbc151f58f1),
    I just tried to not change behavior of existing codes, but it seems
    dec/int-handler.S had been broken since its previous commit

    The caller of plat_irq_dispatch do setup/restore TI_REGS($28), so
    dec's plat_irq_dispatch should not do it, and there is no need to
    adjust RA.

    i2c: Add driver suspend/resume/shutdown support
    
    Driver model updates for the I2C core:
    
     - Add new suspend(), resume(), and shutdown() methods.  Use them in the

     - Minor doc updates to highlight zero-initialized fields in drivers, and
       the driver model accessors for "clientdata".
    
    If any i2c drivers were previously using the old suspend/resume calls
    in "struct driver", they were getting warning messages ... and will
    now no longer work.  Other than that, this patch changes no behaviors;
    and it lets I2C drivers use conventional PM and shutdown support.

    i2c-ali1563: Fix device initialization
    
    The i2c-ali1563 initialization looks quite broken to me:
    * If the I/O space isn't enabled, we forcibly set 3 bits in
      the PCI configuration space instead of just the one enabling
      the I/O space.
    * After that we pretend to check if the write worked, but we
      don't actually read the new value from the register.
    * It's probably not a good idea to enable the I/O space if no
      base address has been set.
    
    So I propose the following changes to that part of the driver:
    * Merge ali1563_enable() into ali1563_setup().
    * Check the base address before the I/O space enabled bit.

    [POWERPC] cell: pm_rtas_activat_signals routine cleanup
    
    The code was setting up the debug bus for group 21 when profiling on the
    event PPU CYCLES.  The debug bus is not actually used by the hardware
    performance counters when counting PPU CYCLES.  Setting up the debug bus
    for PPU CYCLES causes signal routing conflicts on the debug bus when
    profiling PPU cycles and another PPU event.  This patch fixes the code to
    only setup the debug bus to route the performance signals for the non

    [POWERPC] spufs: avoid accessing kernel memory through mmapped /mem node
    
    I found an exploit in current kernel.
    Currently, there is no range check about mmapping "/mem" node in
    spufs. Thus, an application can access privilege memory region.
    
    In case this kernel already worked on a public server, I send this
    information only here.
    If there are such servers in somewhere, please replace it, ASAP.

    [POWERPC] spu sched: static timeslicing for SCHED_RR contexts
    
    For SCHED_RR tasks we can do some really trivial timeslicing.  Basically
    we fire up a time for every scheduler tick that searches for a higher
    or same priority thread that is on the runqueue and if there is one
    context switches to it.  Because we can't lock spus from timer context
    we actually run this from a delayed runqueue instead of a timer.
    
    A nice optimization would be to skip the actual priority bitmap search
    when there are less contexts than physical spus available.  To implement
    this I need a so far unpublished patch from Andre, and it will be added
    after we have that patch in.
    
    Note that right now we only do the time slicing for SCHED_RR tasks.
    The code would work for SCHED_OTHER tasks aswell, but their prio
    value is defered from the one the PPU thread has at time of spu_run,
    and using this for spu scheduling decisions would make the code very
    unfair.  SCHED_OTHER support will be enabled once we the spu scheduler
    knows how to calculcate cpu_context.prio (very soon)

    [POWERPC] spufs: runqueue simplification
    
    This is the biggest patch in this series, and it reworks the guts of
    the spu scheduler runqueue mechanism:
    
     - instead of embedding a waitqueue in the runqueue there is now a
       simple doubly-linked list, the actual wakeups happen by reusing
       the stop_wq in the spu context (maybe we should rename it one day)
     - spu_free and spu_prio_wakeup are merged into a single spu_reschedule
       function
     - various functionality is split out into small helpers, and kerneldoc
       comments are added in various places to document what's going on.
     - spu_activate is rewritten into a tight loop by removing test for
       various impossible conditions and using the infrastructure in this
       patch.

    [TCP]: Prevent pseudo garbage in SYN's advertized window
    
    TCP may advertize up to 16-bits window in SYN packets (no window
    scaling allowed). At the same time, TCP may have rcv_wnd
    (32-bits) that does not fit to 16-bits without window scaling
    resulting in pseudo garbage into advertized window from the
    low-order bits of rcv_wnd. This can happen at least when
    mss <= (1<<wscale) (see tcp_select_initial_window). This patch
    fixes the handling of SYN advertized windows (compile tested
    only).
    
    In worst case (which is unlikely to occur though), the receiver
    advertized window could be just couple of bytes. I'm not sure
    that such situation would be handled very well at all by the
    receiver!? Fortunately, the situation normalizes after the
    first non-SYN ACK is received because it has the correct,
    scaled window.
    
    Alternatively, tcp_select_initial_window could be changed to
    prevent too large rcv_wnd in the first place.
    
    [ tcp_make_synack() has the same bug, and I've added a fix for
      that to this patch -DaveM ]

    [PATCH] i386: Fix broken CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO on i386
    
    After updating several machines to 2.6.20, I can't boot  anymore the single
    one of them that supports the NX bit and is configured as a 32-bit system.
    
    My understanding is that the VDSO changes in 2.6.20-rc7 were not fully
    cooked, in that with that config option enabled VDSO_SYM(x) now equals
    x, meaning that an address in the fixmap area is now being passed to
    apps via AT_SYSINFO. However, the page is mapped with PAGE_READONLY
    rather than PAGE_READONLY_EXEC.
    
    I'm not certain whether having app code go through the fixmap area is
    intended, but in case it is here is the simple patch that makes things work
    again.

    [PATCH] i386: Rename cpu_gdt_descr and remove extern declaration from smpboot.c
    
    When I implemented the DECLARE_PER_CPU(var) macros, I was careful that
    people couldn't use "var" in a non-percpu context, by prepending
    percpu__.  I never considered that this would allow them to overload
    the same name for a per-cpu and a non-percpu variable.
    
    It is only one of many horrors in the i386 boot code, but let's rename
    the non-perpcu cpu_gdt_descr to early_gdt_descr (not boot_gdt_descr,
    that's something else...)

    [PATCH] i386: paravirt unhandled fallthrough
    
    The current code simply calls "start_kernel" directly if we're under a
    hypervisor and no paravirt_ops backend wants us, because paravirt.c
    registers that as a backend.
    
    This was always a vain hope; start_kernel won't get far without setup.
    It's also impossible for paravirt_ops backends which don't sit in the
    arch/i386/kernel directory: they can't link before paravirt.o anyway.
    
    Keep it simple: if we pass all the registered paravirt probes, BUG().

    [PATCH] i386: Fix Cyrix MediaGX detection
    
    The old Cyrix 5520 CPU detection code relied upon the PCI layer setup being
    done earlier than the CPU setup, which is no longer true.  Fortunately we
    know that if the processor is a MediaGX we can do type 1 pci config
    accesses to check the companion chip.  We thus do those directly and from
    this find the 5520 and implement the workarounds for the timer problem

    Takara then corrected, tested and sent back to the list on 10th January.

    Occasionally the kernel has bugs that result in no irq being found for a

    I've seen my box paralyzed by an endless spew of
    
        rtc: lost some interrupts at 1024Hz.
    
    messages on the serial console.  What seems to be happening is that
    something real causes an interrupt to be lost and triggers the
    message.  But then printing the message to the serial console (from
    the hpet interrupt handler) takes more than 1/1024th of a second, and
    then some more interrupts are lost, so the message triggers again....
    
    Fix this by adding a printk_ratelimit() before printing the warning.

    [PATCH] x86-64: update IO-APIC dest field to 8-bit for xAPIC
    
    On the Unisys ES7000/ONE system, we encountered a problem where performing
    a kexec reboot or dump on any cell other than cell 0 causes the system
    timer to stop working, resulting in a hang during timer calibration in the
    new kernel.
    
    We traced the problem to one line of code in disable_IO_APIC(), which needs
    to restore the timer's IO-APIC configuration before rebooting.  The code is
    currently using the 4-bit physical destination field, rather than using the
    8-bit logical destination field, and it cuts off the upper 4 bits of the
    timer's APIC ID.  If we change this to use the logical destination field,
    the timer works and we can kexec on the upper cells.  This was tested on
    two different cells (0 and 2) in an ES7000/ONE system.
    
    For reference, the relevant Intel xAPIC spec is kept at
    ftp://download.intel.com/design/chipsets/e8501/datashts/30962001.pdf,
    specifically on page 334.

    [PATCH] i386: avoid gcc extension
    
    setcc() in math-emu is written as a gcc extension statement expression
    macro that returns a value.  However, it's not used that way and it's not
    needed like that, so just make it a inline function so that we
    don't use an extension when it's not needed.

    [PATCH] x86: fix laptop bootup hang in init_acpi()
    
    During kernel bootup, a new T60 laptop (CoreDuo, 32-bit) hangs about
    10%-20% of the time in acpi_init():
    
     Calling initcall 0xc055ce1a: topology_init+0x0/0x2f()
     Calling initcall 0xc055d75e: mtrr_init_finialize+0x0/0x2c()
     Calling initcall 0xc05664f3: param_sysfs_init+0x0/0x175()
     Calling initcall 0xc014cb65: pm_sysrq_init+0x0/0x17()
     Calling initcall 0xc0569f99: init_bio+0x0/0xf4()
     Calling initcall 0xc056b865: genhd_device_init+0x0/0x50()
     Calling initcall 0xc056c4bd: fbmem_init+0x0/0x87()
     Calling initcall 0xc056dd74: acpi_init+0x0/0x1ee()
    
    It's a hard hang that not even an NMI could punch through!  Frustratingly,
    adding printks or function tracing to the ACPI code made the hangs go away
    ...
    
    After some time an additional detail emerged: disabling the NMI watchdog
    made these occasional hangs go away.
    
    So i spent the better part of today trying to debug this and trying out
    various theories when i finally found the likely reason for the hang: if
    acpi_ns_initialize_devices() executes an _INI AML method and an NMI
    happens to hit that AML execution in the wrong moment, the machine would
    hang.  (my theory is that this must be some sort of chipset setup method
    doing stores to chipset mmio registers?)
    
    Unfortunately given the characteristics of the hang it was sheer
    impossible to figure out which of the numerous AML methods is impacted
    by this problem.
    
    As a workaround i wrote an interface to disable chipset-based NMIs while
    executing _INI sections - and indeed this fixed the hang.  I did a
    boot-loop of 100 separate reboots and none hung - while without the patch
    it would hang every 5-10 attempts.  Out of caution i did not touch the
    nmi_watchdog=2 case (it's not related to the chipset anyway and didnt
    hang).
    
    I implemented this for both x86_64 and i686, tested the i686 laptop both
    with nmi_watchdog=1 [which triggered the hangs] and nmi_watchdog=2, and
    tested an Athlon64 box with the 64-bit kernel as well. Everything builds
    and works with the patch applied.

    [PATCH] x86-64: x86_64 - Fix FS/GS registers for VT execution
    
    Initialize FS and GS to __KERNEL_DS as well.  The actual value of them is not
    important, but it is important to reload them in protected mode.  At this time,
    they still retain the real mode values from initial boot.  VT disallows
    execution of code under such conditions, which means hardware virtualization
    can not be used to boot the kernel on Intel platforms, making the boot time
    painfully slow.
    
    This requires moving the GS load before the load of GS_BASE, so just move
    all the segments loads there to keep them together in the code.

    [PATCH] x86-64: Allow to run a program when a machine check event is detected
    
    When a machine check event is detected (including a AMD RevF threshold
    overflow event) allow to run a "trigger" program. This allows user space
    to react to such events sooner.
    
    The trigger is configured using a new trigger entry in the
    machinecheck sysfs interface. It is currently shared between
    all CPUs.
    
    I also fixed the AMD threshold handler to run the machine
    check polling code immediately to actually log any events
    that might have caused the threshold interrupt.
    
    Also added some documentation for the mce sysfs interface.

    [PATCH] x86-64: Tighten mce_amd driver MSR reads
    
    while debugging an unrelated problem in Xen, I noticed odd reads from
    non-existent MSRs. Having now found time to look why these happen, I
    came up with below patch, which
    - prevents accessing MCi_MISCj with j > 0 when the block pointer in
    MCi_MISC0 is zero
    - accesses only contiguous MCi_MISCj until a non-implemented one is
    found
    - doesn't touch unimplemented blocks in mce_threshold_interrupt at all
    - gives names to two bits previously derived from MASK_VALID_HI (it
    took me some time to understand the code without this)
    
    The first three items, besides being apparently closer to the spec, should
    namely help cutting down on the time mce_threshold_interrupt() takes.

    [PATCH] x86-64: Fix fake numa for x86_64 machines with big IO hole
    
    This patch resolves the issue of running with numa=fake=X on kernel command
    line on x86_64 machines that have big IO hole.  While calculating the size
    of each node now we look at the total hole size in that range.
    
    Previously there were nodes that only had IO holes in them causing kernel
    boot problems.  We now use the NODE_MIN_SIZE (64MB) as the minimum size of
    memory that any node must have.  We reduce the number of allocated nodes if
    the number of nodes specified on kernel command line results in any node
    getting memory smaller than NODE_MIN_SIZE.
    
    This change allows the extra memory to be incremented in NODE_MIN_SIZE
    granule and uniformly distribute among as many nodes (called big nodes) as
    possible.

    [PATCH] i386: improve sched_clock() on i686
    
    Clean up sched_clock() on i686: it will use the TSC if available and falls
    back to jiffies only if the user asked for it to be disabled via notsc or
    the CPU calibration code didnt figure out the right cpu_khz.
    
    This generally makes the scheduler timestamps more finegrained, on all
    hardware.  (the current scheduler is pretty resistant against asynchronous
    sched_clock() values on different CPUs, it will allow at most up to a jiffy
    of jitter.)
    
    Also simplify sched_clock()'s check for TSC availability: propagate the
    desire and ability to use the TSC into the tsc_disable flag, previously
    this flag only indicated whether the notsc option was passed.  This makes
    the rare low-res sched_clock() codepath a single branch off a read-mostly
    flag.

    [PATCH] i386: add idle notifier
    
    Add a notifier mechanism to the low level idle loop.  You can register a
    callback function which gets invoked on entry and exit from the low level idle
    loop.  The low level idle loop is defined as the polling loop, low-power call,
    or the mwait instruction.  Interrupts processed by the idle thread are not
    considered part of the low level loop.
    
    The notifier can be used to measure precisely how much is spent in useless
    execution (or low power mode).  The perfmon subsystem uses it to turn on/off
    monitoring.

    [PATCH] generic: Break init() in two parts to avoid MODPOST warnings
    
    o init() is a non __init function in .text section but it calls many
      functions which are in .init.text section. Hence MODPOST generates lots
      of cross reference warnings on i386 if compiled with CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y
    
    WARNING: vmlinux - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text:smp_prepare_cpus from .text between 'init' (at offset 0xc0101049) and 'rest_init'
    WARNING: vmlinux - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text:migration_init from .text between 'init' (at offset 0xc010104e) and 'rest_init'
    WARNING: vmlinux - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text:spawn_ksoftirqd from .text between 'init' (at offset 0xc0101053) and 'rest_init'
    
    o This patch breaks down init() in two parts. One part which can go
      in .init.text section and can be freed and other part which has to
      be non __init(init_post()). Now init() calls init_post() and init_post()
      does not call any functions present in .init sections. Hence getting
      rid of warnings.

    [PATCH] i386: vMI timer patches
    
    VMI timer code.  It works by taking over the local APIC clock when APIC is
    configured, which requires a couple hooks into the APIC code.  The backend
    timer code could be commonized into the timer infrastructure, but there are
    some pieces missing (stolen time, in particular), and the exact semantics of
    when to do accounting for NO_IDLE need to be shared between different
    hypervisors as well.  So for now, VMI timer is a separate module.

    [PATCH] i386: paravirt CPU hypercall batching mode
    
    The VMI ROM has a mode where hypercalls can be queued and batched.  This turns
    out to be a significant win during context switch, but must be done at a
    specific point before side effects to CPU state are visible to subsequent
    instructions.  This is similar to the MMU batching hooks already provided.
    The same hooks could be used by the Xen backend to implement a context switch
    multicall.
    
    To explain a bit more about lazy modes in the paravirt patches, basically, the
    idea is that only one of lazy CPU or MMU mode can be active at any given time.
     Lazy MMU mode is similar to this lazy CPU mode, and allows for batching of
    multiple PTE updates (say, inside a remap loop), but to avoid keeping some
    kind of state machine about when to flush cpu or mmu updates, we just allow
    one or the other to be active.  Although there is no real reason a more
    comprehensive scheme could not be implemented, there is also no demonstrated
    need for this extra complexity.

    [PATCH] MM: page allocation hooks for VMI backend
    
    The VMI backend uses explicit page type notification to track shadow page
    tables.  The allocation of page table roots is especially tricky.  We need to
    clone the root for non-PAE mode while it is protected under the pgd lock to
    correctly copy the shadow.
    
    We don't need to allocate pgds in PAE mode, (PDPs in Intel terminology) as
    they only have 4 entries, and are cached entirely by the processor, which
    makes shadowing them rather simple.
    
    For base page table level allocation, pmd_populate provides the exact hook
    point we need.  Also, we need to allocate pages when splitting a large page,
    and we must release pages before returning the page to any free pool.
    
    Despite being required with these slightly odd semantics for VMI, Xen also
    uses these hooks to determine the exact moment when page tables are created or
    released.

    a) In the case of broken MCFG tables on Asus etc., we need to remap 256M
       range, but currently only remap 1M.
    
    b) The base address always corresponds to bus number 0, but currently we
       are assuming it corresponds to start bus number.
    
    This patch fixes the above problems.
    
    (akpm: Arjan suggests that if the MCFG table is broken we just shouldn't use
    it, rather than try to work around things).

    [PATCH] mmconfig: Detect and support the E7520 and the 945G/GZ/P/PL
    
    It seems that the only way to reliably support mmconfig in the presence of
    funky biosen is to detect the hostbridge and read where the window is mapped
    from its registers.  Do that for the E7520 and the 945G/GZ/P/PL for a start.

    unreachable_devices compares between the results of pci configuration accesses

    [PATCH] i386: Convert i386 PDA code to use %fs
    
    Convert the PDA code to use %fs rather than %gs as the segment for
    per-processor data.  This is because some processors show a small but
    measurable performance gain for reloading a NULL segment selector (as %fs
    generally is in user-space) versus a non-NULL one (as %gs generally is).
    
    On modern processors the difference is very small, perhaps undetectable.
    Some old AMD "K6 3D+" processors are noticably slower when %fs is used
    rather than %gs; I have no idea why this might be, but I think they're
    sufficiently rare that it doesn't matter much.
    
    This patch also fixes the math emulator, which had not been adjusted to
    match the changed struct pt_regs.

    [PATCH] x86-64: x86_64-make-the-numa-hash-function-nodemap-allocation fix fix
    
    - Removed an extraneous debug message from allocate_cachealigned_map
    
    - Changed extract_lsb_from_nodes to return 63 for the case where there was
      only one memory node.  The prevents the creation of the dynamic hashmap.
    
    - Changed extract_lsb_from_nodes to use only the starting memory address of
      a node.  On an ES7000, our nodes overlap the starting and ending address,
      meaning, that we see nodes like
    
    	00000 - 10000
    	10000 - 20000
    
      But other systems have nodes whose start and end addresses do not overlap.
       For example:
    
    	00000 - 0FFFF
    	10000 - 1FFFF
    
      In this case, using the ending address will result in an LSB much lower
      than what is possible.  In this case an LSB of 1 when in reality it should
      be 16.

    [PATCH] x86-64: Allocate the NUMA hash function nodemap dynamically
    
    Remove the statically allocated memory to NUMA node hash map in favor of a
    dynamically allocated memory to node hash map (it is cache aligned).
    
    This patch has the nice side effect in that it allows the hash map to grow
    for systems with large amounts of memory (256GB - 1TB), but suffer from
    having small PCI space tacked onto the boot node (which is somewhere
    between 192MB to 512MB on the ES7000).

    [PATCH] x86-64: Add __copy_from_user_nocache
    
    This does user copies in fs write() into the page cache with write combining.
    This pushes the destination out of the CPU's cache, but allows higher bandwidth
    in some case.
    
    The theory is that the page cache data is usually not touched by the
    CPU again and it's better to not pollute the cache with it. Also it is a little
    faster.

    sh: heartbeat consolidation for banked LEDs.
    
    This consolidates the various board heartbeat LED implementations,
    used for strobing the load average across a LED bank. Those boards
    not implementing a full bank can hook in via the LED class.
    
    We leave the compat hook in the machvec for now until those non-banked
    boards are able to migrate to the drivers/leds.

    NFS: disconnect before retrying NFSv4 requests over TCP
    
    RFC3530 section 3.1.1 states an NFSv4 client MUST NOT send a request
    twice on the same connection unless it is the NULL procedure.  Section
    3.1.1 suggests that the client should disconnect and reconnect if it
    wants to retry a request.
    
    Implement this by adding an rpc_clnt flag that an ULP can use to
    specify that the underlying transport should be disconnected on a
    major timeout.  The NFSv4 client asserts this new flag, and requests
    no retries after a minor retransmit timeout.
    
    Note that disconnecting on a retransmit is in general not safe to do
    if the RPC client does not reuse the TCP port number when reconnecting.

    [POWERPC] spufs: Fix bitrot of the SPU mmap facility
    
    It looks like we've had some serious bitrot there mostly due to tracking
    of address_space's of mmap'ed files getting out of sync with the actual
    mmap code. The mfc, mss and psmap were not tracked properly and thus
    not invalidated on context switches (oops !)
    
    I also removed the various file->f_mapping = inode->i_mapping;
    assignments that were done in the other open() routines since that
    is already done for us by __dentry_open.
    
    One improvement we might want to do later is to assign the various
    ctx-> fields at mmap time instead of file open/close time so that we
    don't call unmap_mapping_range() on thing that have not been mmap'ed
    
    Finally, I added some smp_wmb's after assigning the ctx-> fields to make
    sure they are visible to other CPUs. I don't think this is really
    necessary as I suspect locking in the fs layer will make that happen
    anyway but better safe than sorry.

    [POWERPC] spufs: remove need for struct page for SPEs
    
    This patch removes the need for struct page for SPE local store
    and registers from spufs. It also makes the locking much more
    obvious and no longer relying on the truncate logic black magic
    for protecting against races between unmap_mapping_range() and
    new pages faulted in. It does so by switching to a nopfn() handler
    and using the new vm_insert_pfn() to setup the PTEs itself while
    holding a lock on the SPE.
    
    The nice thing is that this patch actually removes a lot more code
    than it adds :-)

      It's premature to refer to them as '52xx'.
    - Specify optional 'model' and 'revision' properties in the soc5200 node
    - Specify reqiured 'cell-index' property to identify between multiple SOC
      devices of the same type.  (Useful for arbitrating shared register access)
    - Specify optional 'port-number' property for adjusting the logical serial

    [POWERPC] Virtual DMA support for floppy driver for new powerpc architecture
    
    During ppc64+ppc merge virtual DMA code for floppy driver was not
    ported.  This patch restores virtual DMA support for floppy in new
    powerpc target.
    
    It is necessary at least on Pegasos and AmigaOne machines for the
    floppy drive to function.  ISA DMA controller works incorrectly there
    due to its addressing limitations.
    
    Virtual DMA mode is activated by floppy=nodma option passed to the
    kernel (or module).  There's no automatic switch like on i386.

    This patch does the following:

    - add DMTEx_IRQ constants for sh4 cpus
    - fix sh7751 DMAE irq number
    
    The SH7780 uses the same IRQs for DMA as other SH4 types, so
    I put the constants on top of the dma.h file.
    
    Other CPU types need to #define their own DMTEx_IRQ contants
    in their appropriate header.

    sh: Lazy dcache writeback optimizations.
    
    This converts the lazy dcache handling to the model described in
    Documentation/cachetlb.txt and drops the ptep_get_and_clear() hacks
    used for the aliasing dcaches on SH-4 and SH7705 in 32kB mode. As a
    bonus, this slightly cuts down on the cache flushing frequency.
    
    With that and the PTEA handling out of the way, the update_mmu_cache()
    implementations can be consolidated, and we no longer have to worry
    about which configuration the cache is in for the SH7705 case.
    
    And finally, explicitly disable the lazy writeback on SMP (SH-4A).

    The iVDR clock enable bit happens to actually reside in a rather

    This fixes up SATA boot for some of the R7780RP boards that didn't
    default-enable the clock in the loader.

    sh: allow earlyprintk baud rate to be set via command line
    
    This allows the baud rate for earlyprintk for sh4 without the
    standard BIOS to be set via the command line. This uses the same
    format as i386 and x86_64, which is:
    
    	earlyprintk=serial,ttySC1,38400
    
    The second parameter (ttySC1 above) is usually the console device
    name or the io address of the serial port. I allow that to be
    specified but ignore it in order to keep the format the same as
    i386/x86_64.

    sh: Use a jump call table for debug trap handlers.
    
    This rips out most of the needlessly complicated sh_bios and kgdb
    trap handling, and forces it all through a common fast dispatch path.
    As more debug traps are inserted, it's important to keep them in sync
    for all of the parts, not just SH-3/4.
    
    As the SH-2 parts are unable to do traps in the >= 0x40 range, we
    restrict the debug traps to the 0x30-0x3f range on all parts, and
    also bump the kgdb breakpoint trap down in to this range (from 0xff
    to 0x3c) so it's possible to use for nommu.
    
    Optionally, this table can be padded out to catch spurious traps for
    SH-3/4, but we don't do that yet..

    IB/mthca: Always fill MTTs from CPU
    
    Speed up memory registration by filling in MTTs directly when the CPU
    can write directly to the whole table (all mem-free cards, and to
    Tavor mode on 64-bit systems with the patch I posted earlier).  This
    reduces the number of FW commands needed to register an MR by at least
    a factor of 2 and speeds up memory registration significantly.

    IB/mthca: Merge MR and FMR space on 64-bit systems
    
    For Tavor, we currently reserve separate MPT and MTT space for FMRs to
    avoid abusing the vmalloc space on 32 bit kernels. No such problem
    exists on 64 bit kernels so let's not do it there.
    
    This way we have a shared pool for MR and FMR resources, used on
    demand.  This will also make it possible to write MTTs for regular
    regions directly from driver.

    IB/mthca: Fix access to MTT and MPT tables on non-cache-coherent CPUs
    
    We allocate the MTT table with alloc_pages() and then do pci_map_sg(),
    so we must call pci_dma_sync_sg() after the CPU writes to the MTT
    table.  This works since the device will never write MTTs on mem-free
    HCAs, once we get rid of the use of the WRITE_MTT firmware command.
    This change is needed to make that work, and is an improvement for
    now, since it gives FMRs a chance at working.
    
    For MPTs, both the device and CPU might write there, so we must
    allocate DMA coherent memory for these.

    [NETFILTER]: ip6t_mh: drop piggyback payload packet on MH packets
    
    Regarding RFC3775, MH payload proto field should be IPPROTO_NONE. Otherwise
    it must be discarded (and the receiver should send ICMP error).
    
    We assume filter should drop such piggyback everytime to disallow slipping
    through firewall rules, even the final receiver will discard it.

    [PATCH] mark struct file_operations const 1
    
    Many struct file_operations in the kernel can be "const".  Marking them const
    moves these to the .rodata section, which avoids false sharing with potential
    dirty data.  In addition it'll catch accidental writes at compile time to
    these shared resources.

    [PATCH] ps3: Virtual Frame Buffer Driver
    
    Add the PS3 Virtual Frame Buffer Driver.
    
    As the actual graphics hardware cannot be accessed directly by Linux, ps3fb
    uses a virtual frame buffer in main memory.  The actual screen image is copied
    to graphics memory by the GPU on every vertical blank, by making a hypervisor
    call.

    [PATCH] ps3: Preallocate bootmem memory for ps3fb
    
    Preallocate bootmem memory for the PS3 frame buffer device, which needs a
    large block of physically-contiguous memory. The size of this memory block is
    configurable:
      - The config option CONFIG_FB_PS3_DEFAULT_SIZE_M allows to specify the
        default amount of memory (in MiB) allocated to the virtual frame buffer.
      - The early boot parameter `ps3fb=xxx' allows to override the default value.
        It will be rounded up to a multiple of 1 MiB, if needed.

    [PATCH] fb_videomode_to_var: reset virtual screen parameters
    
    fb_videomode_to_var(): reset the virtual screen parameters when converting
    from an fb_videomode to an fb_var_screeninfo.
    
    Without this the old virtual screen parameters are kept.  Hence you cannot
    switch to a video mode with a lower resolution on frame buffer devices that
    don't support virtual screens and panning, as values are not supposed to be
    rounded down when they don't fit.
    
    I also reordered the assignments to match the order of the individual members.

    Drivers that had been marked as BROKEN for such a long time seem to be

    But if anyone wants to ever revive this driver, the code is still

    [PATCH] tgafb: support the DirectColor visual
    
     The 32-plane variations of the TGA use the Bt463 RAMDAC and are therefore
    DirectColor rather than TrueColor adapters.  This is a set of changes to
    implement the necessary bits to support this model.  A couple of fixes to fix
    accesses to the RAMDAC are included as a side-effect.

    [PATCH] remove broken video drivers
    
    Remove some video drivers that:
    
    - had already been marked as BROKEN in 2.6.0 three years ago and
    - are still marked as BROKEN.
    
    These are the following drivers:
    - FB_CYBER
    - FB_VIRGE
    - FB_RETINAZ3
    - FB_SUN3
    
    Drivers that had been marked as BROKEN for such a long time seem to be
    unlikely to be revived in the forseeable future.
    
    But if anyone wants to ever revive any of these drivers, the code is
    still present in the older kernel releases.

    [PATCH] hotplug: Allow modules to use the cpu hotplug notifiers even if !CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU
    
    The following patchset allows a host with running virtual machines to be
    suspended and, on at least a subset of the machines tested, resumed.  Note
    that this is orthogonal to suspending and resuming an individual guest to a
    file.
    
    A side effect of implementing suspend/resume is that cpu hotplug is now
    supported.  This should please the owners of big iron.
    
    This patch:
    
    KVM wants the cpu hotplug notifications, both for cpu hotplug itself, but more
    commonly for host suspend/resume.
    
    In order to avoid extensive #ifdefs, provide stubs when CONFIG_CPU_HOTPLUG is
    not defined.
    
    In all, we have four cases:
    
    - UP: register and unregister stubbed out
    - SMP+hotplug: full register and unregister
    - SMP, no hotplug, core: register as __init, unregister stubbed
          (cpus are brought up during core initialization)
    - SMP, no hotplug, module: register and unregister stubbed out
          (cpus cannot be brought up during module lifetime)

    [PATCH] ufs2 write: mount as rw
    
    These series of patches add UFS2 write-support.  UFS2 - is default file system
    for recent versions of FreeBSD.
    
    The main differences from UFS1 from write support point of view
    are:
    1)Not all inodes are allocated during formatation of disk.
    2)All meta-data(pointer to data blocks) are 64bit(in UFS1 they
    are 32bit).
    
    So patch series consist of
    1)make possible mount UFS2 in read-write mode
    2)code to write ufs2 inodes and code to initialize inodes chunks.
    3)work with 64bit meta-data
    
    I made simple testing like create/deleting/writing/reading/truncating, also I
    ran fsx-linux and untar and build kernel on UFS1 and UFS2, after that FreeBSD
    fsck do not find any errors in fs.
    
    This patch makes possible to mount ufs2 "rw", and updates UFS2 documentation:
    remove note about bug(it fixed by reallocate blocks on the fly patch) and add
    me in the list of people who want receive bug reports.

    [PATCH] Dynamic kernel command-line: common
    
    Current implementation stores a static command-line buffer allocated to
    COMMAND_LINE_SIZE size.  Most architectures stores two copies of this buffer,
    one for future reference and one for parameter parsing.
    
    Current kernel command-line size for most architecture is much too small for
    module parameters, video settings, initramfs paramters and much more.  The
    problem is that setting COMMAND_LINE_SIZE to a grater value, allocates static
    buffers.
    
    In order to allow a greater command-line size, these buffers should be
    dynamically allocated or marked as init disposable buffers, so unused memory
    can be released.
    
    This patch renames the static saved_command_line variable into
    boot_command_line adding __initdata attribute, so that it can be disposed
    after initialization.  This rename is required so applications that use
    saved_command_line will not be affected by this change.
    
    It reintroduces saved_command_line as dynamically allocated buffer to match
    the data in boot_command_line.
    
    It also mark secondary command-line buffer as __initdata, and copies it to
    dynamically allocated static_command_line buffer components may hold reference
    to it after initialization.
    
    This patch is for linux-2.6.20-rc4-mm1 and is divided to target each
    architecture.  I could not check this in any architecture so please forgive me
    if I got it wrong.
    
    The per-architecture modification is very simple, use boot_command_line in
    place of saved_command_line.  The common code is the change into dynamic
    command-line.
    
    This patch:
    
    1. Rename saved_command_line into boot_command_line, mark as init
       disposable.
    
    2. Add dynamic allocated saved_command_line.
    
    3. Add dynamic allocated static_command_line.
    
    4. During startup copy: boot_command_line into saved_command_line.  arch
       command_line into static_command_line.
    
    5. Parse static_command_line and not arch command_line, so arch
       command_line may be freed.

    [PATCH] sched: avoid div in rebalance_tick
    
    Avoid expensive integer divide 3 times per CPU per tick.
    
    A userspace test of this loop went from 26ns, down to 19ns on a G5; and
    from 123ns down to 28ns on a P3.
    
    (Also avoid a variable bit shift, as suggested by Alan. The effect
    of this wasn't noticable on the CPUs I tested with).

    [PATCH] eCryptfs: convert f_op->write() to vfs_write()
    
    sys_write() takes a local copy of f_pos and writes that back
    into the struct file. It does this so that two concurrent write()
    callers don't make a mess of f_pos, and of the file contents.
    
    ecryptfs should be calling vfs_write().  That way we also get the fsnotify
    notifications, which ecryptfs presently appears to have subverted.
    
    Convert direct calls to f_op->write() into calls to vfs_write().

    [PATCH] eCryptfs: xattr flags and mount options
    
    This patch set introduces the ability to store cryptographic metadata into an
    lower file extended attribute rather than the lower file header region.
    
    This patch set implements two new mount options:
    
    ecryptfs_xattr_metadata
     - When set, newly created files will have their cryptographic
       metadata stored in the extended attribute region of the file rather
       than the header.
    
       When storing the data in the file header, there is a minimum of 8KB
       reserved for the header information for each file, making each file at
       least 12KB in size.  This can take up a lot of extra disk space if the user
       creates a lot of small files.  By storing the data in the extended
       attribute, each file will only occupy at least of 4KB of space.
    
       As the eCryptfs metadata set becomes larger with new features such as
       multi-key associations, most popular filesystems will not be able to store
       all of the information in the xattr region in some cases due to space
       constraints.  However, the majority of users will only ever associate one
       key per file, so most users will be okay with storing their data in the
       xattr region.
    
       This option should be used with caution.  I want to emphasize that the
       xattr must be maintained under all circumstances, or the file will be
       rendered permanently unrecoverable.  The last thing I want is for a user to
       forget to set an xattr flag in a backup utility, only to later discover
       that their backups are worthless.
    
    ecryptfs_encrypted_view
     - When set, this option causes eCryptfs to present applications a
       view of encrypted files as if the cryptographic metadata were
       stored in the file header, whether the metadata is actually stored
       in the header or in the extended attributes.
    
       No matter what eCryptfs winds up doing in the lower filesystem, I want
       to preserve a baseline format compatibility for the encrypted files.  As of
       right now, the metadata may be in the file header or in an xattr.  There is
       no reason why the metadata could not be put in a separate file in future
       versions.
    
       Without the compatibility mode, backup utilities would have to know to
       back up the metadata file along with the files.  The semantics of eCryptfs
       have always been that the lower files are self-contained units of encrypted
       data, and the only additional information required to decrypt any given
       eCryptfs file is the key.  That is what has always been emphasized about
       eCryptfs lower files, and that is what users expect.  Providing the
       encrypted view option will provide a way to userspace applications wherein
       they can always get to the same old familiar eCryptfs encrypted files,
       regardless of what eCryptfs winds up doing with the metadata behind the
       scenes.
    
    This patch:
    
    Add extended attribute support to version bit vector, flags to indicate when
    xattr or encrypted view modes are enabled, and support for the new mount
    options.

    [PATCH] eCryptfs: Public key transport mechanism
    
    This is the transport code for public key functionality in eCryptfs.  It
    manages encryption/decryption request queues with a transport mechanism.
    Currently, netlink is the only implemented transport.
    
    Each inode has a unique File Encryption Key (FEK).  Under passphrase, a File
    Encryption Key Encryption Key (FEKEK) is generated from a salt/passphrase
    combo on mount.  This FEKEK encrypts each FEK and writes it into the header of
    each file using the packet format specified in RFC 2440.  This is all
    symmetric key encryption, so it can all be done via the kernel crypto API.
    
    These new patches introduce public key encryption of the FEK.  There is no
    asymmetric key encryption support in the kernel crypto API, so eCryptfs pushes
    the FEK encryption and decryption out to a userspace daemon.  After
    considering our requirements and determining the complexity of using various
    transport mechanisms, we settled on netlink for this communication.
    
    eCryptfs stores authentication tokens into the kernel keyring.  These tokens
    correlate with individual keys.  For passphrase mode of operation, the
    authentication token contains the symmetric FEKEK.  For public key, the
    authentication token contains a PKI type and an opaque data blob managed by
    individual PKI modules in userspace.
    
    Each user who opens a file under an eCryptfs partition mounted in public key
    mode must be running a daemon.  That daemon has the user's credentials and has
    access to all of the keys to which the user should have access.  The daemon,
    when started, initializes the pluggable PKI modules available on the system
    and registers itself with the eCryptfs kernel module.  Userspace utilities
    register public key authentication tokens into the user session keyring.
    These authentication tokens correlate key signatures with PKI modules and PKI
    blobs.  The PKI blobs contain PKI-specific information necessary for the PKI
    module to carry out asymmetric key encryption and decryption.
    
    When the eCryptfs module parses the header of an existing file and finds a Tag
    1 (Public Key) packet (see RFC 2440), it reads in the public key identifier
    (signature).  The asymmetrically encrypted FEK is in the Tag 1 packet;
    eCryptfs puts together a decrypt request packet containing the signature and
    the encrypted FEK, then it passes it to the daemon registered for the
    current->euid via a netlink unicast to the PID of the daemon, which was
    registered at the time the daemon was started by the user.
    
    The daemon actually just makes calls to libecryptfs, which implements request
    packet parsing and manages PKI modules.  libecryptfs grabs the public key
    authentication token for the given signature from the user session keyring.
    This auth tok tells libecryptfs which PKI module should receive the request.
    libecryptfs then makes a decrypt() call to the PKI module, and it passes along
    the PKI block from the auth tok.  The PKI uses the blob to figure out how it
    should decrypt the data passed to it; it performs the decryption and passes
    the decrypted data back to libecryptfs.  libecryptfs then puts together a
    reply packet with the decrypted FEK and passes that back to the eCryptfs
    module.
    
    The eCryptfs module manages these request callouts to userspace code via
    message context structs.  The module maintains an array of message context
    structs and places the elements of the array on two lists: a free and an
    allocated list.  When eCryptfs wants to make a request, it moves a msg ctx
    from the free list to the allocated list, sets its state to pending, and fires
    off the message to the user's registered daemon.
    
    When eCryptfs receives a netlink message (via the callback), it correlates the
    msg ctx struct in the alloc list with the data in the message itself.  The
    msg->index contains the offset of the array of msg ctx structs.  It verifies
    that the registered daemon PID is the same as the PID of the process that sent
    the message.  It also validates a sequence number between the received packet
    and the msg ctx.  Then, it copies the contents of the message (the reply
    packet) into the msg ctx struct, sets the state in the msg ctx to done, and
    wakes up the process that was sleeping while waiting for the reply.
    
    The sleeping process was whatever was performing the sys_open().  This process
    originally called ecryptfs_send_message(); it is now in
    ecryptfs_wait_for_response().  When it wakes up and sees that the msg ctx
    state was set to done, it returns a pointer to the message contents (the reply
    packet) and returns.  If all went well, this packet contains the decrypted
    FEK, which is then copied into the crypt_stat struct, and life continues as
    normal.
    
    The case for creation of a new file is very similar, only instead of a decrypt
    request, eCryptfs sends out an encrypt request.
    
    > - We have a great clod of key mangement code in-kernel.  Why is that
    >   not suitable (or growable) for public key management?
    
    eCryptfs uses Howells' keyring to store persistent key data and PKI state
    information.  It defers public key cryptographic transformations to userspace
    code.  The userspace data manipulation request really is orthogonal to key
    management in and of itself.  What eCryptfs basically needs is a secure way to
    communicate with a particular daemon for a particular task doing a syscall,
    based on the UID.  Nothing running under another UID should be able to access
    that channel of communication.
    
    > - Is it appropriate that new infrastructure for public key
    > management be private to a particular fs?
    
    The messaging.c file contains a lot of code that, perhaps, could be extracted
    into a separate kernel service.  In essence, this would be a sort of
    request/reply mechanism that would involve a userspace daemon.  I am not aware
    of anything that does quite what eCryptfs does, so I was not aware of any
    existing tools to do just what we wanted.
    
    >   What happens if one of these daemons exits without sending a quit
    >   message?
    
    There is a stale uid<->pid association in the hash table for that user.  When
    the user registers a new daemon, eCryptfs cleans up the old association and
    generates a new one.  See ecryptfs_process_helo().
    
    > - _why_ does it use netlink?
    
    Netlink provides the transport mechanism that would minimize the complexity of
    the implementation, given that we can have multiple daemons (one per user).  I
    explored the possibility of using relayfs, but that would involve having to
    introduce control channels and a protocol for creating and tearing down
    channels for the daemons.  We do not have to worry about any of that with
    netlink.

    contains an IPv4 address.  Top among these are error and debugging messages
    that display the server's IP address.
    
    Let's refactor the address printing into a separate function that's smart
    enough to figure out the difference between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

    Rather than calling svc_sock_enqueue at the end of svc_setup_socket, we now

    Sometimes we need to create an RPC service but not register it with the local

    Change the svc_makesock() API to allow optionally creating temporary or

    [PATCH] Workaround CAPI subsystem locking issue
    
    I think the following patch should go into the kernel, until the ISDN/CAPI
    guys create the real fix for this issue.
    
    The issue is a concurrency issue with some internal CAPI data structure
    which can crash the kernel.
    
    On my FritzCard DSL with the AVM driver it crashes about once a day without
    this workaround patch.  With this workaround patch it's rock-stable (at
    least on UP, but I don't see why this shouldn't work on SMP as well.  But
    maybe I'm missing something.)
    
    This workaround is kind of a sledgehammer which inserts a global lock to
    wrap around all the critical sections.  Of course, this is a scalability
    issue, if you have many ISDN/CAPI cards.  But it prevents a crash.  So I
    vote for this fix to get merged, until people come up with a better
    solution.  Better have a stable kernel that's less scalable, than a
    crashing and useless kernel.
    
    This bug is in the kernel since 2.6.15 (at least).

    [PATCH] GPIO core
    
    This defines a simple and minimalist programming interface for GPIO APIs:
    
      - Documentation/gpio.txt ... describes things (read it)
    
      - include/asm-arm/gpio.h ... defines the ARM hook, which just punts
        to <asm/arch/gpio.h> for any implementation
    
      - include/asm-generic/gpio.h ... implement "can sleep" variants as calling
        the normal ones, for systems that don't handle i2c expanders.
    
    The immediate need for such a cross-architecture API convention is to support
    drivers that work the same on AT91 ARM and AVR32 AP7000 chips, which embed many
    of the same controllers but have different CPUs.  However, several other users
    have been reported, including a driver for a hardware watchdog chip and some
    handhelds.org multi-CPU button drivers.

    [PATCH] EDAC: Add memory scrubbing controls API to core
    
    This is an attempt of providing an interface for memory scrubbing control in
    EDAC.
    
    This patch modifies the EDAC Core to provide the Interface for memory
    controller modules to implment.
    
    The following things are still outstanding:
    
     - K8 is the first implemenation,
    
       The patch provide a method of configuring the K8 hardware memory scrubber
       via the 'mcX' sysfs directory.  There should be some fallback to a generic
       scrubber implemented in software if the hardware does not support
       scrubbing.
    
       Or .. the scrubbing sysfs entry should not be visible at all.
    
     - Only works with SDRAM, not cache,
    
       The K8 can scrub cache and l2cache also - but I think this is not so
       useful as the cache is busy all the time (one hopes).
    
       One would also expect that cache scrubbing requires hardware support.
    
     - Error Handling,
    
       I would like that errors are returned to the user in "terms of file
       system".
    
     - Presentation,
    
       I chose Bandwidth in Bytes/Second as a representation of the scrubbing
       rate for the following reasons:
    
       I like that the sysfs entries are sort-of textual, related to something
       that makes sense instead of magical values that must be looked up.
    
       "My People" wants "% main memory scrubbed per hour" others prefer "%
       memory bandwidth used" as representation, "bandwith used" makes it easy to
       calculate both versions in one-liner scripts.
    
       If one later wants to scrub cache, the scaling becomes wierd for K8
       changing from "blocks of 64 byte memory" to "blocks of 64 cache lines" to
       "blocks of 64 bit".  Using "bandwidth used" makes sense in all three cases,
       (I.M.O.  anyway ;-).
    
     - Discovery,
    
       There is no way to discover the possible settings and what they do
       without reading the code and the documentation.
    
       *I* do not know how to make that work in a practical way.
    
     - Bugs(??),
    
       other tools can set invalid values in the memory scrub control register,
       those will read back as '-1', requiring the user to reset the scrub rate.
       This is how *I* think it should be.
    
     - Afflicting other areas of code,
    
       I made changes to edac_mc.c and edac_mc.h which will show up globally -
       this is not nice, it would be better that the memory scrubbing fuctionality
       and interface could be entirely contained within the memory controller it

    [PATCH] EDAC: e752x byte access fix
    
    The reading of the DRA registers should be a byte at a time (one register at a
    time) instead of 4 bytes at a time (four registers).  Reading a dword at a
    time retrieves erroneous information from all but the first register.  A
    change was made to read in each register in a loop prior to using the data in
    those registers.

    [PATCH] tty: update the tty layer to work with struct pid
    
    Of kernel subsystems that work with pids the tty layer is probably the largest
    consumer.  But it has the nice virtue that the assiation with a session only
    lasts until the session leader exits.  Which means that no reference counting
    is required.  So using struct pid winds up being a simple optimization to
    avoid hash table lookups.
    
    In the long term the use of pid_nr also ensures that when we have multiple pid
    spaces mixed everything will work correctly.

    [PATCH] pid: replace is_orphaned_pgrp with is_current_pgrp_orphaned
    
    Every call to is_orphaned_pgrp passed in process_group(current) which is racy
    with respect to another thread changing our process group.  It didn't bite us
    because we were dealing with integers and the worse we would get would be a
    stale answer.
    
    In switching the checks to use struct pid to be a little more efficient and
    prepare the way for pid namespaces this race became apparent.
    
    So I simplified the calls to the more specialized is_current_pgrp_orphaned so
    I didn't have to worry about making logic changes to avoid the race.

    [PATCH] pid: make session_of_pgrp use struct pid instead of pid_t
    
    To properly implement a pid namespace I need to deal exclusively in terms of
    struct pid, because pid_t values become ambiguous.
    
    To this end session_of_pgrp is transformed to take and return a struct pid
    pointer.  To avoid the need to worry about reference counting I now require my
    caller to hold the appropriate locks.  Leaving callers repsonsible for
    increasing the reference count if they need access to the result outside of
    the locks.
    
    Since session_of_pgrp currently only has one caller and that caller simply
    uses only test the result for equality with another process group, the locking
    change means I don't actually have to acquire the tasklist_lock at all.
    
    tiocspgrp is also modified to take and release the lock.  The logic there is a
    little more complicated but nothing I won't need when I convert pgrp of a tty
    to a struct pid pointer.

    [PATCH] tty: make __proc_set_tty static
    
    The aim of this patch set is to start wrapping up the struct pid conversions.
    As such this patchset culminates with the removal of kill_pg, kill_pg_info,
    __kill_pg_info, do_each_task_pid, and while_each_task_pid.
    
    kill_proc, daemonize, and kernel_thread are still in my sights but there is
    still work to get to them.
    
    The first three are basic cleanups around disassociate_ctty, while working on
    converting it I found several issues.  tty_old_pgrp can be a tricky concept to
    wrap your head around.
    
     1 tty: Make __proc_set_tty static.
     2 tty: Clarify disassociate_ctty
     3 tty: Fix the locking for signal->session in disassociate_ctty
    
    These just stop using the old helper functions.
    
     4 signal: Use kill_pgrp not kill_pg in the sunos compatibility code.
     5 signal: Rewrite kill_something_info so it uses newer helpers.
    
    Then the grind to convert the tty layer and all of it's helper functions to
    struct pid.
    
     6 pid: Make session_of_pgrp use struct pid instead of pid_t.
     7 pid: Use struct pid for talking about process groups in exit.c
     8 pid: Replace is_orphaned_pgrp with is_current_pgrp_orphaned
     9 tty: Update the tty layer to work with struct pid.
    
    A final helper function update.
    
    10 pid: Replace do/while_each_task_pid with do/while_each_pid_task
    
    And the removal of the functions that are now unused.
    11 pid: Remove now unused do_each_task_pid and while_each_task_pid
    12 pid: Remove the now unused kill_pg kill_pg_info and __kill_pg_info
    
    All of these should be fairly simple and to the point.
    
    This patch:
    
    Currently all users of __proc_set_tty are in tty_io.c so make the function
    static.

    [PATCH] RTC gets sysfs wakealarm attribute
    
    This adds a new "wakealarm" sysfs attribute to RTC class devices which support
    alarm operations and are wakeup-capable:
    
     - It reads as either empty, or the scheduled alarm time as seconds
       since the POSIX epoch.  (That time may already have passed, since
       nothing currently enforces one-shot alarm semantics.)
    
     - It can be written with an alarm time in the future, again seconds
       since the POSIX epoch, which enables the alarm.
    
     - It can be written with an alarm time not in the future (such as 0,
       the start of the POSIX epoch) to disable the alarm.
    
    Usage examples (some need GNU date) after "cd /sys/class/rtc/rtcN":
    
        alarm after 10 minutes:
    	# echo $(( $(cat since_epoch) + 10 * 60 )) > wakealarm
        alarm tuesday evening 10pm:
    	# date -d '10pm tuesday' "+%s" > wakealarm
        disable alarm:
        	# echo 0 > wakealarm
    
    This resembles the /proc/acpi/alarm file in that nothing happens when the
    alarm triggers ...  except possibly waking the system from sleep.  It's also
    like that in a nasty way: not much can be done to prevent one task from
    clobbering another task's alarm settings.
    
    It differs from that file in that there's no in-kernel date parser.
    
    Note that a few RTCs ignore rtc_wkalrm.enabled when setting alarms, or aren't
    set up correctly, so they won't yet behave with this attribute.

    [PATCH] spi_bitbang(): use overridable setup_transfer() method
    
    A small bug-fix for spi_bitbang: it must always call the setup_transfer
    function via the overridable pointer, not assume that its
    spi_bitbang_setup_transfer is sufficient.  Otherwise, if all options in the
    transfers are default (0), the overrided function will never be called.
    
    Granted, the function replacing it must call spi_bitbang_setup_transfer,
    but it might also have other important things to do, even if the second
    argument (the spi_transfer) is NULL.  Tested together with the other
    patches on the spi_crisv32_sser and spi_crisv32_gpio drivers (not yet in
    the kernel, will IIUC be submitted as part of the usual
    arch-maintainer-pushes).

    [PATCH] spi: remove return in spi_unregister_driver()
    
    Make the spi_unregister_driver() code fit in with the rest of the header
    file, and only do the action if the driver passed is non-NULL.
    
    This also makes the code a line smaller.

    [PATCH] SPI: Freescale iMX SPI controller driver (BIS+)
    
    Add the SPI controller driver for Freescale i.MX(S/L/1).
    Main features summary:
    
     > Per chip setup via board specific code and/or protocol driver.
     > Per transfer setup.
     > PIO transfers.
     > DMA transfers.
     > Managing of NULL tx / rx buffer for rd only / wr only transfers.
    
    This patch replace patch-2.6.20-rc4-spi_imx with the following changes:
     > Few cosmetic changes.
     > Function map_dma_buffers now return 0 for success and -1 for failure.
     > Solved a bug inside spi_imx_probe function (wrong error path).
     > Solved a bug inside setup function (bad undo setup for max_speed_hz).
     > For read-only transfers, always write zero bytes.
    
    This is almost the same as the 'BIS' version sent by Andrea, except for
    updating the 'DUMMY' byte so that read-only transfers shift out zeroes.
    That part of the API changed recently, since some half duplex peripheral
    chips require that semantic.

    [PATCH] SPI controller driver for OMAP Microwire
    
    This adds a SPI driver for the Microwire controller on OMAP1 chips.  This
    driver has been used in the Linux-OMAP tree for some time now, including
    with some of those displays using standardized 9-bit commands followed by
    data with 8-bit words.
    
    Microwire only supports half duplex transfers, but that's all that most SPI
    protocols need.  When full duplex, or higher speeds, are needed there are
    several other controllers that can be used on OMAP.

    [PATCH] FS: speed up rw_verify_area()
    
    oprofile hunting showed a stall in rw_verify_area(), because of triple
    indirection and potential cache misses.
    (file->f_path.dentry->d_inode->i_flock)
    
    By moving initialization of 'struct inode' pointer before the pos/count
    sanity tests, we allow the compiler and processor to perform two loads by
    anticipation, reducing stall, without prefetch() hints.  Even x86 arch has
    enough registers to not use temporary variables and not increase text size.
    
    I validated this patch running a bench and studied oprofile changes, and
    absolute perf of the test program.
    
    Results of my epoll_pipe_bench (source available on request) on a Pentium-M
    1.6 GHz machine
    
    Before :
    # ./epoll_pipe_bench -l 30 -t 20
    Avg: 436089 evts/sec read_count=8843037 write_count=8843040 21.218390 samples
    per call
    (best value out of 10 runs)
    
    After :
    # ./epoll_pipe_bench -l 30 -t 20
    Avg: 470980 evts/sec read_count=9549871 write_count=9549894 21.216694 samples
    per call
    (best value out of 10 runs)
    
    oprofile CPU_CLK_UNHALTED events gave a reduction from 5.3401 % to 2.5851 %
    for the rw_verify_area() function.

    [PATCH] warning fix: unsigned->signed
    
    While compiling my code with -Wconversion using gcc-trunk, I always get a
    bunch of warrning from headers, here is fix for them:
    
    __getblk is alawys called with unsigned argument,
    but it takes signed, the same story with __bread,__breadahead and so on.

    [PATCH] ipc: save the ipc namespace while reading proc files
    
    The problem we were assuming that current->nsproxy->ipc_ns would never
    change while someone has our file in /proc/sysvipc/ file open.  Given that
    this can change with both unshare and by passing the file descriptor to
    another process that assumption is occasionally wrong.
    
    Therefore this patch causes /proc/sysvipc/* to cache the namespace and
    increment it's count when we open the file and to decrement the count when
    we close the file, ensuring consistent operation with no surprises.

    [PATCH] kernel: shut up the IRQ mismatch messages
    
    The problem is various drivers legally validly and sensibly try to claim
    IRQs but the kernel insists on vomiting forth a giant irrelevant debugging
    spew when the types clash.
    
    Edit kernel/irq/manage.c go down to mismatch: in setup_irq() and ifdef out
    the if clause that checks for mismatches.  It'll then just do the right
    thing and work sanely.
    
    For the current -mm kernel this will do the trick (and moves it into shared
    irq debugging as in debug mode the info spew is useful).  I've had a
    variant of this in my private tree for some time as I got fed up on the
    mess on boxes where old legacy IRQs get reused.

    [PATCH] inotify: read return val fix
    
    Fix for inotify read bug (bugzilla.kernel.org #6999)
    
    Problem Description:
    When reading from an inotify device with an insufficient sized buffer, read(2)
    will return 0 with no errno set. This is because of an logically incorrect
    action from the user program thus should return an more logical value. My
    suggestion is return -EINVAL as for bind(2).
    
    This patch is based on the proposal from Ryan <wolf0403@hotmail.com>, and
    feedback from John McCutchan <john@johnmccutchan.com>.
    
    Return -EINVAL if we have not passed in enough buffer space to read a single
    inotify event, rather than 0 which indicates that there is nothing to read.

    Iterate over sb->s_inodes instead of sb->s_files in add_dquot_ref.  This
    reduces list search and lock hold time aswell as getting rid of one of the
    few uses of file_list_lock which Ingo identified as a scalability problem.
    
    Previously we called dq_op->initialize for every inode handing of a
    writeable file that wasn't initialized before.  Now we're calling it for
    every inode that has a non-zero i_writecount, aka a writeable file
    descriptor refering to it.

    [PATCH] Fix d_path for lazy unmounts
    
    Here is a bugfix to d_path.
    
    First, when d_path() hits a lazily unmounted mount point, it tries to
    prepend the name of the lazily unmounted dentry to the path name.  It gets
    this wrong, and also overwrites the slash that separates the name from the
    following pathname component.  This is demonstrated by the attached test
    case, which prints "getcwd returned d_path-bugsubdir" with the bug.  The
    correct result would be "getcwd returned d_path-bug/subdir".
    
    It could be argued that the name of the root dentry should not be part of
    the result of d_path in the first place.  On the other hand, what the
    unconnected namespace was once reachable as may provide some useful hints
    to users, and so that seems okay.
    
    Second, it isn't always possible to tell from the __d_path result whether
    the specified root and rootmnt (i.e., the chroot) was reached: lazy
    unmounts of bind mounts will produce a path that does start with a
    non-slash so we can tell from that, but other lazy unmounts will produce a
    path that starts with a slash, just like "ordinary" paths.
    
    The attached patch cleans up __d_path() to fix the bug with overlapping
    pathname components.  It also adds a @fail_deleted argument, which allows
    to get rid of some of the mess in sys_getcwd().  Grabbing the dcache_lock
    can then also be moved into __d_path().  The patch also makes sure that
    paths will only start with a slash for paths which are connected to the
    root and rootmnt.
    
    The @fail_deleted argument could be added to d_path() as well: this would
    allow callers to recognize deleted files, without having to resort to the
    ambiguous check for the " (deleted)" string at the end of the pathnames.
    This is not currently done, but it might be worthwhile.

    [PATCH] Make BH_Unwritten a first class bufferhead flag V2
    
    Currently, XFS uses BH_PrivateStart for flagging unwritten extent state in a
    bufferhead.  Recently, I found the long standing mmap/unwritten extent
    conversion bug, and it was to do with partial page invalidation not clearing
    the unwritten flag from bufferheads attached to the page but beyond EOF.  See
    here for a full explaination:
    
    http://oss.sgi.com/archives/xfs/2006-12/msg00196.html
    
    The solution I have checked into the XFS dev tree involves duplicating code
    from block_invalidatepage to clear the unwritten flag from the bufferhead(s),
    and then calling block_invalidatepage() to do the rest.
    
    Christoph suggested that this would be better solved by pushing the unwritten
    flag into the common buffer head flags and just adding the call to
    discard_buffer():
    
    http://oss.sgi.com/archives/xfs/2006-12/msg00239.html
    
    The following patch makes BH_Unwritten a first class citizen.

    [S390] cio: Fixup interface for setting options on ccw devices.
    
    The current ccw_device_set_options() sets a specified mask of options
    and clears those not specified, but there is no way to find out which
    options have already been set.
    
    In order to fix this up, introduce the following interface changes:
    
    ccw_device_set_options() now only sets the specified bits, but does
    not clear those that are not specified.
    
    ccw_device_clear_options() clears the specified bits.
    
    ccw_device_set_options_mask() provides the old semantics (setting only
    the specified bits and clearing the others).
    
    Device drivers now work as expected. qdio has been adapted.

    dmabounce keeps a per-device structure, and finds the correct
    structure by walking a list.  Since architectures can now add
    fields to struct device, we can attach this structure direct to
    the struct device, thereby eliminating the code to search the
    list.

    [PATCH] Switch s390 to NO_IOMEM
    
    Martin Schwidefsky wrote:
      "s390 does not even need (in|out)b(_p|).  I wondered what else from
       io.h do we not need.  The answer is: almost nothing.  With the devres
       patch from Al and the dma-mapping patch from Heiko we can get rid of
       iomem and all associated definitions."
    
    So we'll just need to replace NO_IOPORT with NO_IOMEM in Kconfig and
    kill arch/s390/mm/ioremap.c.
    
    BTW, there's an annoying bit of junk in there - IO_SPACE_LIMIT.  We
    only need it for /proc/ioports, which AFAICS shouldn't even be there
    on s390 (or uml).  OTOH, removing that thing would mean a user-visible
    change - we go from "empty file in /proc" to "no such file in /proc"...

    * Split the implementation-agnostic stuff in separate files.
    * Make sure that targets using non-default request_irq() pull
      kernel/irq/devres.o
    * Introduce new symbols (HAS_IOPORT and HAS_IOMEM) defaulting to positive;
      allow architectures to turn them off (we needed these symbols anyway for
      dependencies of quite a few drivers).
    * protect the ioport-related parts of lib/devres.o with CONFIG_HAS_IOPORT.

    [PATCH] rapidio: fix multi-switch enumeration
    
    This patch contains two fixes for RapisIO enumeration logic:
    
    1. Fix enumeration in configurations with multiple switches. The patch adds:
    
       a. Enumeration of an empty switch.  Empty switch is a switch that
          does not have any endpoint devices attached to it (except host device
          or previous switch in a chain).  New code assigns a phony destination
          ID associated with the switch and sets up corresponding routes.
    
       b. Adds a second pass to the enumeration to setup routes to
          devices discovered after switch was scanned.
    
    2. Fix enumeration failure when riohdid parameter has non-zero value.
       Current version fails to setup response path to the host when it has
       destination ID other that 0.

    If you try to read things like /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease with single-byte

    [PATCH] order of lockdep off/on in vprintk() should be changed
    
    The order of locking between lockdep_off/on() and local_irq_save/restore() in
    vprintk() should be changed.
    
    * In kernel/printk.c :
    
    vprintk() does :
    
    preempt_disable()
    local_irq_save()
    lockdep_off()
    spin_lock(&logbuf_lock)
    spin_unlock(&logbuf_lock)
    if(!down_trylock(&console_sem))
       up(&console_sem)
    lockdep_on()
    local_irq_restore()
    preempt_enable()
    
    The goals here is to make sure we do not call printk() recursively from
    kernel/lockdep.c:__lock_acquire() (called from spin_* and down/up) nor from
    kernel/lockdep.c:trace_hardirqs_on/off() (called from local_irq_restore/save).
    It can then potentially call printk() through mark_held_locks/mark_lock.
    
    It correctly protects against the spin_lock call and the up/down call, but it
    does not protect against local_irq_restore. It could cause infinite recursive
    printk/trace_hardirqs_on() calls when printk() is called from the
    mark_lock() error handing path.
    
    We should change the locking so it becomes correct :
    
    preempt_disable()
    lockdep_off()
    local_irq_save()
    spin_lock(&logbuf_lock)
    spin_unlock(&logbuf_lock)
    if(!down_trylock(&console_sem))
       up(&console_sem)
    local_irq_restore()
    lockdep_on()
    preempt_enable()

    [PATCH] buffer: memorder fix
    
    unlock_buffer(), like unlock_page(), must not clear the lock without
    ensuring that the critical section is closed.
    
    Mingming later sent the same patch, saying:
    
      We are running SDET benchmark and saw double free issue for ext3 extended
      attributes block, which complains the same xattr block already being freed (in
      ext3_xattr_release_block()).  The problem could also been triggered by
      multiple threads loop untar/rm a kernel tree.
    
      The race is caused by missing a memory barrier at unlock_buffer() before the
      lock bit being cleared, resulting in possible concurrent h_refcounter update.
      That causes a reference counter leak, then later leads to the double free that
      we have seen.
    
      Inside unlock_buffer(), there is a memory barrier is placed *after* the lock
      bit is being cleared, however, there is no memory barrier *before* the bit is
      cleared.  On some arch the h_refcount update instruction and the clear bit
      instruction could be reordered, thus leave the critical section re-entered.
    
      The race is like this: For example, if the h_refcount is initialized as 1,
    
      cpu 0:                                   cpu1
      --------------------------------------   -----------------------------------
      lock_buffer() /* test_and_set_bit */
      clear_buffer_locked(bh);
                                              lock_buffer() /* test_and_set_bit */
      h_refcount = h_refcount+1; /* = 2*/     h_refcount = h_refcount + 1; /*= 2 */
                                              clear_buffer_locked(bh);
      ....                                    ......
    
      We lost a h_refcount here. We need a memory barrier before the buffer head lock
      bit being cleared to force the order of the two writes.  Please apply.

    [PATCH] extend the set of "__attribute__" shortcut macros
    
    Extend the set of "__attribute__" shortcut macros, and remove identical
    (and now superfluous) definitions from a couple of source files.
    
    based on a page at robert love's blog:
    
    	http://rlove.org/log/2005102601
    
    extend the set of shortcut macros defined in compiler-gcc.h with the
    following:
    
    #define __packed                       __attribute__((packed))
    #define __weak                         __attribute__((weak))
    #define __naked                        __attribute__((naked))
    #define __noreturn                     __attribute__((noreturn))
    #define __pure                         __attribute__((pure))
    #define __aligned(x)                   __attribute__((aligned(x)))
    #define __printf(a,b)                  __attribute__((format(printf,a,b)))
    
    Once these are in place, it's up to subsystem maintainers to decide if they
    want to take advantage of them.  there is already a strong precedent for
    using shortcuts like this in the source tree.
    
    The ones that might give people pause are "__aligned" and "__printf", but
    shortcuts for both of those are already in use, and in some ways very
    confusingly.  note the two very different definitions for a macro named
    "ALIGNED":
    
      drivers/net/sgiseeq.c:#define ALIGNED(x) ((((unsigned long)(x)) + 0xf) & ~(0xf))
      drivers/scsi/ultrastor.c:#define ALIGNED(x) __attribute__((aligned(x)))
    
    also:
    
      include/acpi/platform/acgcc.h:
        #define ACPI_PRINTF_LIKE(c) __attribute__ ((__format__ (__printf__, c, c+1)))
    
    Given the precedent, then, it seems logical to at least standardize on a
    consistent set of these macros.

    Return -ENOENT from ext[34]_link if we've raced with unlink and i_nlink is

    because we'd wind up with an inode with a non-zero link count on the list,
    and it will never get properly cleaned up & removed from the orphan list
    before it is freed.

    [PATCH] fix umask when noACL kernel meets extN tuned for ACLs
    
    Fix insecure default behaviour reported by Tigran Aivazian: if an ext2 or
    ext3 or ext4 filesystem is tuned to mount with "acl", but mounted by a
    kernel built without ACL support, then umask was ignored when creating
    inodes - though root or user has umask 022, touch creates files as 0666,
    and mkdir creates directories as 0777.
    
    This appears to have worked right until 2.6.11, when a fix to the default
    mode on symlinks (always 0777) assumed VFS applies umask: which it does,
    unless the mount is marked for ACLs; but ext[234] set MS_POSIXACL in
    s_flags according to s_mount_opt set according to def_mount_opts.
    
    We could revert to the 2.6.10 ext[234]_init_acl (adding an S_ISLNK test);
    but other filesystems only set MS_POSIXACL when ACLs are configured.  We
    could fix this at another level; but it seems most robust to avoid setting
    the s_mount_opt flag in the first place (at the expense of more ifdefs).
    
    Likewise don't set the XATTR_USER flag when built without XATTR support.

    [PATCH] raw: don't allow the creation of a raw device with minor number 0
    
    Minor number 0 (under the raw major) is reserved for the rawctl device
    file, which is used to query, set, and unset raw device bindings.  However,
    the ioctl interface does not protect the user from specifying a raw device
    with minor number 0:
    
    $ sudo ./raw /dev/raw/raw0 /dev/VolGroup00/swap
    /dev/raw/raw0:  bound to major 253, minor 2
    $ ls -l /dev/rawctl
    ls: /dev/rawctl: No such file or directory
    $ ls -l /dev/raw/raw0
    crw------- 1 root root 162, 0 Jan 12 10:51 /dev/raw/raw0
    $ sudo ./raw -qa
    Cannot open master raw device '/dev/rawctl' (No such file or directory)
    
    As you can see, this prevents any further raw operations from
    succeeding.  The fix (from Steve Fernandez) is quite simple--do not
    allow the allocation of minor number 0.

     kernel/auditfilter.c:1611: warning: 'state' is used uninitialized in this function
    
    I tend to agree with gcc - there are a couple of plausible exit paths from
    audit_filter_user_rules() where it does not set 'state', keeping the
    variable uninitialized.  For example if a filter rule has an AUDIT_POSSIBLE
    action.  Initialize to 'wont audit'.  Fix whitespace damage too.

    - in man and text mode output, if the function return type is empty (like it
      is for macros), don't print the return type and a following space; this
      fixes an output malalignment;
    
    - in the function short description, strip leading, trailing, and multiple

    [PATCH] RTC framework driver for CMOS RTCs
    
    This is an "RTC framework" driver for the "CMOS" RTCs which are standard on
    PCs and some other platforms.  That's MC146818 compatible silicon.
    Advantages of this vs.  drivers/char/rtc.c (use one _or_ the other, only
    one will be able to claim the RTC irq) include:
    
     - This leverages both the new RTC framework and the driver model; both
       PNPACPI and platform device modes are supported.  (A separate patch
       creates a platform device on PCs where PNPACPI isn't configured.)
    
     - It supports common extensions like longer alarms.  (A separate patch
       exports that information from ACPI through platform_data.)
    
     - Likewise, system wakeup events use "real driver model support", with
       policy control via sysfs "wakeup" attributes and and using normal rtc
       ioctls to manage wakeup.  (Patch in the works.  The ACPI hooks are
       known; /proc/acpi/alarm can vanish.  Making it work with EFI will
       be a minor challenge to someone with e.g. a MiniMac.)
    
    It's not yet been tested on non-x86 systems, without ACPI, or with HPET.
    And the RTC framework will surely have teething pains on "mainstream"
    PC-based systems (though must embedded Linux systems use it heavily), not
    limited to sorting out the "/dev/rtc0" issue (udev easily tweaked).  Also,
    the ALSA rtctimer code doesn't use the new RTC API.
    
    Otherwise, this should be a no-known-regressions replacement for the old
    drivers/char/rtc.c driver, and should help the non-embedded distros (and
    the new timekeeping code) start to switch to the framework.
    
    Note also that any systems using "rtc-m48t86" are candidates to switch over
    to this more functional driver; the platform data is different, and the way
    bytes are read is different, but otherwise those chips should be compatible.

    [PATCH] Common compat_sys_sysinfo
    
    I noticed that almost all architectures implemented exactly the same
    sys32_sysinfo...  except parisc, where a bug was to be found in handling of
    the uptime.  So let's remove a whole whack of code for fun and profit.
    Cribbed compat_sys_sysinfo from x86_64's implementation, since I figured it
    would be the best tested.
    
    This patch incorporates Arnd's suggestion of not using set_fs/get_fs, but
    instead extracting out the common code from sys_sysinfo.

    [PATCH] tty: improve encode_baud_rate logic
    
    Mostly so people can see the work in progress.  This enhances the encode
    function which isn't currently used in the base tree but is when using some of
    the testing tty patches.
    
    This resolves a problem with some hardware where applications got confusing
    information from the tty ioctls.  Correct but confusing.
    
    In some situations asking for, say, 9600 baud actually gets you 9595 baud or
    similar near-miss values.  With the old code this meant that a request for
    B9600 got a return of BOTHER, 9595 which programs interpreted as a failure.
    
    The new code now works on the following basis
    
    - If you ask for specific rate via BOTHER, you get a precise return
    
    - If you ask for a standard Bfoo rate and the result is close you get a Bfoo
      return
    
    - If you ask for a standard Bfoo rate and get something way off you get a
      BOTHER/rate return
    
    This seems to fix up the cases I've found where this broke compatibility.

    [PATCH] relax check for AIX in msdos partition table
    
    The patch to identify AIX disks and ignore them has caused at least one
    machine to fail to find the root partition on 2.6.19. The patch is:
    
    http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/31/117
    
    The problem is some disk formatters do not blow away the first 4 bytes
    of the disk. If the disk we are installing to used to have AIX on it,
    then the first 4 bytes will still have IBMA in EBCDIC.
    
    The install in question was debian etch. Im not sure what the best fix
    is, perhaps the AIX detection code could check more than the first 4
    bytes.
    
    The whole partition info for primary partitions is in this block:
    
      dd if=/dev/sdb count=$(( 4 * 16 )) bs=1 skip=$(( 0x1be ))
    
    All other data do not matter, beside the 0x55aa marker at the end of the
    first block.

    [PATCH] IPMI: Fix some RCU problems
    
    Fix some RCU problem pointed out by Paul McKenney of IBM.  These are:
    
    The wholesale move of the command receivers list into a new list was not
    safe because the list will point to the new tail during a traversal, so the
    traversal will never end on a reader if this happens during a read.
    
    Memory barriers were needed to handle proper ordering of the setting of the
    IPMI interface as valid.  Readers might not see proper ordering of data
    otherwise.
    
    In ipmi_smi_watcher_register(), the use of the _rcu suffix on the list is
    unnecessary.
    
    This require the list_splice_init_rcu() patch previously posted.

    [PATCH] add an RCU version of list splicing
    
    This patch is in support of the IPMI driver.  I have tested this with the
    IPMI driver changes coming in the next patch.
    
    Add a list_splice_init_rcu() function to splice an RCU-protected list into
    another list.  This takes the sync function as an argument, so one would do
    something like:
    
    	INIT_LIST_HEAD(&list);
    	list_splice_init_rcu(&source, &dest, synchronize_rcu);
    
    The idea being to keep the RCU API proliferation down to a dull roar.

    [PATCH] use cycle_t instead of u64 in struct time_interpolator
    
    The 32bit and 64bit PARISC Linux kernels suffers from the problem, that the
    gettimeofday() call sometimes returns non-monotonic times.
    
    The easiest way to fix this, is to drop the PARISC-specific implementation
    and switch over to the generic TIME_INTERPOLATION framework.
    
    But in order to make it even compile on 32bit PARISC, the patch below which
    touches the generic Linux code, is mandatory.
    
    More information and the full patch with the parisc-specific changes is included in this thread: http://lists.parisc-linux.org/pipermail/parisc-linux/2006-December/031003.html
    
    As far as I could see, this patch does not change anything for the existing
    architectures which use this framework (IA64 and SPARC64), since "cycles_t"
    is defined there as unsigned 64bit-integer anyway (which then makes this
    patch a no-change for them).

    [PATCH] remove invalidate_inode_pages()
    
    Convert all calls to invalidate_inode_pages() into open-coded calls to
    invalidate_mapping_pages().
    
    Leave the invalidate_inode_pages() wrapper in place for now, marked as
    deprecated.

    [PATCH] Export invalidate_mapping_pages() to modules
    
    It makes no sense to me to export invalidate_inode_pages() and not
    invalidate_mapping_pages() and I actually need invalidate_mapping_pages()
    because of its range specification ability...
    
    akpm: also remove the export of invalidate_inode_pages() by making it an
    inlined wrapper.

    [PATCH] DocBook/HTML: correction of recursive A tags in HTML output
    
    The malformed HTML was generated after switch to XSLTPROC
    from SGML tools. The reference title
    
      <refentrytitle><phrase id="API-struct-x">struct x</phrase></refentrytitle>

      <a href="re02.html"><span><a id="API-struct-x"></a>struct x</span></a>
    
    There is more possible solutions for this problem.
    One can be found at
    
      http://darkk.livejournal.com/
    
    The proposed solution is based on suggestion provided by Jiri Kosek.

    [PATCH] Add TAINT_USER and ability to set taint flags from userspace
    
    Allow taint flags to be set from userspace by writing to
    /proc/sys/kernel/tainted, and add a new taint flag, TAINT_USER, to be used
    when userspace has potentially done something dangerous that might
    compromise the kernel.  This will allow support personnel to ask further
    questions about what may have caused the user taint flag to have been set.
    
    For example, they might examine the logs of the realtime JVM to see if the
    Java program has used the really silly, stupid, dangerous, and
    completely-non-portable direct access to physical memory feature which MUST
    be implemented according to the Real-Time Specification for Java (RTSJ).
    Sigh.  What were those silly people at Sun thinking?

    It's safe to call tty_wakeup from irq context. Do not schedule it for later

    [PATCH] PNP: export pnp_bus_type
    
    The PNP framework doesn't export "pnp_bus_type", which is an unfortunate
    exception to the policy followed by pretty much every other bus.  I noticed
    this when I had to find a device in order to provide its platform_data.
    
    Note that per advice from Arjan, the "export" scope has been been minimized to
    avoid the hundred-plus bytes needed to support access from modules.  In this
    case, the symbol is only needed by statically linked kernel code that lives
    outside the drivers/pnp directory.

    [PATCH] ext2: skip pages past number of blocks in ext2_find_entry
    
    This one was pointed out on the MOKB site:
    http://kernelfun.blogspot.com/2006/11/mokb-09-11-2006-linux-26x-ext2checkpage.html
    
    If a directory's i_size is corrupted, ext2_find_entry() will keep
    processing pages until the i_size is reached, even if there are no more
    blocks associated with the directory inode.  This patch puts in some
    minimal sanity-checking so that we don't keep checking pages (and issuing
    errors) if we know there can be no more data to read, based on the block
    count of the directory inode.
    
    This is somewhat similar in approach to the ext3 patch I sent earlier this
    year.

    [PATCH] Relay: add CPU hotplug support
    
    Mathieu originally needed to add this for tracing Xen, but it's something
    that's needed for any application that can be tracing while cpus are added.
    
    unplug isn't supported by this patch.  The thought was that at minumum a new
    buffer needs to be added when a cpu comes up, but it wasn't worth the effort
    to remove buffers on cpu down since they'd be freed soon anyway when the
    channel was closed.

    Userspace should be worrying about userspace, so having the socket.h

    pretty much prevents any other libc from utilizing these headers
    sanely unless they set up the __GLIBC__ define themselves (which

    [PATCH] consolidate line discipline number definitions
    
    The line discipline numbers N_* are currently defined for each architecture
    individually, but (except for a seeming mistake) identically, in
    asm/termios.h.  There is no obvious reason why these numbers should be
    architecture specific, nor any apparent relationship with the termios
    structure.  The total number of these, NR_LDISCS, is defined in linux/tty.h
    anyway.  So I propose the following patch which moves the definitions of
    the individual line disciplines to linux/tty.h too.
    
    Three of these numbers (N_MASC, N_PROFIBUS_FDL, and N_SMSBLOCK) are unused
    in the current kernel, but the patch still keeps the complete set in case
    there are plans to use them yet.

    [PATCH] igrab() should check for I_CLEAR
    
    When igrab() is calling __iget() on an inode it should check if
    clear_inode() has been called on the inode already.  Otherwise there is a
    race window between clear_inode() and destroy_inode() where igrab() calls
    __iget() which leads to already free inodes on the inode lists.

    [PATCH] lockdep: more unlock-on-error fixes
    
    - returns after DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON added in 3 places
    
    - debug_locks checking after lookup_chain_cache() added in
      __lock_acquire()
    
    - locking for testing and changing global variable max_lockdep_depth
      added in __lock_acquire()
    
    From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
    
    My __acquire_lock() cleanup introduced a locking bug: on SMP systems we'd
    release a non-owned graph lock.  Fix this by moving the graph unlock back,
    and by leaving the max_lockdep_depth variable update possibly racy.  (we
    dont care, it's just statistics)
    
    Also add some minimal debugging code to graph_unlock()/graph_lock(),
    which caught this locking bug.

    [PATCH] avoid one conditional branch in touch_atime()
    
    I added IS_NOATIME(inode) macro definition in include/linux/fs.h, true if
    the inode superblock is marked readonly or noatime.
    
    This new macro is then used in touch_atime() instead of separatly testing
    MS_RDONLY and MS_NOATIME

    [PATCH] struct vfsmount: keep mnt_count & mnt_expiry_mark away from mnt_flags
    
    I noticed cache misses in touch_atime() that can be avoided if we keep
    mnt_count & mnt_expiry_mark in a different cache line than mnt_flags
    (mostly read)
    
    mnt_count & mnt_expiry_mark are modified each time a file is opened/closed
    in a file system.
    
    touch_atime() is called each time a file is read, and generally needs to
    read mnt_flags.
    
    Other fields of struct vfsmount are mostly read so I chose to move
    mnt_count & mnt_expiry_mark at the end of struct vfsmount.  And adding a
    comment so that nobody tries to re-arrange fields to fill the holes :)
    
    On 64bits platforms, the new offsetof(mnt_count) is 0xC0
    On 32bits platforms, it is 0x60, so I didnot add a
    ____cacheline_aligned_in_smp because it would have a too big impact on the
    size of this object (in particular if CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT=7)

    [PATCH] usr/gen_init_cpio.c: support for hard links
    
    Extend usr/gen_init_cpio.c "file" entry, adding support for hard links.
    
    Previous format:
    file <name> <location> <mode> <uid> <gid>
    
    New format:
    file <name> <location> <mode> <uid> <gid> [<hard links>]
    
    The hard links specification is optional, keeping the previous
    behaviour.
    
    All hard links are defined sequentially in the resulting cpio and the
    file data is present only in the last link. This is the behaviour of
    GNU's cpio and is supported by the kernel initramfs extractor.

    [PATCH] disable init/initramfs.c
    
    The file init/initramfs.c is always compiled and linked in the kernel
    vmlinux even when BLK_DEV_RAM and BLK_DEV_INITRD are disabled and the
    system isn't using any form of an initramfs or initrd.  In this situation
    the code is only used to unpack a (static) default initial rootfilesystem.
    The current init/initramfs.c code.  usr/initramfs_data.o compiles to a size
    of ~15 kbytes.  Disabling BLK_DEV_RAM and BLK_DEV_INTRD shrinks the kernel
    code size with ~60 Kbytes.
    
    This patch avoids compiling in the code and data for initramfs support if
    CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD is not defined.  Instead of the initramfs code and
    data it uses a small routine in init/noinitramfs.c to setup an initial
    static default environment for mounting a rootfilesystem later on in the
    kernel initialisation process.  The new code is: 164 bytes of size.
    
    The patch is separated in two parts:
    1) doesn't compile initramfs code when CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD is not set
    2) changing all plaforms vmlinux.lds.S files to not reserve an area of
    PAGE_SIZE when CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD is not set.

    2) if *oldlenp >= table->maxlen,
    	don't writeback more than table->maxlen bytes and rewrite *oldlenp

    3) if 0 < *oldlenp < table->maxlen,
    		*cough*
    	string sysctls don't writeback more than *oldlenp bytes.
    	OK, that's because sizeof(char) == 1
    
    	int sysctls writeback anything in (0, table->maxlen] range
    	Though accept integers divisible by sizeof(int) for writing.
    
    sysctl_jiffies and sysctl_ms_jiffies don't writeback anything but
    sizeof(int), which violates 1) and 2).
    
    So, make sysctl_jiffies and sysctl_ms_jiffies accept
    a) *oldlenp == 0, not doing writeback
    b) *oldlenp >= sizeof(int), writing one integer.
    
    -EINVAL still returned for *oldlenp == 1, 2, 3.

    [PATCH] vt: refactor console SAK processing
    
    This does several things.
    - It moves looking up of the current foreground console into process
      context where we can safely take the semaphore that protects this
      operation.
    - It uses the new flavor of work queue processing.
    - This generates a factor of do_SAK, __do_SAK that runs immediately.
    - This calls __do_SAK with the console semaphore held ensuring nothing
      else happens to the console while we process the SAK operation.
    - With the console SAK processing moved into process context this
      patch removes the xchg operations that I used to attempt to attomically
      update struct pid, because of the strange locking used in the SAK processing.
      With SAK using the normal console semaphore nothing special is needed.

    [PATCH] Add retain_initrd boot option
    
    Add retain_initrd option to control freeing of initrd memory after
    extraction.  By default, free memory as previously.
    
    The first boot will need to hold a copy of the in memory fs for the second
    boot.  This image can be large (much larger than the kernel), hence we can
    save time when the memory loader is slow.  Also, it reduces the memory
    footprint while extracting the first boot since you don't need another copy
    of the fs.

    [PATCH] uml: x86_64 ptrace fixes
    
    This patch fixes some missing ptrace bits on x86_64.  PTRACE_ARCH_PRCTL is
    hooked up and implemented.  This required generalizing arch_prctl_skas
    slightly to take a task_struct to modify.  Previously, it always operated on
    current.
    
    Reading and writing the debug registers is also enabled by un-ifdefing the
    code that implements that.  It turns out that x86_64 is identical to i386, so
    the same code can be used.

    [PATCH] uml: x86_64 thread fixes
    
    x86_64 needs some TLS fixes.  What was missing was remembering the child
    thread id during clone and stuffing it into the child during each context
    switch.
    
    The %fs value is stored separately in the thread structure since the host
    controls what effect it has on the actual register file.  The host also needs
    to store it in its own thread struct, so we need the value kept outside the
    register file.
    
    arch_prctl_skas was fixed to call PTRACE_ARCH_PRCTL appropriately.  There is
    some saving and restoring of registers in the ARCH_SET_* cases so that the
    correct set of registers are changed on the host and restored to the process
    when it runs again.

    [PATCH] uml: fix error output during early boot
    
    The startup code panics a lot if anything goes wrong early on.  This is wrong
    for several reasons, like the kernel isn't running, so you can't really be
    calling into it yet, but the harm comes from useful error messages being
    trapped in the printk ring where no one will ever see them.
    
    This patch changes these panics to perror and printf in wrappers which also
    exit.  Normal, informational, prints are also wrapped so that fflush(stdout)
    is called after each one.  This is so the output appears in the correct
    sequence in the event of an error.

    [PATCH] uml: libc-dependent code should call libc directly
    
    We shouldn't be using the os wrappers from os code - we can use libc directly.
    This patch replaces wrapper calls with libc calls.
    
    It turns out that os_sigio_async had only one caller, which was in startup.c,
    so that function is moved there and its name changed.

    [PATCH] uml: add per-device queues and locks to ubd driver
    
    Replace global queue and lock with per-device queues and locks.  Mostly a
    straightforward replacement of ubd_io_lock with dev->lock and ubd_queue with
    dev->queue.
    
    Complications -
    	There was no way to get a request struct (and queue) from the
    structure sent to the io_thread, so a pointer to the request was
    added.  This is needed in ubd_handler in order to kick do_ubd_request
    to process another request.
    	Queue initialization is moved from ubd_init to ubd_add.

    [PATCH] uml: console locking commentary and code cleanup
    
    Remove the last vestiges of devfs from console registration.  Change the name
    of the function, plus remove a couple of unused fields from the line_driver
    structure.
    
    struct lines is no longer needed, all traces of it are gone.
    
    The only way that I can see to mark a structure as being almost-const is to
    individually const the fields.  This is the case for the line_driver
    structure, which has only one modifiable field - a list_head in a
    sub-structure.

    The locking of the mconsole console output code was confused.  Now, the
    console_lock (renamed to client_lock) protects the clients list.

    [PATCH] uml: add locking to network transport registration
    
    The registration of host network transports needed some locking.  The
    transport list itself is locked, but calls to the registration routines are
    not.  This is compensated for by checking that a transport structure is not
    yet on any list.
    
    I also took the opportunity to const all fields in the transport structure
    except the list, which obviously can be modified.

    [PATCH] uml: return hotplug errors to host
    
    I noticed that errors happening while hotplugging devices from the host were
    never returned back to the mconsole client.  In some cases, success was
    returned instead of even an information-free error.
    
    This patch cleans that up by having the low-level configuration code pass back
    an error string along with an error code.  At the top level, which knows
    whether it is early boot time or responding to an mconsole request, the string
    is printk'd or returned to the mconsole client.
    
    There are also whitespace and trivial code cleanups in the surrounding code.

    [PATCH] uml: console locking fixes
    
    Clean up the console driver locking.  There are various problems here,
    including sleeping under a spinlock and spinlock recursion, some of which are
    fixed here.  This patch deals with the locking involved with opens and closes.
     The problem is that an mconsole request to change a console's configuration
    can race with an open.  Changing a configuration should only be done when a
    console isn't opened.  Also, an open must be looking at a stable
    configuration.  In addition, a get configuration request must observe the same
    locking since it must also see a stable configuration.  With the old locking,
    it was possible for this to hang indefinitely in some cases because open would
    block for a long time waiting for a connection from the host while holding the
    lock needed by the mconsole request.
    
    As explained in the long comment, this is fixed by adding a spinlock for the
    use count and configuration and a mutex for the actual open and close.

    [PATCH] kernel/time/clocksource.c needs struct task_struct on m68k
    
    kernel/time/clocksource.c needs struct task_struct on m68k.
    
    Because it uses spin_unlock_irq(), which, on m68k, uses hardirq_count(), which
    uses preempt_count(), which needs to dereference struct task_struct, we
    have to include sched.h. Because it would cause a loop inclusion, we
    cannot include sched.h in any other of asm-m68k/system.h,
    linux/thread_info.h, linux/hardirq.h, which leaves this ugly include in
    a C file as the only simple solution.

    [PATCH] m68k: work around binutils tokenizer change
    
    Recent as(1) doesn't think that .  terminates a macro name, so getuser.l is
    _not_ treated as invoking getuser with .l as the first argument.
    arch/m68k/math-emu relies on old behaviour, so it gets a lot of undefined
    macros with more or less current binutils.
    
    Note that this behaviour remains in all recent versions and is unrelated to
    another binutils problems we used to have for a while (having (%a0)+ parsed
    as two arguments).  This one is there to stay; it's an intentional and
    documented change.
    
    .irp <identifier> <words>
    [text]
    .endr
    expands to a copy of text per each word, with \<identifier> replaced with
    corresponding word.  Again, what happens depends on whether gas_ident.x
    is treated as one or as two tokens; in the former case we'll get old_gas
    incremented once, in the latter - twice.  The rest is obvious.
    
    Unlike .macro argument list _anything_ is explicitly allowed after
    .irp <identifier>; here we are on very safe ground.  And yes, it does
    work with all gas variants I've got here (including vanilla 2.15, 2.16,
    2.16.1 and 2.17, plus debian and FC binutils).

    [PATCH] swsusp: Change pm_ops handling by userland interface
    
    Make the userland interface of swsusp call pm_ops->finish() after
    enable_nonboot_cpus() and before resume_device(), as indicated by the recent
    discussion on Linux-PM (cf.
    http://lists.osdl.org/pipermail/linux-pm/2006-November/004164.html).
    
    This patch changes the SNAPSHOT_PMOPS ioctl so that its first function,
    PMOPS_PREPARE, only sets a switch turning the platform suspend mode on, and
    its last function, PMOPS_FINISH, only checks if the platform mode is enabled.
    This should allow the older userland tools to work with new kernels without
    any modifications.
    
    The changes here only affect the userland interface of swsusp.

    [PATCH] swsusp: Change code ordering in user.c
    
    Change the ordering of code in kernel/power/user.c so that device_suspend() is
    called before disable_nonboot_cpus() and device_resume() is called after
    enable_nonboot_cpus().  This is needed to make the userland suspend call
    pm_ops->finish() after enable_nonboot_cpus() and before device_resume(), as
    indicated by the recent discussion on Linux-PM (cf.
    http://lists.osdl.org/pipermail/linux-pm/2006-November/004164.html).
    
    The changes here only affect the userland interface of swsusp.

    [PATCH] PM: Change code ordering in main.c
    
    As indicated in a recent thread on Linux-PM, it's necessary to call
    pm_ops->finish() before devce_resume(), but enable_nonboot_cpus() has to be
    called before pm_ops->finish() (cf.
    http://lists.osdl.org/pipermail/linux-pm/2006-November/004164.html).  For
    consistency, it seems reasonable to call disable_nonboot_cpus() after
    device_suspend().
    
    This way the suspend code will remain symmetrical with respect to the resume
    code and it may allow us to speed up things in the future by suspending and
    resuming devices and/or saving the suspend image in many threads.
    
    The following series of patches reorders the suspend and resume code so that
    nonboot CPUs are disabled after devices have been suspended and enabled before
    the devices are resumed.  It also causes pm_ops->finish() to be called after
    enable_nonboot_cpus() wherever necessary.
    
    This patch:
    
    Change the ordering of code in kernel/power/main.c so that device_suspend()
    is called before disable_nonboot_cpus() and pm_ops->finish() is called after
    enable_nonboot_cpus() and before device_resume(), as indicated by recent
    discussion on Linux-PM
    (cf. http://lists.osdl.org/pipermail/linux-pm/2006-November/004164.html).

    [PATCH] make reading /proc/sys/kernel/cap-bould not require CAP_SYS_MODULE
    
    Reading /proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound requires CAP_SYS_MODULE.  (see
    proc_dointvec_bset in kernel/sysctl.c)
    
    sysctl appears to drive all over proc reading everything it can get it's
    hands on and is complaining when it is being denied access to read
    cap-bound.  Clearly writing to cap-bound should be a sensitive operation
    but requiring CAP_SYS_MODULE to read cap-bound seems a bit to strong.  I
    believe the information could with reasonable certainty be obtained by
    looking at a bunch of the output of /proc/pid/status which has very low
    security protection, so at best we are just getting a little obfuscation of
    information.
    
    Currently SELinux policy has to 'dontaudit' capability checks for
    CAP_SYS_MODULE for things like sysctl which just want to read cap-bound.
    In doing so we also as a byproduct have to hide warnings of potential
    exploits such as if at some time that sysctl actually tried to load a
    module.  I wondered if anyone would have a problem opening cap-bound up to
    read from anyone?

    [PATCH] do not disturb page referenced state when unmapping memory range
    
    When kernel unmaps an address range, it needs to transfer PTE state into
    page struct.  Currently, kernel transfer access bit via
    mark_page_accessed().  The call to mark_page_accessed in the unmap path
    doesn't look logically correct.
    
    At unmap time, calling mark_page_accessed will causes page LRU state to be
    bumped up one step closer to more recently used state.  It is causing quite
    a bit headache in a scenario when a process creates a shmem segment, touch
    a whole bunch of pages, then unmaps it.  The unmapping takes a long time
    because mark_page_accessed() will start moving pages from inactive to
    active list.
    
    I'm not too much concerned with moving the page from one list to another in
    LRU.  Sooner or later it might be moved because of multiple mappings from
    various processes.  But it just doesn't look logical that when user asks a
    range to be unmapped, it's his intention that the process is no longer
    interested in these pages.  Moving those pages to active list (or bumping
    up a state towards more active) seems to be an over reaction.  It also
    prolongs unmapping latency which is the core issue I'm trying to solve.
    
    As suggested by Peter, we should still preserve the info on pte young
    pages, but not more.

    [PATCH] simplify shmem_aops.set_page_dirty() method
    
    shmem backed file does not have page writeback, nor it participates in
    backing device's dirty or writeback accounting.  So using generic
    __set_page_dirty_nobuffers() for its .set_page_dirty aops method is a bit
    overkill.  It unnecessarily prolongs shm unmap latency.
    
    For example, on a densely populated large shm segment (sevearl GBs), the
    unmapping operation becomes painfully long.  Because at unmap, kernel
    transfers dirty bit in PTE into page struct and to the radix tree tag.  The
    operation of tagging the radix tree is particularly expensive because it
    has to traverse the tree from the root to the leaf node on every dirty
    page.  What's bothering is that radix tree tag is used for page write back.
     However, shmem is memory backed and there is no page write back for such
    file system.  And in the end, we spend all that time tagging radix tree and
    none of that fancy tagging will be used.  So let's simplify it by introduce
    a new aops __set_page_dirty_no_writeback and this will speed up shm unmap.

    [PATCH] zoneid: fix up calculations for ZONEID_PGSHIFT
    
    Currently if we have a non-zero ZONES_SHIFT we assume we are able to rely
    on that as the bottom edge of the ZONEID, if not then we use the
    NODES_PGOFF as the right end of either NODES _or_ SECTION.  This latter is
    more luck than judgement and would be incorrect if we reordered the
    SECTION,NODE,ZONE options in the fields space.
    
    Really what we want is the lower of the right hand end of the two fields we
    are using (either NODE,ZONE or SECTION,ZONE).  Codify that explicitly.  As
    always allow for there being no bits in either of the fields, such as might
    be valid in a non-numa machine with only a zone NORMAL.
    
    I have checked that the compiler is still able to constant fold all of this
    away correctly.

    [PATCH] Set CONFIG_ZONE_DMA for arches with GENERIC_ISA_DMA
    
    As Andi pointed out: CONFIG_GENERIC_ISA_DMA only disables the ISA DMA
    channel management.  Other functionality may still expect GFP_DMA to
    provide memory below 16M.  So we need to make sure that CONFIG_ZONE_DMA is
    set independent of CONFIG_GENERIC_ISA_DMA.  Undo the modifications to
    mm/Kconfig where we made ZONE_DMA dependent on GENERIC_ISA_DMA and set
    theses explicitly in each arches Kconfig.
    
    Reviews must occur for each arch in order to determine if ZONE_DMA can be
    switched off.  It can only be switched off if we know that all devices
    supported by a platform are capable of performing DMA transfers to all of
    memory (Some arches already support this: uml, avr32, sh sh64, parisc and
    IA64/Altix).
    
    In order to switch ZONE_DMA off conditionally, one would have to establish
    a scheme by which one can assure that no drivers are enabled that are only
    capable of doing I/O to a part of memory, or one needs to provide an
    alternate means of performing an allocation from a specific range of memory
    (like provided by alloc_pages_range()) and insure that all drivers use that
    call.  In that case the arches alloc_dma_coherent() may need to be modified
    to call alloc_pages_range() instead of relying on GFP_DMA.

    [PATCH] optional ZONE_DMA: introduce CONFIG_ZONE_DMA
    
    This patch simply defines CONFIG_ZONE_DMA for all arches.  We later do special
    things with CONFIG_ZONE_DMA after the VM and an arch are prepared to work
    without ZONE_DMA.
    
    CONFIG_ZONE_DMA can be defined in two ways depending on how an architecture
    handles ISA DMA.
    
    First if CONFIG_GENERIC_ISA_DMA is set by the arch then we know that the arch
    needs ZONE_DMA because ISA DMA devices are supported.  We can catch this in
    mm/Kconfig and do not need to modify arch code.
    
    Second, arches may use ZONE_DMA in an unknown way.  We set CONFIG_ZONE_DMA for
    all arches that do not set CONFIG_GENERIC_ISA_DMA in order to insure backwards
    compatibility.  The arches may later undefine ZONE_DMA if their arch code has
    been verified to not depend on ZONE_DMA.

    [PATCH] optional ZONE_DMA: deal with cases of ZONE_DMA meaning the first zone
    
    This patchset follows up on the earlier work in Andrew's tree to reduce the
    number of zones.  The patches allow to go to a minimum of 2 zones.  This one
    allows also to make ZONE_DMA optional and therefore the number of zones can be
    reduced to one.
    
    ZONE_DMA is usually used for ISA DMA devices.  There are a number of reasons
    why we would not want to have ZONE_DMA
    
    1. Some arches do not need ZONE_DMA at all.
    
    2. With the advent of IOMMUs DMA zones are no longer needed.
       The necessity of DMA zones may drastically be reduced
       in the future. This patchset allows a compilation of
       a kernel without that overhead.
    
    3. Devices that require ISA DMA get rare these days. All
       my systems do not have any need for ISA DMA.
    
    4. The presence of an additional zone unecessarily complicates
       VM operations because it must be scanned and balancing
       logic must operate on its.
    
    5. With only ZONE_NORMAL one can reach the situation where
       we have only one zone. This will allow the unrolling of many
       loops in the VM and allows the optimization of varous
       code paths in the VM.
    
    6. Having only a single zone in a NUMA system results in a
       1-1 correspondence between nodes and zones. Various additional
       optimizations to critical VM paths become possible.
    
    Many systems today can operate just fine with a single zone.  If you look at
    what is in ZONE_DMA then one usually sees that nothing uses it.  The DMA slabs
    are empty (Some arches use ZONE_DMA instead of ZONE_NORMAL, then ZONE_NORMAL
    will be empty instead).
    
    On all of my systems (i386, x86_64, ia64) ZONE_DMA is completely empty.  Why
    constantly look at an empty zone in /proc/zoneinfo and empty slab in
    /proc/slabinfo?  Non i386 also frequently have no need for ZONE_DMA and zones
    stay empty.
    
    The patchset was tested on i386 (UP / SMP), x86_64 (UP, NUMA) and ia64 (NUMA).
    
    The RFC posted earlier (see
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=115231723513008&w=2) had lots
    of #ifdefs in them.  An effort has been made to minize the number of #ifdefs
    and make this as compact as possible.  The job was made much easier by the
    ongoing efforts of others to extract common arch specific functionality.
    
    I have been running this for awhile now on my desktop and finally Linux is
    using all my available RAM instead of leaving the 16MB in ZONE_DMA untouched:
    
    christoph@pentium940:~$ cat /proc/zoneinfo

    This patch:
    
    In two places in the VM we use ZONE_DMA to refer to the first zone.  If
    ZONE_DMA is optional then other zones may be first.  So simply replace
    ZONE_DMA with zone 0.
    
    This also fixes ZONETABLE_PGSHIFT.  If we have only a single zone then
    ZONES_PGSHIFT may become 0 because there is no need anymore to encode the zone
    number related to a pgdat.  However, we still need a zonetable to index all
    the zones for each node if this is a NUMA system.  Therefore define
    ZONETABLE_SHIFT unconditionally as the offset of the ZONE field in page flags.

    [PATCH] Reorder ZVCs according to cacheline
    
    The global and per zone counter sums are in arrays of longs.  Reorder the ZVCs
    so that the most frequently used ZVCs are put into the same cacheline.  That
    way calculations of the global, node and per zone vm state touches only a
    single cacheline.  This is mostly important for 64 bit systems were one 128
    byte cacheline takes only 8 longs.

    [PATCH] Use ZVC for inactive and active counts
    
    The determination of the dirty ratio to determine writeback behavior is
    currently based on the number of total pages on the system.
    
    However, not all pages in the system may be dirtied.  Thus the ratio is always
    too low and can never reach 100%.  The ratio may be particularly skewed if
    large hugepage allocations, slab allocations or device driver buffers make
    large sections of memory not available anymore.  In that case we may get into
    a situation in which f.e.  the background writeback ratio of 40% cannot be
    reached anymore which leads to undesired writeback behavior.
    
    This patchset fixes that issue by determining the ratio based on the actual
    pages that may potentially be dirty.  These are the pages on the active and
    the inactive list plus free pages.
    
    The problem with those counts has so far been that it is expensive to
    calculate these because counts from multiple nodes and multiple zones will
    have to be summed up.  This patchset makes these counters ZVC counters.  This
    means that a current sum per zone, per node and for the whole system is always
    available via global variables and not expensive anymore to calculate.
    
    The patchset results in some other good side effects:
    
    - Removal of the various functions that sum up free, active and inactive
      page counts
    
    - Cleanup of the functions that display information via the proc filesystem.
    
    This patch:
    
    The use of a ZVC for nr_inactive and nr_active allows a simplification of some
    counter operations.  More ZVC functionality is used for sums etc in the
    following patches.

    find_min_pfn_for_node() and find_min_pfn_with_active_regions() sort
    early_node_map[] on every call.  This is an excessive amount of sorting and
    that can be avoided.  This patch always searches the whole early_node_map[]
    in find_min_pfn_for_node() instead of returning the first value found.  The
    map is then only sorted once when required.  Successfully boot tested on a

    [ARM] 4158/1: Fix user page protection macros
    
    The PAGE_* user page protection macros don't take into account the
    configured memory policy and other architecture specific bits like
    the global/ASID and shared mapping bits. Instead of constants let
    these depend on a variable fixed up at init just like PAGE_KERNEL.

    [ARM] i.MX serial: fix IRQ allocation
    
    If RTS interrupt is caused by RTS senzing logic inside i.MX UART module the
    IRQ type cannot be set.
    
    It applies only for interrupts going through GPIO layer.  The problem has
    been noticed by Konstantin Kletschke some time ago.
    
      No IRQF_TRIGGER set_type function for IRQ 26 (MPU)
    
    I would not change type to fixed 0, because it could be possible to use
    different GPIO MX1 pin for RTS in the theory.  On the other hand it is only
    for documentation purposes now, because RTS read code would have to be
    adjusted in such case.

    [SPARC64]: Add PCI MSI support on Niagara.
    
    This is kind of hokey, we could use the hardware provided facilities
    much better.
    
    MSIs are assosciated with MSI Queues.  MSI Queues generate interrupts
    when any MSI assosciated with it is signalled.  This suggests a
    two-tiered IRQ dispatch scheme:
    
    	MSI Queue interrupt --> queue interrupt handler
    		MSI dispatch --> driver interrupt handler
    
    But we just get one-level under Linux currently.  What I'd like to do
    is possibly stick the IRQ actions into a per-MSI-Queue data structure,
    and dispatch them form there, but the generic IRQ layer doesn't
    provide a way to do that right now.
    
    So, the current kludge is to "ACK" the interrupt by processing the
    MSI Queue data structures and ACK'ing them, then we run the actual
    handler like normal.
    
    We are wasting a lot of useful information, for example the MSI data
    and address are provided with ever MSI, as well as a system tick if
    available.  If we could pass this into the IRQ handler it could help
    with certain things, in particular for PCI-Express error messages.
    
    The MSI entries on sparc64 also tell you exactly which bus/device/fn
    sent the MSI, which would be great for error handling when no
    registered IRQ handler can service the interrupt.
    
    We override the disable/enable IRQ chip methods in sun4v_msi, so we
    have to call {mask,unmask}_msi_irq() directly from there.  This is
    another ugly wart.

    [PARTITION]: Add whole_disk attribute.
    
    Some partitioning systems create special partitions that
    span the entire disk.  One example are Sun partitions, and
    this whole-disk partition exists to tell the firmware the
    extent of the entire device so it can load the boot block
    and do other things.
    
    Such partitions should not be treated as normal partitions,
    because all the other partitions overlap this whole-disk one.
    So we'd see multiple instances of the same UUID etc. which
    we do not want.  udev and friends can thus search for this
    'whole_disk' attribute and use it to decide to ignore the
    partition.

    [UDP]: UDP can use sk_hash to speedup lookups
    
    In a prior patch, I introduced a sk_hash field (__sk_common.skc_hash)  to let
    tcp lookups use one cache line per unmatched entry instead of two.
    
    We can also use sk_hash to speedup UDP part as well. We store in sk_hash the
    hnum value, and use sk->sk_hash (same cache line than 'next' pointer),
    instead of inet->num (different cache line)
    
    Note : We still have a false sharing problem for SMP machines, because
    sock_hold(sock) dirties the cache line containing the 'next' pointer. Not
    counting the udp_hash_lock rwlock. (did someone mentioned RCU ? :) )

    [CPUFREQ] Longhaul - Separate frequency and voltage transition
    
    This change should make Longhaul more compatible with
    both ver. 2 and Powersaver processors. Voltage transitions
    will be done before or after frequency transition. That depends
    on direction of change. I don't know how to force conservative
    governor when voltage scaling is enabled, so there is only
    a warning for user. Minimal voltage is calculated in different
    way now because in this way more power is saved at lower
    multipliers.

    [CPUFREQ] ondemand governor use new cpufreq rwsem locking in work callback
    
    Eliminate flush_workqueue in cpufreq_governor(STOP) callpath. Using flush
    there has a deadlock potential as in
    
    http://uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0611.3/1223.html
    
    Also, cleanup the locking issues with do_dbs_timer delayed_work callback.  As
    it changes the CPU frequency using __cpufreq_target, it needs to have
    policy_rwsem in write mode, which also protects it from hot plug.

    [CPUFREQ] Rewrite lock in cpufreq to eliminate cpufreq/hotplug related issues
    
    Yet another attempt to resolve cpufreq and hotplug locking issues.
    
    Patchset has 3 patches:
    * Rewrite the lock infrastructure of cpufreq using a per cpu rwsem.
    * Minor restructuring of work callback in ondemand driver.
    * Use the new cpufreq rwsem infrastructure in ondemand work.
    
    This patch:
    
    Convert policy->lock to rwsem and move it to per_cpu area.
    This rwsem will protect against both changing/accessing policy
    related parameters and CPU hot plug/unplug.

    [CPUFREQ] Enhanced PowerSaver driver
    
    This is driver for Enhanced Powersaver which is present in VIA C7
    processors. Beta tested by Jorgen (jorgen (at) greven dot dk).
    Thanks! Based on documentation provided by Dave Jones (Thanks!)
    and C7 Eden datasheet available from www.via.com.tw. Looks like all
    these C7 Eden CPU's don't have P-states in BIOS. I know that 2
    p-states is low, but Jorgen finds it usefull anyway because board
    is passive cooled.
    There are 3 different types of C7 processors (called brands):
    0. C7-M - these processors can set any maultiplier between min and
    max, any voltage between min and max.
    1. C7 - only min and max states are supported. Voltage is different
    for min and max states.
    2. Eden - only min and max states are supported. Looks like this
    brand can only change multiplier. Voltage seems to be the same for
    min and max frequency.

    This macro was used to save static registers before calling

    For the sys_sigreturn() case, there's no point to save them
    since they have been already saved by setup_sigcontext()
    before calling the signal handler.
    
    For the sys_sigsuspend() case, I don't see any reasons...

    [MIPS] signal32: no need to save c0_status register in setup_sigcontext32()
    
    All the information in the MIPS c0_status register is priviledged.
    Nothing that would constitute part of the thread context.
    
    The one flag one could possibly argument about might be c0_status.fr
    but none of the ABIs or tools or application software can make use
    of it.
    
    So for consistency with restore_sigcontext32(), which does not
    restore c0_status register, this patch remove the saving part.

    This patch makes 'struct sigframe' declaration avalaible for all signals

    IB/mthca: Work around gcc bug on sparc64
    
    For some reason gcc-3.4.5 on sparc64 does:
    
     WARNING: "____ilog2_NaN" [drivers/infiniband/hw/mthca/ib_mthca.ko] undefined!
    
    Points to note:
    
     (1) The asm volatile flush/flushw are just markers for viewing what comes out
         in the assembly; removing them has no effect on the result.
    
     (2) Changing almost anything else in dwh__mthca_arbel_init_srq_context() or
         dwh__mthca_alloc_srq() causes the problem to go away.
    
    The compiler command line issued by the kernel build is:
    
    /opt/crosstool/gcc-3.4.5-glibc-2.3.6/sparc64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/sparc64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -Os -m64 -mno-fpu -mcpu=ultrasparc -mcmodel=medlow -ffixed-g4 -ffixed-g5 -fcall-used-g7 -Wa,--undeclared-regs -pg -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fno-optimize-sibling-calls -fasynchronous-unwind-tables -g  -c -o drivers/infiniband/hw/mthca/.tmp_mthca_srq.o drivers/infiniband/hw/mthca/mthca_srq.c
    
    This can be reduced to this whilst still retaining the problem:
    
    /opt/crosstool/gcc-3.4.5-glibc-2.3.6/sparc64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/sparc64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc -m64 -c -o drivers/infiniband/hw/mthca/mthca_srq.o drivers/infiniband/hw/mthca/mthca_srq.c -Os
    
    Removing -Os or changing it to -O or -O0 thru -O6 gets rid of the problem.
    
    This patch to the kernel code fixes the problem:

    IPoIB: Connected mode experimental support
    
    The following patch adds experimental support for IPoIB connected
    mode, as defined by the draft from the IETF ipoib working group.  The
    idea is to increase performance by increasing the MTU from the maximum
    of 2K (theoretically 4K) supported by IPoIB on top of UD.  With this
    code, I'm able to get 800MByte/sec or more with netperf without
    options on a Mellanox 4x back-to-back DDR system.
    
    Some notes on code:
    1. SRQ is used for scalability to large cluster sizes
    2. Only RC connections are used (UC does not support SRQ now)
    3. Retry count is set to 0 since spec draft warns against retries
    4. Each connection is used for data transfers in only 1 direction, so
       each connection is either active(TX) or passive (RX).  2 sides that
       want to communicate create 2 connections.
    5. Each active (TX) connection has a separate CQ for send completions -
       this keeps the code simple without CQ resize and other tricks
    6. To detect stale passive side connections (where the remote side is
       down), we keep an LRU list of passive connections (updated once per
       second per connection) and destroy a connection after it has been
       unused for several seconds. The LRU rule makes it possible to avoid
       scanning connections that have recently been active.

    It makes it incrementally clearer to read the code when the top of a macro
    spaghetti-pile only receives the 3 arguments it uses, rather than 2 extra
    ones which are not used. Also when you start pulling this thread out of
    the sweater (i.e. remove unused args from XFS_BTREE_*_ADDR), a couple
    other third arms etc fall off too. If they're not used in the macro, then
    they sometimes don't need to be passed to the function calling the macro
    either, etc....

    [XFS] Fix callers of xfs_iozero() to zero the correct range.
    
    The problem is the two callers of xfs_iozero() are rounding out the range
    to be zeroed to the end of a fsb and in some cases this extends past the
    new eof. The call to commit_write() in xfs_iozero() will cause the Linux
    inode's file size to be set too high.

    [XFS] Ensure a frozen filesystem has a clean log before writing the dummy
    record.
    
    The current Linux XFS freeze code is a mess. We flush the metadata buffers
    out while we are still allowing new transactions to start and then fail to
    flush the dirty buffers back out before writing the unmount and dummy
    records to the log.
    
    This leads to problems when the frozen filesystem is used for snapshots -
    we do log recovery on a readonly image and often it appears that the log
    image in the snapshot is not correct. Hence we end up with hangs, oops and
    mount failures when trying to mount a snapshot image that has been created
    when the filesystem has not been correctly frozen.
    
    To fix this, we need to move th metadata flush to after we wait for all
    current transactions to complete in teh second stage of the freeze. This
    means that when we write the final log records, the log should be clean
    and recovery should never occur on a snapshot image created from a frozen
    filesystem.

    [XFS] Fix sub-block zeroing for buffered writes into unwritten extents.
    
    When writing less than a filesystem block of data into an unwritten extent
    via buffered I/O, __xfs_get_blocks fails to set the buffer new flag. As a
    result, the generic code will not zero either edge of the block resulting
    in garbage being written to disk either side of the real data. Set the
    buffer new state on bufferd writes to unwritten extents to ensure that
    zeroing occurs.

    [XFS] Reduction global superblock lock contention near ENOSPC.
    
    The existing per-cpu superblock counter code uses the global superblock
    spin lock when we approach ENOSPC for global synchronisation. On larger
    machines than this code was originally tested on this can still get
    catastrophic spinlock contention due increasing rebalance frequency near
    ENOSPC.
    
    By introducing a sleeping lock that is used to serialise balances and
    modifications near ENOSPC we prevent contention from needlessly from
    wasting the CPU time of potentially hundreds of CPUs.
    
    To reduce the number of balances occuring, we separate the need rebalance
    case from the slow allocate case. Now, a counter running dry will trigger
    a rebalance during which counters are disabled. Any thread that sees a
    disabled counter enters a different path where it waits on the new mutex.
    When it gets the new mutex, it checks if the counter is disabled. If the
    counter is disabled, then we _know_ that we have to use the global counter
    and lock and it is safe to do so immediately. Otherwise, we drop the mutex
    and go back to trying the per-cpu counters which we know were re-enabled.

    gcc-4.1 and more recent aggressively inline static functions which

    Also uninline some functions that are too large to be inlined and were

    Finally, clean up all the different users of inline, __inline and
    __inline__ and put them under one STATIC_INLINE macro. For debug kernels
    the STATIC_INLINE macro uninlines those functions.

    [XFS] Fix a synchronous buftarg flush deadlock when freezing.
    
    At the last stage of a freeze, we flush the buftarg synchronously over and
    over again until it succeeds twice without skipping any buffers.
    
    The delwri list flush skips pinned buffers, but tries to flush all others.
    It removes the buffers from the delwri list, then tries to lock them one
    at a time as it traverses the list to issue the I/O. It holds them locked
    until we issue all of the I/O and then unlocks them once we've waited for
    it to complete.
    
    The problem is that during a freeze, the filesystem may still be doing
    stuff - like flushing delalloc data buffers - in the background and hence
    we can be trying to lock buffers that were on the delwri list at the same
    time. Hence we can get ABBA deadlocks between threads doing allocation and
    the buftarg flush (freeze) thread.
    
    Fix it by skipping locked (and pinned) buffers as we traverse the delwri

    sata_nv: use ADMA for NODATA commands
    
    Some problems showed up recently with cache flush commands timing out on
    sata_nv.  Previously these commands were always handled by transitioning to
    legacy mode from ADMA mode first.  The timeout problem was worked around
    already by a change to the interrupt handling code for legacy mode, but for
    non-data commands like these it appears we can handle them in ADMA mode, so
    the switch to legacy mode is not needed.
    
    This patch changes the behavior so that we use ADMA mode to submit
    interrupt-driven commands with ATA_PROT_NODATA protocol.  In addition to
    avoiding the problem mentioned above entirely, this avoids the overhead of
    switching to legacy mode and back to ADMA mode for handling cache flushes.
    When handling non-DMA-mapped commands, we leave the APRD blank and clear
    the NV_CPB_CTL_APRD_VALID field in the CPB so the controller does not
    attempt to read it.

    sata_nv: cleanup ADMA error handling
    
    This cleans up a few issues with the error handling in sata_nv in ADMA mode
    to make it more consistent with other NCQ-capable drivers like ahci and
    sata_sil24:
    
    - When a command failed, we would effectively set AC_ERR_DEV on the
      queued command always.  In the case of NCQ commands this prevents libata
      from doing a log page query to determine the details of the failed
      command, since it thinks we've already analyzed.  Just set flags in the
      port ehi->err_mask, then freeze or abort and let libata figure out what
      went wrong.
    
    - The code handled NV_ADMA_STAT_CPBERR as a "really bad error" which
      caused it to set error flags on every queued command.  I don't know
      exactly what this flag means (no docs, grr!) but from what I can guess
      from the standard ADMA spec, it just means that one or more of the CPBs
      had an error, so we just need to go through and do our normal checks in
      this case.
    
    - In the error_handler function the code would always dump the state of
      all the CPBs.  This output seems redundant at this point since libata
      already dumps the state of all active commands on errors (and it also
      triggers at times when it shouldn't, like when suspending).  Take this
      out.

    libata: update libata LLDs to use devres
    
    Update libata LLDs to use devres.  Core layer is already converted to
    support managed LLDs.  This patch simplifies initialization and fixes
    many resource related bugs in init failure and detach path.  For
    example, all converted drivers now handle ata_device_add() failure
    gracefully without excessive resource rollback code.
    
    As most resources are released automatically on driver detach, many
    drivers don't need or can do with much simpler ->{port|host}_stop().
    In general, stop callbacks are need iff port or host needs to be given
    commands to shut it down.  Note that freezing is enough in many cases
    and ports are automatically frozen before being detached.

    devres: device resource management
    
    Implement device resource management, in short, devres.  A device
    driver can allocate arbirary size of devres data which is associated
    with a release function.  On driver detach, release function is
    invoked on the devres data, then, devres data is freed.
    
    devreses are typed by associated release functions.  Some devreses are
    better represented by single instance of the type while others need
    multiple instances sharing the same release function.  Both usages are
    supported.
    
    devreses can be grouped using devres group such that a device driver
    can easily release acquired resources halfway through initialization
    or selectively release resources (e.g. resources for port 1 out of 4
    ports).
    
    This patch adds devres core including documentation and the following
    managed interfaces.
    
    * alloc/free	: devm_kzalloc(), devm_kzfree()
    * IO region	: devm_request_region(), devm_release_region()
    * IRQ		: devm_request_irq(), devm_free_irq()

    sata_promise: handle ATAPI_NODATA ourselves
    
    This patch extends sata_promise to handle ATAPI_NODATA
    commands internally. However, commands destined to
    ATA_DFLAG_CDB_INTR devices are excluded from this and
    continue to be returned to libata.
    
    Concrete changes:
    - pdc_atapi_dma_pkt() is renamed to pdc_atapi_pkt(), and is
      extended to set up correct headers for NODATA packets
    - pdc_qc_prep() calls pdc_atapi_pkt() for ATAPI_NODATA
    - pdc_host_intr() handles ATAPI_NODATA
    - pdc_qc_issue_prot() sends ATAPI_NODATA packets via the
      chip's packet mechanism, except for CDB_INTR devices
    
    Tested on first- and second-generation chips, SATAPI and PATAPI,
    with no observable regressions.

    sata_promise: issue ATAPI commands as normal packets
    
    This patch (against libata #upstream + the ATAPI cleanup patch)
    reimplements sata_promise's ATAPI support to format ATAPI DMA
    commands as normal packets, and to issue them via the hardware's
    normal packet machinery.
    
    It turns out that the only reason for issuing ATAPI DMA
    commands via the pdc_issue_atapi_pkt_cmd() procedure was to
    perform two interrupt-fiddling steps for ATA_DFLAG_CDB_INTR
    devices. But these steps aren't needed because sata_promise
    sets ATA_FLAG_PIO_POLLING, which disables DMA for those devices.
    The remaining steps can easily be done in ATA taskfile packets.
    
    Concrete changes:
    - pdc_atapi_dma_pkt() is extended to program all packet setup
      steps, and not just contain the CDB; the sequence of steps
      exactly mirrors what pdc_issue_atapi_pkt_cmd() did
    - pdc_atapi_dma_pkt() needed more parameters: simplify it by
      just passing 'qc' and having it extract the data it needs
    - pdc_issue_atai_pkt_cmd() and its two helper procedures
      pdc_wait_for_drq() and pdc_wait_on_busy() are removed
    
    Tested on first- and second-generation chips, SATAPI and PATAPI,
    with no observable regressions.

    libata-sff: Don't try and activate channels which are not in use
    
    An ATA controller in native mode may have one or more channels disabled
    and not assigned resources. In that case the existing code crashes trying
    to access I/O ports 0-7.
    
    Add the neccessary check.

    sata_promise: ATAPI support
    
    This patch adds ATAPI support to the sata_promise driver.
    This has been tested on both first- and second-generation
    chips (20378 and 20575), and with both SATAPI and PATAPI
    devices. CD-writing works.
    
    SATAPI DMA works on second-generation chips, but on
    first-generation chips SATAPI is limited to PIO due
    to what appears to be HW limitations.
    PATAPI DMA works on both first- and second-generation
    chips, but requires the separate PATA support patch
    before it can be used on TX2plus chips.
    
    The functional changes to the driver are:
    - remove ATA_FLAG_NO_ATAPI from PDC_COMMON_FLAGS
    - add ->check_atapi_dma() operation to enable DMA for bulk data
      transfers but force PIO for other ATAPI commands; this filter
      is from Promise's driver and largely matches pata_pdc207x.c
    - use a more restrictive ->check_atapi_dma() on first-generation
      chips to force SATAPI to always use PIO
    - add handling of ATAPI protocols to pdc_qc_prep(), pdc_host_intr(),
      and pdc_qc_issue_prot(): ATAPI_DMA is handled by the driver
      while non-DMA protocols are handed over to libata generic code
    - add pdc_issue_atapi_pkt_cmd() to handle the initial steps in
      issuing ATAPI DMA commands before sending the actual CDB;
      this procedure was ported from Promise's driver

    sata_promise: TX2plus PATA support
    
    This patch implements a simple way of setting up per-port
    flags on the SATA+PATA Promise TX2plus chips, which is a
    prerequisite for supporting the PATA port on those chips.
    
    It is based on the observation that ap->flags isn't really
    used until after ->port_start() has been invoked. So it
    places the "exceptional" per-port flags array in the driver's
    private host structure, and uses it in ->port_start() to
    finalise the port's flags.
    
    This patch obsoletes the #promise-sata-pata branch included
    in the #all branch.

    [PATCH] uclinux: correctly remap bin_fmtflat exe allocated mem regions
    
    remap() the region we get from mmap() to mark the fact that we are
    using all of the available slack space. Any slack space is used
    to form a simple brk region, and potentially more stack space than
    requested at load time.
    
    Any searches of the vma chain may well fail looking for
    stack (and especially arg) addresses if the remaping is not done.
    The simplest example is /proc/<pid>/cmdline, since the args
    are pretty much always at the top of the data/bss/stack region.

    [POWERPC] Update to linkstation / kurobox support
    
    Linkstation systems capable of running mainline kernels use u-boot as a
    bootloader, so, specifying a suitable kernel command is not a problem.
    Don't guess. Also extend linkstation_defconfig to support the linkstation HS
    model with a IT8212 IDE controller and kuroboxHD/HD-HLAN linkstation
    models with a tulip ethernet chip. The latter also require a slightly
    different .dts file, which is also included with this patch.

    [PATCH] md: avoid possible BUG_ON in md bitmap handling
    
    md/bitmap tracks how many active write requests are pending on blocks
    associated with each bit in the bitmap, so that it knows when it can clear
    the bit (when count hits zero).
    
    The counter has 14 bits of space, so if there are ever more than 16383, we
    cannot cope.
    
    Currently the code just calles BUG_ON as "all" drivers have request queue
    limits much smaller than this.
    
    However is seems that some don't.  Apparently some multipath configurations
    can allow more than 16383 concurrent write requests.
    
    So, in this unlikely situation, instead of calling BUG_ON we now wait
    for the count to drop down a bit.  This requires a new wait_queue_head,
    some waiting code, and a wakeup call.
    
    Tested by limiting the counter to 20 instead of 16383 (writes go a lot slower
    in that case...).

    [PATCH] knfsd: fix a race in closing NFSd connections
    
    If you lose this race, it can iput a socket inode twice and you get a BUG
    in fs/inode.c
    
    When I added the option for user-space to close a socket, I added some
    cruft to svc_delete_socket so that I could call that function when closing
    a socket per user-space request.
    
    This was the wrong thing to do.  I should have just set SK_CLOSE and let
    normal mechanisms do the work.
    
    Not only wrong, but buggy.  The locking is all wrong and it openned up a
    race where-by a socket could be closed twice.
    
    So this patch:
      Introduces svc_close_socket which sets SK_CLOSE then either leave
      the close up to a thread, or calls svc_delete_socket if it can
      get SK_BUSY.
    
      Adds a bias to sk_busy which is removed when SK_DEAD is set,
      This avoid races around shutting down the socket.
    
      Changes several 'spin_lock' to 'spin_lock_bh' where the _bh
      was missing.

    [PATCH] md: fix various bugs with aligned reads in RAID5
    
    It is possible for raid5 to be sent a bio that is too big for an underlying
    device.  So if it is a READ that we pass stright down to a device, it will
    fail and confuse RAID5.
    
    So in 'chunk_aligned_read' we check that the bio fits within the parameters
    for the target device and if it doesn't fit, fall back on reading through
    the stripe cache and making lots of one-page requests.
    
    Note that this is the earliest time we can check against the device because
    earlier we don't have a lock on the device, so it could change underneath
    us.
    
    Also, the code for handling a retry through the cache when a read fails has
    not been tested and was badly broken.  This patch fixes that code.

    [PATCH] hugetlb: preserve hugetlb pte dirty state
    
    __unmap_hugepage_range() is buggy that it does not preserve dirty state of
    huge_pte when unmapping hugepage range.  It causes data corruption in the
    event of dop_caches being used by sys admin.  For example, an application
    creates a hugetlb file, modify pages, then unmap it.  While leaving the
    hugetlb file alive, comes along sys admin doing a "echo 3 >
    /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches".
    
    drop_pagecache_sb() will happily free all pages that aren't marked dirty if
    there are no active mapping.  Later when application remaps the hugetlb
    file back and all data are gone, triggering catastrophic flip over on
    application.
    
    Not only that, the internal resv_huge_pages count will also get all messed
    up.  Fix it up by marking page dirty appropriately.

    [PATCH] ufs: restore back support of openstep
    
    This is a fix of regression, which triggered by ~2.6.16.
    
    Patch with name ufs-directory-and-page-cache-from-blocks-to-pages.patch: in
    additional to conversation from block to page cache mechanism added new
    checks of directory integrity, one of them that directory entry do not
    across directory chunks.
    
    But some kinds of UFS: OpenStep UFS and Apple UFS (looks like these are the
    same filesystems) have different directory chunk size, then common
    UFSes(BSD and Solaris UFS).
    
    So this patch adds ability to works with variable size of directory chunks,
    and set it for ufstype=openstep to right size.
    
    Tested on darwin ufs.

    The usage of the century bit was inverted on 2.6.19 following to PCF8563's

    is to detect its polarity in get_datetime routine.  The default value of
    c_polarity is 0 (MO_C=1 means 19xx) so that this patch does not change
    current behavior even if get_datetime was not called before set_datetime.

    [PATCH] kill eth_io_copy_and_sum()
    
    On all targets that sucker boils down to memcpy_fromio(sbk->data, from, len).
    The function name is highly misguiding (it _never_ does any checksums), the
    last argument is just a noise and simply expanding the call to memcpy_fromio()
    gives shorter and more readable source.  For a lot of reasons it has almost
    no remaining users, so it's better to just outright kill it.

    [TC] dec_esp: Driver model for the PMAZ-A
    
    This is a set of changes that converts the PMAZ-A support to the driver model.
    
    The use of the driver model required switching to the hotplug SCSI
    initialization model, which in turn required a change to the core NCR53C9x
    driver.  I decided not to break all the frontend drivers and introduced an
    additional parameter for esp_allocate() to select between the old and the new
    model.  I hope this is OK, but I would be fine with converting NCR53C9x to the
    new model unconditionally as long as I do not have to fix all the other
    frontends (OK, perhaps I could do some of them ;-) ).

    [JFFS2] Use MTD_OOB_AUTO to automatically place cleanmarker on NAND
    
    Nowadays MTD supports an MTD_OOB_AUTO option which allows users
    to access free bytes in NAND's OOB as a contiguous buffer, although
    it may be highly discontinuous.
    
    This patch teaches JFFS2 to use this nice feature instead of the
    old MTD_OOB_PLACE option. This for example caused problems with
    OneNAND. Now JFFS2 does not care how are the free bytes situated.
    
    This may change position of the clean marker on some flashes,
    but this is not a problem. JFFS2 will just re-erase the empty
    eraseblocks and write the new (correct) clean marker.

    [AVR32] ext int fixes
    
    Bugfixes for external irq handler set_irq_type():
    
     - If set_irq_type() can't set the type, don't change anything!
    
     - It's not OK to change the flow handler as part of set_irq_type(),
       among other issues that violates spinlock rules.  Instead, we can
       call the relevant handler when we demux the external interrupts.
    
     - The external irq demux has no need to grab the spinlock.  And in
       fact grabbing it that way was wrong, since that code might be
       pre-empted by an irq at a different priority level, and that code
       might then have tried to grab that spinlock...

    [ALSA] aoa i2sbus: Stop Apple i2s DMA gracefully
    
    This fixes the problem of getting extra bytes inserted at the
    beginning of a recording when using the Apple i2s interface and DBDMA
    controller.  It turns out that we can't just abort the DMA; we have to
    let it stop at the end of a command, and then wait for the S7 bit to
    be set before turning off the DBDMA controller.  Doing that for
    playback doesn't seem to be necessary, but doesn't hurt either.
    We use the technique used by the Darwin driver: make each transfer
    command branch to a stop command if the S0 status bit is set.  Thus we
    can ask the DMA controller to stop at the end of the current command
    by setting S0.
    The interrupt routine now looks at and clears the status word of the
    DBDMA command ring.  This is necessary so it can know when the DBDMA
    controller has seen that S0 is set, and so when it should look for the
    DBDMA controller being stopped and S7 being set.  This also ended up
    simplifying the calculation in i2sbus_pcm_pointer.
    Tested on a 15 inch albook.
    [Addition by Johannes]
    I modified this patch and added the suspend/resume bits to it to get my
    powermac into a decent state when playing sound across suspend to disk
    that has a different bitrate from what the firmware programs the
    hardware to.
    I also added the SNDRV_PCM_INFO_JOINT_DUPLEX flag because it seemed the
    right thing to do and I was looking at the info stuff.

    MIDI and recording seem to work perfectly (with JACK), but playback

    [ALSA] hda-intel - Add black/whitelist for position_fix option
    
    Some devices are known to require position_fix=1 or 2 to make the
    driver working correctly.  Otherwise the sound gets weird effects,
    such as stutters.
    Now a black/whitelist is introduced to indicate the position_fix
    value explicitly for such misbehaving hardwares.  As a first example,
    Dell D820 is listed there.  More will come later likely...

    [ALSA] ASoC force running of delayed PM work at suspend() and remove()
    
    This patch fixes a bug whereby the power management delayed work would
    never be run at driver suspend() or module remove(). Delayed work would
    be created (after audio had finished) with a long delay (~5 secs) and
    was sometimes never queued before flush_scheduled_work() was being
    called at suspend or module remove. This caused the delayed work to
    queued after the module had been removed or after resume.
    This patch forces any delayed work to complete by cancelling it (timer
    cannot fire and add it to queue later), scheduling it for now and
    waiting on it's completion.
    This is something I probably would like to add to workqueue.c in the
    next merge window, however it's here atm because it can oops.

    Fix ABI for older ld10k1.  When no EMU10K1_PVERSION ioctl is issued,
    the driver accepts ioctls with the old struct size without TLV information.
    Also, changed the struct field to make the conversion easier from the

    [ALSA] ac97 - fix various issues with AD1986/AD1986A support
    
    Previously, ac97_codec.c was coded to support AD1986 and AD1986A
    CODECs using code written for the AD1985 CODEC.  This allowed the
    LINE_OUT and HEADPHONE jacks to function properly, however register
    differences between the CODECs prevented line and microphone inputs
    from functioning.
    Specifically, this patch fixes issues with the following mixer
    controls:  'V_REFOUT', 'Spread Front to Surround and Center/LFE',
    'Exchange Front/Surround', 'Surround Jack Mode', and 'Channel Mode'.
    This patch removes the undocumented AD1888 control
    'High Pass Filter Enable' and adds the new control
    'Exchange Mic/Line In'.

    [ALSA] ac97 - fix malfunctioning mixer controls for AD1985
    
    This patch replaces the 'V_REFOUT Enable' mixer switch control
    with a listbox control for the AD1985 CODEC.
    Previous patch 'AD1888 mixer controls for DC mode' added
    controls that were propogated to multiple codecs.  For the
    AD1985 codec, the bits VREFH and VREFD function differently,
    preventing the 'V_REFOUT Enable' control from setting V_REFOUT
    to Hi-Z.
    This patch also corrects an issue in which register bits relating
    to mixer controls 'Surround Jack Mode' and 'Channel Mode'.
    The register bits controlled by these controls were being set
    at boot time to states inconsistent with the stored values of
    these controls.

    [ALSA] ac97 - fix microphone and line_in selection logic
    
    This patch fixes the Microphone and LINE_IN select logic for
    Analog Devices surround codecs with shared jacks.  The existing
    code can never utilize the shared jacks for Microphone and LINE_IN
    due to the reversed jack selection logic.  The patched code
    correctly selects the shared jack for input if the 'Channel Mode'
    selector does not specify that the jack is to be used for output.
    Specifically, in '2ch' mode the Center/LFE jack is used for
    microphone input and the Surround jack is used for LINE_IN,
    in '4ch' mode the Center/LFE jack is used for microphone input
    and the Surround jack is used for output, and in '6ch' mode
    both jacks are used for output.

    [ALSA] Remove AC97 POP control for STAC9708/11
    
    The STAC9708/11 AC97 codecs implement the PCM Out Path & Mute bit in
    the General Purpose register (0x20:F), even though they don't implement
    the actual function in the mixer.
    Since the alsa tests for the function by toggling the bit and reading
    it back to see if it changed, it mistakenly creates a useless control.
    This patch explicitly removes the control when the codec is an
    STAC9708/11.
    I put the check in patch_sigmatel_stac9708_specific(), because I have
    an SBLive with this chip on it. I don't know if the STAC9758 or other
    codecs also behave this way. If they do, then this check could maybe go
    in patch_sigmatel_stac97xx_specific(), or some other more general
    function.

    [ALSA] snd-aoa: fix onyx resume
    
    When the machine resumes the onyx codec might be in a weird state. Hence,
    simply fully reset it once (and keep the code to take it out of suspend in
    case the suspend of the codec chip survives a reset).

    [ALSA] Fix the soc code after dhowells workqueue changes.
    
    From: Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org>
    I converted the workqueues to per-device while I was there.  It seems
    strange to create a new kernel thread (on each CPU!) and to then only
    have a single global work to ever be queued upon it.
    Plus without this, I'd have to use the _NAR stuff, gawd help me.
    Does that workqueue really need to be per-cpu?
    Does that workqueue really need to exist?  Why not use keventd?

    [ALSA] hda-codec - Make internal speaker work on Acer C20x tablets
    
    The following patch creates a new 'Mono speaker' control in alsamixer
    when the Realtek 'acer' model is used with hda_intel.  This is needed so
    the internal mono speaker (when present) can be controlled.
    This new control won't do anything in Acer laptops which are not fitted with
    a mono speaker. Acer models which are known to have a mono speaker are the
    C20x tablet series but there may be others.  I guess we could define a new
    model specifically for Acers with mono speakers but this seems a bit silly
    given that such a model will be identical to the normal 'acer' model except
    for this added control.
    This patch also adds the C20x tablets to the list of PCI ids associated with
    the 'acer' model.  This means that owners of C20x machines will no longer
    have to supply 'model=acer' when loading hda_intel.

    [ALSA] ASoC: dynamic audio power management (DAPM)
    
    This patch adds Dynamic Audio Power Management (DAPM) to ASoC.
    Dynamic Audio Power Management (DAPM) is designed to allow portable and
    handheld Linux devices to use the minimum amount of power within the
    audio subsystem at all times. It is independent of other kernel PM and
    as such, can easily co-exist with the other PM systems.
    DAPM is also completely transparent to all user space applications as
    all power switching is done within the ASoC core. No code changes or
    recompiling are required for user space applications. DAPM makes power
    switching decisions based upon any audio stream (capture/playback)
    activity and audio mixer settings within the device.
    DAPM spans the whole machine. It covers power control within the entire
    audio subsystem, this includes internal codec power blocks and machine
    level power systems.
    There are 4 power domains within DAPM:-
    1. Codec domain - VREF, VMID (core codec and audio power)
    Usually controlled at codec probe/remove and suspend/resume, although
    can be set at stream time if power is not needed for sidetone, etc.
    2. Platform/Machine domain - physically connected inputs and outputs
    Is platform/machine and user action specific, is configured by the
    machine driver and responds to asynchronous events e.g when HP are
    inserted
    3. Path domain - audio subsystem signal paths
    Automatically set when mixer and mux settings are changed by the user.
    e.g. alsamixer, amixer.
    4. Stream domain - DAC's and ADC's.
    Enabled and disabled when stream playback/capture is started and stopped
    respectively. e.g. aplay, arecord.
    All DAPM power switching decisions are made automatically by consulting
    an audio routing map of the whole machine. This map is specific to each
    machine and consists of the interconnections between every audio
    component (including internal codec components).

    [ALSA] ASoC: core code
    
    This patch is the core of ASoC functionality.
    The ASoC core is designed to provide the following features :-
    o  Codec independence. Allows reuse of codec drivers on other platforms
    and machines.
    o Platform driver code reuse. Reuse of platform specific audio DMA and
    DAI drivers on different machines.
    o Easy I2S/PCM digital audio interface configuration between codec and
    SoC. Each SoC interface and codec registers their audio interface
    capabilities with the core at initialisation. The capabilities are
    subsequently matched and configured at run time for best power and
    performance when the application hw params are known.
     o Machine specific controls/operations: Allow machines to add controls
    and operations to the audio subsystem. e.g. volume control for speaker
    amp.
    To achieve all this, ASoC splits an embedded audio system into 3
    components :-
    1. Codec driver: The codec driver is platform independent and contains
    audio controls, audio interface capabilities, codec dapm and codec IO
    functions.
    2. Platform driver: The platform driver contains the audio dma engine
    and audio interface drivers (e.g. I2S, AC97, PCM) for that platform.
    3. Machine driver: The machine driver handles any machine specific
    controls and audio events. i.e. turning on an amp at start of playback.

    OneNAND double-density package (DDP) has two chips, each with
    their own bufferRAM.  The driver will skip loading data from
    the NAND core if the data can be found in a bufferRAM, however
    in that case, the correct chip's bufferRAM must be selected
    before reading from bufferRAM.

    [PATCH] PA-RISC: Fix bogus warnings from modpost
    
    parisc and parisc64 seem to name sections a little differently from other
    targets.  parisc64 gives spurious warnings like:
    
    WARNING: drivers/net/dummy.o - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text:dummy_setup from .data.rel.ro between '.LC1' (at offset 0x0) and '.LC6'
    
    and parisc gives spurious warnings like:
    
    WARNING: drivers/net/dummy.o - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text:dummy_setup from .rodata.cst4 between '.LC1' (at offset 0x0) and '.LC6'
    
    Given the other comments in modpost.c, it seems that the best solution is
    to move rodata down to the 'match at start of name' section and add
    .data.rel.ro to the 'match entire name' section.

    sock_from_file() either returns filp->private_data or it
    sets *err and returns NULL.
    
    Callers return "err" on NULL, but filp->private_data could
    be NULL.
    
    Some minor rearrangements of error handling in sys_sendto

    [NET]: cleanup sock_from_file()
    
    I believe dead code from sock_from_file() can be cleaned up.
    
    All sockets are now built using sock_attach_fd(), that puts the 'sock' pointer
    into file->private_data and &socket_file_ops into file->f_op
    
    I could not find a place where file->private_data could be set to NULL,
    keeping opened the file.
    
    So to get 'sock' from a 'file' pointer, either :
    
    - This is a socket file (f_op == &socket_file_ops), and we can directly get
    'sock' from private_data.
    - This is not a socket, we return -ENOTSOCK and dont even try to find a socket
    via dentry/inode :)

    [NET]: change layout of ehash table
    
    ehash table layout is currently this one :
    
    First half of this table is used by sockets not in TIME_WAIT state
    Second half of it is used by sockets in TIME_WAIT state.
    
    This is non optimal because of for a given hash or socket, the two chain heads
    are located in separate cache lines.
    Moreover the locks of the second half are never used.
    
    If instead of this halving, we use two list heads in inet_ehash_bucket instead
    of only one, we probably can avoid one cache miss, and reduce ram usage,
    particularly if sizeof(rwlock_t) is big (various CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK,
    CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC settings). So we still halves the table but we keep
    together related chains to speedup lookups and socket state change.
    
    In this patch I did not try to align struct inet_ehash_bucket, but a future
    patch could try to make this structure have a convenient size (a power of two
    or a multiple of L1_CACHE_SIZE).
    I guess rwlock will just vanish as soon as RCU is plugged into ehash :) , so
    maybe we dont need to scratch our heads to align the bucket...
    
    Note : In case struct inet_ehash_bucket is not a power of two, we could
    probably change alloc_large_system_hash() (in case it use __get_free_pages())
    to free the unused space. It currently allocates a big zone, but the last
    quarter of it could be freed. Again, this should be a temporary 'problem'.
    
    Patch tested on ipv4 tcp only, but should be OK for IPV6 and DCCP.

    [ARM] 4154/1: AT91: Clock update
    
    Unconditionally disabling the PCKs (Programmable Clocks) is not a good
    idea as it breaks boards that depend on those clocks being enabled by
    bootloaders.
    Therefore only disable unused clocks late in the init process, giving
    the board init code the chance to claim the clock.
    
    Patch from Steven Scholz.
    
    Since the HCK clocks on SAM9261 are already being registered as a
    independent clocks, we don't need the special case for HCK0 on the
    SAM9261.  Platform-init code and drivers should use the clock API to
    enable/disable the clock.
    
    Patch from Nicolas Ferre.

    [ARM] Always mark ARMv6 PTWs outer cacheable
    
    Other platforms other than SMP may have an outer cache.  For these, we
    also need to mark the page table walks outer cacheable.  Since marking
    the walks always outer cacheable apparantly has no side effects, we
    might as well always mark them so.
    
    However, we continue to only mark PTWs shared if we have SMP enabled.

    [ATM]: Fix for crash in adummy_init()
    
    This was reported by Ingo Molnar here,
    
    http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/18/119
    
    The problem is that adummy_init() depends on atm_init() , but adummy_init()
    is called first.
    
    So I put atm_init() into subsys_initcall which seems appropriate, and it
    will still get module_init() if it becomes a module.
    
    Interesting to note that you could crash your system here if you just load

    [NET]: user of the jiffies rounding code: Networking
    
    This patch introduces users of the round_jiffies() function in the
    networking code.
    
    These timers all were of the "about once a second" or "about once
    every X seconds" variety and several showed up in the "what wakes the
    cpu up" profiles that the tickless patches provide.  Some timers are
    highly dynamic based on network load; but even on low activity systems
    they still show up so the rounding is done only in cases of low
    activity, allowing higher frequency timers in the high activity case.
    
    The various hardware watchdogs are an obvious case; they run every 2
    seconds but aren't otherwise specific of exactly when they need to
    run.

    [TCP]: Check num sacks in SACK fast path
    
    We clear the unused parts of the SACK cache, This prevents us from mistakenly
    taking the cache data if the old data in the SACK cache is the same as the data
    in the SACK block. This assumes that we never receive an empty SACK block with
    start and end both at zero.

    [TCP]: Seperate DSACK from SACK fast path
    
    Move DSACK code outside the SACK fast-path checking code. If the DSACK
    determined that the information was too old we stayed with a partial cache
    copied. Most likely this matters very little since the next packet will not be
    DSACK and we will find it in the cache. but it's still not good form and there
    is little reason to couple the two checks.
    
    Since the SACK receive cache doesn't need the data to be in host order we also
    remove the ntohl in the checking loop.

    [PACKET]: Fix skb->cb clobbering between aux and sockaddr
    
    Both aux data and sockaddr tries to use the same buffer which

    the skb->cb if you take away the maximum length of sockaddr_ll.
    That's just enough to store the one piece of info from aux data

    [PACKET]: Add optional checksum computation for recvmsg
    
    This patch is needed to make ISC's DHCP server (and probably other
    DHCP servers/clients using AF_PACKET) to be able to serve another
    client on the same Xen host.
    
    The problem is that packets between different domains on the same
    Xen host only have partial checksums.  Unfortunately this piece of
    information is not passed along in AF_PACKET unless you're using
    the mmap interface.  Since dhcpd doesn't support packet-mmap, UDP
    packets from the same host come out with apparently bogus checksums.
    
    This patch adds a mechanism for AF_PACKET recvmsg(2) to return the
    status along with the packet.  It does so by adding a new cmsg that
    contains this information along with some other relevant data such
    as the original packet length.
    
    I didn't include the time stamp information since there is already
    a cmsg for that.
    
    This patch also changes the mmap code to set the CSUMNOTREADY flag
    on all packets instead of just outoing packets on cooked sockets.

    Unloading the low-level driver module of a FireWire host can lead to

    is closed.
    
    This feature wouldn't be relevant if "modprobe -r video1394" or

    ieee1394: sbp2: lower block queue alignment requirement
    
    The old setting is copy & waste from usb-storage and doesn't apply to

    for S/G table elements which have to be 8-byte aligned according to the
    SBP-2 spec.  (They happen to be ____cacheline_aligned in our
    implementation.  Whether that's good is another question.)
    
    We now simply don't tune block queue alignment at all.  The default
    alignment would surely never become anything else than a multiple of 4,
    else tons of calls to blk_queue_dma_alignment would have to be added

    [ARM] 4151/1: AT91 / AVR32: Move at91_pdc.h to linux/atmel_pdc.h
    
    The Atmel AT91 and AVR32 processor architectures share many of the same
    peripherals.  The PDC (Peripheral Data Controller) registers are also
    implemented within in a number of the on-chip peripherals (eg, USART,
    MMC, SPI, SSC, etc).
    
    In a attempt not to duplicate the register definitions in each
    peripheral, or in each architecture, the at91_pdc.h header in
    asm-arm/arch-at91 and asm-avr32/arch-at32ap has been replaced with
    linux/atmel_pdc.h.
    
    The definitions have also been renamed from AT91_PDC_* to ATMEL_PDC_*,
    and the drivers updated accordingly.

    [ARM] 4141/1: consolidate functions that handles gpio in pxa2xx_udc
    
    This patch renames pxa_gpio_set/get functions defined in drivers/usb/gadget/pxa2xx_udc.h to udc_gpio_set/get.
    
    These functions are moved from drivers/usb/gadget/pxa2xx_udc.h to include/asm-arm/arch-pxa2xx/udc.h
    
    Creates new functions: udc_gpio_to_irq, udc_gpio_init_vbus, udc_gpio_init_pullup in include/asm-arm/arch-pxa2xx/udc.h. These functions are used in drivers/usb/gadget/pxa2xx_udc.c instead of direct low-level (pxa2xx only) functions.
    
    Creates all these udc_gpio_* functions in include/asm-arm/arch-ixp4xx/udc.h. This implementation has no real code because ixp4xx doesn't use vbus - only vbus uses all these gpio functions (and because ixp4xx misses any function which converts number of gpio pin into it's irq).
    
    This is next step to make pxa2xx_udc fully work on ixp4xx platform.

    [ARM] 4143/1: AT91: Prepare for AT91SAM9263 support
    
    The Atmel AT91SAM9263 processor includes many more integrated
    peripherals than Atmel's previous ARM9-based AT91 processors, so this
    has necessitated a few changes to the core AT91 support.
    
    These changes are:
          * The system peripheral I/O region we remap has increased from
            0xFFFA0000..0xFFFFFFFF to 0xFFF78000..0xFFFFFFFF.
          * The increased I/O region forces changes to entry-macro.S and
            debug-macro.S due to ARM's limited immediate offset addressing
            modes.
          * Maximum number of GPIO banks increases to 5.
          * 2 MMC controllers so the board-setup code needs to specify which
            controller it wishes to use when calling at91_add_device_mmc().

    [ARM] 4119/1: AT91: Fix build of AT91SAM9260
    
    Fix build failure of AT91SAM9260.
    
    The AT91RM9200 ethernet driver (at91_ether.c) stores platform data in a
    "struct at91_eth_data" structure, but the AT91SAM9260 (and AT91SAM9263)
    ethernet driver (macb.c) [developed on the AVR32 architecture] expects a
    "struct eth_platform_data".
    
    Since the platform data of the two drivers is very similar, we continue
    to use the "struct at91_eth_data" for all AT91 processors but add a
        #define eth_platform_data      at91_eth_data
    in board.h to keep the MACB driver happy.

    kbuild: make $(checker-shell ) strip spaces around the result
    
    It looks like GNU make version 3.80 (but apparently not 3.81) adds
    leading whitespace to the result of the checker-shell execution.  This
    strips them off explicitly.
    
    Also, don't bother symlinking the output file to /dev/null.  It's likely
    as expensive as just writing the temp-file, and we need to remove it
    anyway afterwards.

    drm: update core memory manager from git drm tree
    
    Remove the memory manager parameter from the put_block function, as this
    makes the client code a lot cleaner. Prepare buffer manager for lock and
    unlock calls.
    Fix buggy aligned allocations.
    Remove the stupid root_node field from the core memory manager.
    Support multi-page buffer offset alignments
    Add improved alignment functionality to the core memory manager.
    This makes an allocated block actually align itself and returns any
    wasted space to the manager.

    msi: Make MSI useable more architectures
    
    The arch hooks arch_setup_msi_irq and arch_teardown_msi_irq are now
    responsible for allocating and freeing the linux irq in addition to
    setting up the the linux irq to work with the interrupt.
    
    arch_setup_msi_irq now takes a pci_device and a msi_desc and returns
    an irq.
    
    With this change in place this code should be useable by all platforms
    except those that won't let the OS touch the hardware like ppc RTAS.

    msi: Kill the msi_desc array.
    
    We need to be able to get from an irq number to a struct msi_desc.
    The msi_desc array in msi.c had several short comings the big one was
    that it could not be used outside of msi.c.  Using irq_data in struct
    irq_desc almost worked except on some architectures irq_data needs to
    be used for something else.
    
    So this patch adds a msi_desc pointer to irq_desc, adds the appropriate
    wrappers and changes all of the msi code to use them.
    
    The dynamic_irq_init/cleanup code was tweaked to ensure the new
    field is left in a well defined state.

    msi: Remove msi_lock.
    
    With the removal of msi_lookup_irq all of the functions using msi_lock
    operated on a single device and none of them could reasonably be
    called on that device at the same time.
    
    Since what little synchronization that needs to happen needs to happen
    outside of the msi functions, msi_lock could never be contended and as
    such is useless and just complicates the code.

    msi: Kill msi_lookup_irq
    
    The function msi_lookup_irq was horrible.  As a side effect of running
    it changed dev->irq, and then the callers would need to change it
    back.  In addition it does a global scan through all of the irqs,
    which seems to be the sole justification of the msi_lock.
    
    To remove the neede for msi_lookup_irq I added first_msi_irq to struct
    pci_dev.  Then depending on the context I replaced msi_lookup_irq with
    dev->first_msi_irq, dev->msi_enabled, or dev->msix_enabled.
    
    msi_enabled and msix_enabled were already present in pci_dev for other
    reasons.

    MSI: Combine pci_(save|restore)_msi/msix_state
    
    The PCI save/restore code doesn't need to care about MSI vs MSI-X, all
    it really wants is to say "save/restore all MSI(-X) info for this device".
    
    This is borne out in the code, we call the MSI and MSI-X save routines
    side by side, and similarly with the restore routines.
    
    So combine the MSI/MSI-X routines into pci_save_msi_state() and
    pci_restore_msi_state(). It is up to those routines to decide what state
    needs to be saved.

    MSI: Replace pci_msi_quirk with calls to pci_no_msi()
    
    I don't see any reason why we need pci_msi_quirk, quirk code can just
    call pci_no_msi() instead.
    
    Remove the check of pci_msi_quirk in msi_init(). This is safe as all
    calls to msi_init() are protected by calls to pci_msi_supported(),
    which checks pci_msi_enable, which is disabled by pci_no_msi().
    
    The pci_disable_msi routines didn't check pci_msi_quirk, only
    pci_msi_enable, but as far as I can see that was a bug not a feature.

    PCI Quirk: 1k I/O space IOBL_ADR fix on P64H2
    
    There's an existing quirk for the kernel to use 1k IO space granularity
    on the Intel P64H2.  It turns out however that pci_setup_bridge() in
    drivers/pci/setup-bus.c reads in the IO base and limit address register
    masks it off to the nearest 4k, and writes it back.  This causes the
    kernel to be on 1k boundaries and the hardware to be 4k aligned.  The
    patch below fixes the problem.

    So let's mark it as __deprecated now, which also has the side effect
    that noone can later whine that removing it might break some shiny
    external modules.
    
    Oh, and if anything starts complaining "But this adds some warnings to
    my kernel build!", he should either first fix the 200 kB (sic) of
    warnings I'm getting in 2.6.19-rc5-mm2 starting at MODPOST or go to hell.

    PCI : Add selected_regions funcs
    
    This patch adds the following changes into generic PCI code especially
    for PCI legacy I/O port free drivers.
    
         - Added new pci_request_selected_regions() and
           pci_release_selected_regions() for PCI legacy I/O port free
           drivers in order to request/release only the selected regions.
    
         - Added helper routine pci_select_bars() which makes proper mask
           of BARs from the specified resource type. This would be very
           helpful for users of pci_enable_device_bars().

    PCI: check szhi when sz is 0 when 64 bit iomem bigger than 4G
    
    For pci mem resource that size is bigger than 4G, the sz returned by
    pc_size will be 0.
    So that resource is skipped, and register contained hi address will be
    treated as another 32bit resource. We need to use sz64 and pci_sz64 for
    64 bit resource for clear logical.  Typical usages for this: Opteron
    system with co-processor and the co-processor could take more than 4G
    RAM as pre-fetchable mem resource.

    z85230: spinlock logic
    
    At some point someone added a spin_lock(&dev->lock) to the IRQ handler for
    the Z85230 driver.  This actually correctly fixes a bug but the necessary
    changes to remove the chan->lock calls in the event handlers were not made
    (c->lock is the same lock).
    
    Simona Dascenzo reported the problem with the driver and this patch should
    fix the problem he found.

    usb-storage: use first bulk endpoints, not last
    
    According to the Bulk-Only spec, usb-storage is supposed to use the
    _first_ bulk-in and bulk-out endpoints it finds, not the _last_.  And
    while we're at it, we ought to test the direction of the interrupt
    endpoint as well.  This patch (as842) makes both changes.

    EHCI: fix interrupt-driven remote wakeup
    
    Now that port status change notifications are interrupt-driven,
    ehci-hcd needs to tell usbcore when a remote-wakeup resume operation
    is finished -- we can no longer rely on the core to poll and find
    out.  This patch (as843) uses the root-hub status timer to force a
    poll after the resume is complete.
    
    The patch also changes the test for detecting when the TDRSMDN resume
    period has expired.  It's necessary to use time_after_eq() instead of
    time_after(), since the polling is triggered precisely by a timer.
    The same change is made for TDRSTR reset expiration, for consistency.

    USB: switch ehci-hcd to new polling scheme
    
    Switch ehci-hcd to use the new polling scheme, which reports root

    USB: gadgetfs AIO tweaks
    
    This patch (as837) fixes several mistakes in the AIO interface of the
    gadgetfs driver:
    
    	The ki_retry method is not supposed to do a put on the kiocb.
    	The extra call to aio_put_req() causes memory corruption.
    	(Note: This call was removed before, by patch as691, and then
    	mysteriously re-introduced later.)
    
    	Even if a read transfer is cancelled, we can and should send
    	to the user all the data that did manage to get transferred.
    
    	Testing for AIO cancellation in the I/O completion handler
    	is both racy and (now) unnecessary.  aio_complete() does its
    	own checking, in a safe manner.

    fix for bugzilla #7544 (keyspan USB-to-serial converter)
    
    At least the Keyspan USA-19HS USB-to-serial converter supports
    two different configurations, one where the input endpoints
    have interrupt transfer type and one where they are bulk endpoints.
    The default UHCI configuration uses the interrupt input endpoints.
    The keyspan driver, OTOH, assumes that the device has only bulk
    endpoints (all URBs are initialized by calling usb_fill_bulk_urb
    in keyspan.c/ keyspan_setup_urb). This causes the interval field
    of the input URBs to have a value of zero instead of one, which
    'accidentally' worked with Linux at least up to 2.6.17.11 but
    stopped to with 2.6.18, which changed the UHCI support code handling
    URBs for interrupt endpoints. The patch below modifies to driver to
    initialize its input URBs either as interrupt or as bulk URBs,
    depending on the transfertype contained in the associated endpoint
    descriptor (only tested with the default configuration) enabling
    the driver to again receive data from the serial converter.
    
    Greg K-H reworked the patch.

    EHCI: force high-speed devices to run at full speed
    
    This patch (as710) adds a sysfs class-device attribute file named
    "companion" for EHCI controllers.  The file contains a list of port
    numbers that are dedicated to the companion controller; by writing a
    port number to the file the user can force a high-speed device
    attached directly to the computer to run at full speed.  (As far as I
    know it is not possible to do this for a device attached to an
    external hub.)  A port is removed from the file by writing the
    negative of its port number.
    
    Several users have asked for this facility and it seems like a useful
    thing to have.  Every now and then one runs across a device which
    behaves much better at full speed than at high speed.

    usb: gadgetfs remove delayed init mode
    
    Gadgetfs had a mode in which endpoint descriptors were written by the user
    program before connection.  This mode had some bugs, and hasn't seen much
    (if any) use.  This patch removes that mode, leaving the mode of operation
    where the user program waits for endpoint 0 to report a SET_CONFIGURATION,
    and only then configures the endpoints.

    This patch (as835) removes from usb-storage the code which sets all
    devices to a SCSI level of at least SCSI-2.  The original reasons for

    The patch also marks CB and CBI devices that are SCSI-0 (legacy SCSI)
    as being single-LUN, since the combined SCSI-over-USB transport

    USB: add binary API to usbmon
    
    This patch adds a new, "binary" API in addition to the old, text API usbmon
    had before. The new API allows for less CPU use, and it allows to capture
    all data from a packet where old API only captured 32 bytes at most. There
    are some limitations and conditions to this, e.g. in case someone constructs
    a URB with 1GB of data, it's not likely to be captured, because even the
    huge buffers of the new reader are finite. Nonetheless, I expect this new
    capability to capture all data for all real life scenarios.
    
    The downside is, a special user mode application is required where cat(1)
    worked before. I have sample code at http://people.redhat.com/zaitcev/linux/
    and Paolo Abeni is working on patching libpcap.
    
    This patch was initially written by Paolo and later I tweaked it, and
    we had a little back-and-forth. So this is a jointly authored patch, but
    I am submitting this I am responsible for the bugs.

    rndis_host learns ActiveSync basics
    
    Windows Mobile 5 based devices described as supporting "ActiveSync":
    
     - Speak RNDIS but lack the CDC and union descriptors.  This patch
       updates the cdc ethernet code to fake ACM descriptors we need.
    
     - Require RNDIS_MSG_QUERY messages to include a buffer of the size the
       response should generate.  This patch updates the rndis host code to
       pass this will-be-ignored data.
    
    The resulting RNDIS host code has been reported to work with several
    WM5 based devices.
    
    (Note that a fancier patch is available at synce.sf.net.)
    
    
    Some bugfixes, affecting not just ActiveSync:
        (a)	when cleaning up after RNDS init fails, scrub the second interface
    	just like cdc_ether does, so disconnect won't oops.
        (b)	handle peripherals that use the pad-to-end-of-packet option; some
    	devices can't talk to us if that option doesn't work.
        (c)	when choosing configurations, don't forget about an RNDIS config
    	just because the RNDIS driver is dynamically linked.
    
    Cleanup, streamlining, bugfixes, Kconfig, and matching hub driver update.
    Also for paranoia's sake, refuse to talk to something that looks like a
    real modem instead of RNDIS.

    USB: ethernet gadget interop with MCCI Windows driver
    
    It turns out that minor tweaks to the "CDC Subset" support in the Ethernet
    gadget driver, just updating a config descriptor, let it be automagically
    recognized by a Windows driver supported by MCCI.
    
    This patch adds those descriptors, so systems using PXA 255 processors
    (like Gumstix etc) can interop with those commercial MS-Windows drivers.
    This is a Good Thing since Microsoft's RNDIS code has bugginess issues,
    which are unfortunately compounded by "won't fix" issues as well as "the
    published specs are incomplete and wrong" issues.  Being able to talk to
    the MCCI driver gives Windows users another connectivity option.  (MCCI
    also has CDC Ethernet drivers, which can help most non-PXA processors.)

    This patch applies David Brownell's suggestion for reworking the
    OHCI quirk mechanism via a table of PCI IDs. It adapts the existing
    quirks to use that mechanism.
    
    This also moves the quirks to reset() as suggested by the comment
    in there. This is necessary as we need to have the endian properly
    set before we try to init the controller.

    [PATCH] bcm43xx: Enable fwpostfix in nondebug bcm43xx
    
    The in-kernel bcm43xx driver only works with V3 firmware, whereas the
    experimental version that incorporates the d80211 stack requires V4
    firmware. In bcm43xx-d80211, the fwpostfix module parameter is used
    to differentiate between the versions. In bcm43xx-softmac, this
    module parameter is only enabled when debugging is on. This patch
    makes the module parameter available unconditionaly, and should
    ease the future transition from softmac to d80211.

    assignment may occur. This patch ensures that the various DMA addresses

    configfs: Zero terminate data in configfs attribute writes.
    
    Attributes in configfs are text files.  As such, most handlers expect to be
    able to call functions like simple_strtoul() without checking the bounds
    of the buffer.  Change the call to zero terminate the buffer before calling
    the client's ->store() method.  This does reduce the attribute size from
    PAGE_SIZE to PAGE_SIZE-1.
    
    Also, change get_zeroed_page() to alloc_page(), as we are handling the
    termination.

    [PATCH] ocfs2 heartbeat: clean up bio submission code
    
    As was already pointed out Mathieu Avila on Thu, 07 Sep 2006 03:15:25 -0700
    that OCFS2 is expecting bio_add_page() to add pages to BIOs in an easily
    predictable manner.
    
    That is not true, especially for devices with own merge_bvec_fn().
    
    Therefore OCFS2's heartbeat code is very likely to fail on such devices.
    
    Move the bio_put() call into the bio's bi_end_io() function. This makes the
    whole idea of trying to predict the behaviour of bio_add_page() unnecessary.
    Removed compute_max_sectors() and o2hb_compute_request_limits().

    ocfs2: introduce sc->sc_send_lock to protect outbound outbound messages
    
    When there is a lot of multithreaded I/O usage, two threads can collide
    while sending out a message to the other nodes. This is due to the lack of
    locking between threads while sending out the messages.
    
    When a connected TCP send(), sendto(), or sendmsg() arrives in the Linux
    kernel, it eventually comes through tcp_sendmsg(). tcp_sendmsg() protects
    itself by acquiring a lock at invocation by calling lock_sock().
    tcp_sendmsg() then loops over the buffers in the iovec, allocating
    associated sk_buff's and cache pages for use in the actual send. As it does
    so, it pushes the data out to tcp for actual transmission. However, if one
    of those allocation fails (because a large number of large sends is being
    processed, for example), it must wait for memory to become available. It
    does so by jumping to wait_for_sndbuf or wait_for_memory, both of which
    eventually cause a call to sk_stream_wait_memory(). sk_stream_wait_memory()
    contains a code path that calls sk_wait_event(). Finally, sk_wait_event()
    contains the call to release_sock().
    
    The following patch adds a lock to the socket container in order to
    properly serialize outbound requests.

    ocfs2_dlm: disallow a domain join if node maps mismatch
    
    There is a small window where a joining node may not see the node(s) that
    just died but are still part of the domain. To fix this, we must disallow
    join requests if the joining node has a different node map.
    
    A new field node_map is added to dlm_query_join_request to send the current
    nodes nodemap along with join request. On the receiving end the nodes that
    are part of the cluster verifies if this new node sees all the nodes that
    are still part of the cluster. They disallow the join if the maps mismatch.

    ocfs2_dlm: Ensure correct ordering of set/clear refmap bit on lockres
    
    Eventhough the set refmap bit message is sent before the clear refmap
    message, currently there is no guarentee that the set message will be
    handled before the clear. This patch prevents the clear refmap to be
    processed while the node is sending assert master messages to other
    nodes. (The set refmap message is sent as a response to the assert
    master request).

    ocfs2_dlm: Cookies in locks not being printed correctly in error messages
    
    The dlm encodes the node number and a sequence number in the lock cookie.
    It also stores the cookie in the lockres in the big endian format to avoid
    swapping 8 bytes on each lock request. The bug here was that it was assuming
    the cookie to be in the cpu format when decoding it for printing the error
    message. This patch swaps the bytes before the print.

    sysfs: Shadow directory support
    
    The problem.  When implementing a network namespace I need to be able
    to have multiple network devices with the same name.  Currently this
    is a problem for /sys/class/net/*.
    
    What I want is a separate /sys/class/net directory in sysfs for each
    network namespace, and I want to name each of them /sys/class/net.
    
    I looked and the VFS actually allows that.  All that is needed is
    for /sys/class/net to implement a follow link method to redirect
    lookups to the real directory you want.
    
    Implementing a follow link method that is sensitive to the current
    network namespace turns out to be 3 lines of code so it looks like a
    clean approach.  Modifying sysfs so it doesn't get in my was is a bit
    trickier.
    
    I am calling the concept of multiple directories all at the same path
    in the filesystem shadow directories.  With the directory entry really
    at that location the shadow master.
    
    The following patch modifies sysfs so it can handle a directory
    structure slightly different from the kobject tree so I can implement
    the shadow directories for handling /sys/class/net/.

    This corresponds to the low level objects:

    Driver core: fix race in sysfs between sysfs_remove_file() and read()/write()
    
    This patch prevents a race between IO and removing a file from sysfs.
    It introduces a list of sysfs_buffers associated with a file at the inode.
    Upon removal of a file the list is walked and the buffers marked orphaned.
    IO to orphaned buffers fails with -ENODEV. The driver can safely free
    associated data structures or be unloaded.

    ACPI support for IDE devices
    
    This patch implements ACPI integration for generic IDE devices.
    The ACPI spec mandates that some methods are called during suspend and
    resume. And consequently there most modern Laptops cannot resume
    properly without it.
    
    According to the spec, we should call '_GTM' (Get Timing) upon suspend
    to store the current IDE adapter settings.
    Upon resume we should call '_STM' (Set Timing) to initialize the
    adapter with the stored settings; afterwards '_GTF' (Get Taskfile)
    should be called which returns a buffer with some IDE initialisation
    commands. Those commands should be passed to the drive.
    
    There are two module params which control the behaviour of this patch:
    
    'ide=noacpi'
    	Do not call any ACPI methods (Disables any ACPI method calls)
    'ide=acpigtf'
    	Enable execution of _GTF methods upon resume.
    	Has no effect if 'ide=noacpi' is set.
    'ide=acpionboot'
    	Enable execution of ACPI methods during boot.
    	This might be required on some machines if 'ide=acpigtf' is
    	selected as some machines modify the _GTF information
    	depending on the drive identification passed down with _STM.

    Bart, here's a driver I've been keeping out-of-tree for the past couple
    of years.  This is for the Delking/Lexar/ASKA/etc.. 32-bit cardbus IDE
    CompactFlash adapter card.
    
    It's probably way out of sync with the latest driver model (??), but it
    still builds/works.  I'm not interested in doing much of a rewrite, other
    than for libata someday, as I no longer use the card myself.
    
    But lots of other people do seem to use it, so it might be nice to see it
    "in-tree".

      - in it8213_tuneproc() the highest possible PIO mode is PIO4 (not PIO5)
      - clear ATAPI/IORDY/TIME bits before setting them also for slave device
      - use ->speedproc in it8213_config_drive_for_dma()
      - don't try to tune PIO in config_chipset_for_pio()
      - simplify is_slave calculation in it8213_tuneproc()
      - misc cleanups
    * fix it8213_ratemask() and it8213_tuneproc() comments

    ide: add Toshiba TC86C001 IDE driver (take 2)
    
    This is the driver for the Toshiba TC86C001 GOKU-S PCI IDE controller,
    completely reworked from the original brain-damaged Toshiba's 2.4 version.
    
    This single channel UltraDMA/66 controller is very simple in programming,
    yet Toshiba managed to plant many interesting bugs in it.  The particularly
    nasty "limitation 5" (as they call the errata) caused me to abuse the IDE
    core in a possibly most interesting way so far.  However, this is still
    better than the #ifdef mess in drivers/ide/ide-io.c that the original
    version included (well, it had much more mess)...

    - check for non-NULL drive->id in the ide_dma_check() handler -- this is assumed
      to be true by all other handlers (also, get rid of unnecessary nesting of the
      conditional statements there);

    slc90e66: carry over fixes from piix driver
    
    Synchronize with version 0.46 of the Intel PIIX/ICH driver:
    
    - carry over Alan's and my own fixes in the tuneproc() method and my cleanups
      both there and in the ratemask() method;
    
    - SLC90E66 only supports MW DMA modes 1/2 and SW DMA mode 2 (just like Intel
      chips), so don't claim support for other MW/SW DMA modes;
    
    - don't check dor non-NULL drive->id in the ide_dma_check() method -- this is
      assumed to be true in all other drivers;
    
    - do some coding/formatting cleanups while at it...

    piix: tuneproc() fixes/cleanups
    
    Fix/cleanup the driver's tuneproc() and ratemask() methods:
    
    - PPE, IE, and TIME bits need to be cleared beforehand for the slave drive as
      well as master (Alan probably just forgot about it);
    
    - this driver only supports PIO modes up to 4, so must pass the correct limit
      to ide_get_best_pio_mode();
    
    - use min_t() macro instead of min();
    
    - simplify slave vs master drive evaluation;
    
    - do come coding and formatting cleanups...

    piix: fix 82371MX enablebits
    
    According to the datasheet, Intel 82371MX (MPIIX) actually has only a
    single IDE channel mapped to the primary or secondary ports depending on
    the value of the bit 14 of the IDETIM register at PCI config.  offset 0x6C
    (the register at 0x6F which the driver refers to.  doesn't exist).  So,
    disguise the controller as dual channel and set enablebits masks/values
    such that only either primary or secondary channel is detected enabled.
    Also, preclude the IDE probing code from reading PCI BARs, this controller
    just doesn't have them (it's not the separate PCI function like the other
    PCI controllers), it only decodes the legacy addresses.
    
    [ Alan sayeth " MPIIX does not work with or without the change.  It needs its
      own different driver and not to use setup-pci.  Huge job and since it works
      well with libata who cares.  Ditto the early PIIX chip." ]

    hpt366: HPT36x PCI clock detection fix
    
    Fix minor coding mistake in the HPT36x PCI clock detection code noticed by
    Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz -- it always reported 33 MHz due to the missing
    'break' statements.  This, however, most probably never mattered -- in fact, I
    was thinking of removing the 25/40 MHz cases completely since HPT36x BIOSes
    didn't seem to set any other value than 7 into the 'cmd_high_time' field, i.e.
     supported only 33 MHz PCI.
    
    Note that in the original driver there was another bug: 25 and 40 MHz cases
    were interchanged.  Since the 'cmd_high_time' field is in units of PCI clocks,
    a lower clock count just *cannot* correspond to a higher frequency, i.  e.  it
    should be 5 for 25 MHz PCI and 9 for 40 MHz PCI, not the other way around.

    hpt366: init code rewrite
    
    Finally, rework the driver init.  code to correctly handle all the chip
    variants HighPoint has created so far.  This should cure the rest of the
    timing issues in the driver (especially, on 66 MHz PCI) caused by the
    HighPoint's habit of switching the base DPLL clock with every new revision
    of the chips...
    
      - switch to using the enumeration type to differ between the numerous chip
        variants, matching PCI device/revision ID with the chip type early, at the
        init_setup stage;
    
      - extend the hpt_info structure to hold the DPLL and PCI clock frequencies,
        stop duplicating it for each channel by storing the pointer in the pci_dev
        structure: first, at the init_setup stage, point it to a static "template"
        with only the chip type and its specific base DPLL frequency, the highest
        supported DMA mode, and the chip settings table pointer filled, then, at
        the init_chipset stage, allocate per-chip instance  and fill it with the
        rest of the necessary information;
    
      - get rid of the constant thresholds in the HPT37x PCI clock detection code,
        switch  to calculating  PCI clock frequency based on the chip's base DPLL
        frequency;
    
      - switch to using the DPLL clock and enable UltraATA/133 mode by default on
        anything newer than HPT370/A;
    
      - fold PCI clock detection and DPLL setup code into init_chipset_hpt366(),
        unify the HPT36x/37x setup code and the speedproc handlers by joining the
        register setting lists into the table indexed by the clock selected;
    
      - add enablebits for all the chips to avoid touching disabled channels
        (though the HighPoint BIOS seem to only disable the primary one on
        HPT371/N);
    
      - separate the UltraDMA and MWDMA masks there to avoid changing PIO timings
        when setting an UltraDMA mode in hpt37x_tune_chipset().
    
    This version has been tested on HPT370/302/371N.
    
    Thanks to Alan for the inspiration. Hopefully, his libata driver will also
    benefit from the work done on this "obsolete" driver...

    hpt366: clean up DMA timeout handling for HPT370
    
    Clean up DMA timeout handling for HPT370:
    
    - hpt370_lostirq_timeout() cleared the DMA status which made __ide_dma_end()
       called afterwards return the incorrect result, and the DMA engine was reset
       both before and after stopping DMA while the HighPoint drivers only do it
       after (which seems logical) -- fix this and also rename the function;
    
    - get rid of the needless mutual recursion in hpt370_ide_dma_end() and
       hpt370_ide_dma_timeout();
    
    - get rid of hpt370_lostirq_timeout() since hwif->ide_dma_end() called from
       the driver's interrupt handler later does all its work.

        into one;
    
    - get rid of in init_hpt366 which solely consists of the duplicate code, then
        fold init_hpt37x() into init_chipset_hpt366();
    
    - fix hpt3xx_tune_drive() to always set the PIO mode requested, not the best
        possible one, change hpt366_config_drive_xfer_rate() accordingly, simplify
        it a bit;
    
    - group all the DMA related code together init_hwif_hpt366(), and generally
        clean up and beautify it.

    hpt366: rework rate filtering
    
    - Rework hpt3xx_ratemask() and hpt3xx_ratefilter() so that the former
      returns the max.  mode computed at the load time and doesn't have to do
      bad Ultra33 drive list lookups anymore; remove the duplicate code from
      the latter function.  Move the quirky drive list lookup into
      hpt3xx_quirkproc() where it should have been from the start...
    
    - Disable UltraATA/100 for HPT370 by default as the 33 MHz ATA clock
      being used does not allow for it, and this *greatly* increases the
      transfer speed.
    
    - Save some space by using byte-wide fields in struct hpt_info; switch to
      reading the 8-bit PCI revision ID reg.  only, not the whole 32-bit reg.
    
    - Start incrementing the driver version number with each patch (should
      have been done from the first one posted).

    [POWERPC] Fixup error handling when emulating a floating point instruction
    
    When we do full FP emulation its possible that we need to post a SIGFPE based
    on the results of the emulation.  The previous code ignored this case completely.
    
    Additionally, the Soft_emulate_8xx case had two issues.  One, we should never
    generate a SIGFPE since the code only does data movement.  Second, we were
    interpreting the return codes incorrectly, it returns 0 on success, 1 on
    illop and -EFAULT on a data access error.

    [POWERPC] Enable interrupts if we are doing fp math emulation
    
    Anytime we are emulating an instruction we are going to be doing some form of
    get_user() to get the instruction image to decode.  Since get_user() might
    sleep we need to ensure we have interrupts enabled or we might see something
    like:
    
    Debug: sleeping function called from invalid context at arch/powerpc/kernel/traps.c:697
    in_atomic():0, irqs_disabled():1
    Call Trace:

    However, we want to ensure that interrupts are disabled when handling a trap
    exception that might be used for a kernel breakpoint.  This is why ProgramCheck
    is marked as EXC_XFER_STD instead of EXC_XFER_EE.

    hypervisor call.  This uses it in pSeries_lpar_hpte_invalidate so we
    can tear down mappings with fewer hypervisor calls.

    [POWERPC] Clear RI bit in MSR before restoring r13 when returning to userspace
    
    Some instruction tracing tools use the RI (recoverable interrupt) bit
    in the MSR to indicate when it's safe to single-step.  Currently we
    clear RI after restoring r13 when returning to userspace.  However,
    if we single-step past the point where r13 is restored, we'll corrupt
    r13 in the exception entry code and not restore it.  This moves the
    clearing of RI to just before r13 is restored so this doesn't happen.

    [POWERPC] Fix performance monitor exception
    
    To the issue: some point during 2.6.20 development, Paul Mackerras
    introduced the "lazy IRQ  disabling" patch (very cool work,  BTW).
    In that patch, the performance monitor unit exception was marked as
    "maskable", in the sense that if interrupts were soft-disabled, that
    exception could be ignored.  This broke my PowerPC profiling code.
    The symptom that I see is that a varying number of interrupts
    (from 0 to $n$, typically closer to 0) get delivered, when, in
    reality, it should always be very close to $n$.
    
    The issue stems from the way masking is being done.   Masking in
    this fashion seems to  work well with the decrementer and external
    interrupts, because they are raised again until "really"  handled.
    For the PMU, however, this does not apply (at least on my Xserver
    machine with a 970FX processor).  If the PMU exception is not handled,
    it will _not_ be re-raised (at least on my machine).  The documentation
    states that the PMXE bit in MMCR0 is set to 0 when the PMU exception
    is raised.  However, software must re-set the bit to re-enable PMU
    exceptions.  If the exception is ignored (as currently) not only is
    that interrupt lost, but because software does not re-set PMXE, the
    PMU registers are "frozen" forever.
    
    [This patch means that performance monitor exceptions are taken and
    handled even if irqs are off, as long as some other interrupt hasn't
    come along and caused interrupts to be hard-disabled.  In this sense
    the PMU exception becomes like an NMI.  The oprofile code for most
    powerpc processors does nothing that is unsafe in an NMI context, but
    the Cell oprofile code does a spin_lock_irqsave.  However, that turns
    out to be OK because Cell doesn't actually use the performance
    monitor exception; performance monitor interrupts come in as a
    regular interrupt on Cell, so will be disabled when irqs are off.

    [POWERPC] pasemi: Configure DMA controller interrupts
    
    The DMA controller on PWRficient is somewhat special -- has a PCI header
    so it looks like it's on the root PCI (-Express) root bus, but it uses
    more than the default number of interrupts (and they are hardwired).
    
    We need to wire up all interrupts for the DMA controller. The generic
    IRQ code will only map the primary interrupt from the PCI header (128),
    so add 129->211 by hand.

    [POWERPC] MPIC: support more than 256 sources
    
    Allow more than the default 256 MPIC sources. Allocates a new flag
    (MPIC_LARGE_VECTORS) to be used by platform code when instantiating
    the mpic.
    
    I picked 11 bits worth right now since it would cover the number of

    [POWERPC] Fix array indexing error in rheap grow()
    
    The grow() function in the rheap library allocates a larger array of blocks,
    copies the contents of the old blocks array to the newly allocated array and
    fixes the list_head pointers after the copy.  At the end, the new blocks must
    be enqueued to the empty_list of the rh_info_t structure.  This patch fixes
    a bug where the code was indexing past the end of the array when enqueueing
    blocks.  The UCC ethernet driver, which uses the rheap allocator, experiences
    kernel panics because of this bug.

    [POWERPC] pSeries: EEH improperly enabled for some Power4 systems
    
    It appears that EEH is improperly enabled for some Power4 systems.
    On these systems, the ibm,set-eeh-option returns a value of success
    even when EEH is not supported on the given node. Thus, an explicit
    check for support is required.
    
    During boot, on power4, without this patch, one sees messages
    similar to:
    
    EEH: event on unsupported device, rc=0 dn=/pci@400000000110/IBM,sp@1
    EEH: event on unsupported device, rc=0 dn=/pci@400000000110/pci@2
    EEH: event on unsupported device, rc=0 dn=/pci@400000000110/pci@2,2
    etc.
    
    The patch makes these go away.
    
    Without this patch, EEH recovery does seem to work correctly for
    at least some devices (I tested ethernet e1000), but fails to
    recover others (the Emulex LightPulse LPFC, most notably).
    Off the top of my head, I don't remember why some devices are
    affected, but not others.
    
    The PAPR indicates that the correct way to test for EEH is as
    done in this patch; its not clear to me if this was in the PAPR
    all along, or recently added; if it was there all along, its not
    clear to me why this hadn't been fixed long ago. I suspect only
    certain firmware levels are affected.

    [MTD] OneNAND: Subpage write returned incorrect length written
    
    When a write is done, the length written is returned.  When a
    single subpage is written the length returned should be the
    subpage size, however the page size was being returned.

    [PATCH] Keys: Fix key serial number collision handling
    
    Fix the key serial number collision avoidance code in key_alloc_serial().
    
    This didn't use to be so much of a problem as the key serial numbers were
    allocated from a simple incremental counter, and it would have to go through
    two billion keys before it could possibly encounter a collision.  However, now
    that random numbers are used instead, collisions are much more likely.
    
    This is fixed by finding a hole in the rbtree where the next unused serial
    number ought to be and using that by going almost back to the top of the
    insertion routine and redoing the insertion with the new serial number rather
    than trying to be clever and attempting to work out the insertion point
    pointer directly.
    
    This fixes kernel BZ #7727.

     Definition of `space' was removed, scripts/Kbuild.include has one.
     That definition was taken right from the GNU make manual, while Kbuild's

    [CRYPTO] all: Check for usage in hard IRQ context
    
    Using blkcipher/hash crypto operations in hard IRQ context can lead
    to random memory corruption due to the reuse of kmap_atomic slots.
    Since crypto operations were never meant to be used in hard IRQ
    contexts, this patch checks for such usage and returns an error
    before kmap_atomic is performed.

    [MIPS] Alchemy:  Fix PCI-memory access
    
    The problem was introduced in 2.6.18.3 with the casting of some
    36bit-defines (PCI memory) in au1000.h to resource_size_t which may be
    u32 or u64 depending on the experimental CONFIG_RESOURCES_64BIT.
    
    With unset CONFIG_RESOURCES_64BIT, the pci-memory cannot be accessed
    because the ioremap in arch/mips/au1000/common/pci.c already used the
    truncated addresses.
    With set CONFIG_RESOURCES_64BIT, things get even worse, because PCI-scan
    aborts, due to resource conflict: request_resource() in arch/mips/pci/pci.c
    fails because the maximum iomem-address is 0xffffffff (32bit) but the
    pci-memory-start-address is 0x440000000 (36bit).
    
    To get pci working again, I propose the following patch:
    
    1. remove the resource_size_t-casting from au1000.h again
    2. make the casting in arch/mips/au1000/common/pci.c (it's allowed and
    necessary here. The 36bit-handling will be done in __fixup_bigphys_addr).
    
    With this patch pci works again like in 2.6.18.2, the gcc-compile warnings
    in pci.c are gone and it doesn't depend on CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL.

    [MIPS] FLATMEM: introduce PHYS_OFFSET.

    means that platforms having a big hole at their memory start
    paid the price of wasting some memory for the allocation of
    unused entries in mem_map[].
    
    This patch prevents this waste.
    
    It introduces PHYS_OFFSET define which is the start of the
    physical memory and uses it wherever needed. Specially when
    converting physical/virtual addresses into virtual/physical
    ones.
    
    Currently all platforms defines PHYS_OFFSET to 0.

    [MIPS] Define MIPS_CPU_IRQ_BASE in generic header
    
    The irq_base for {mips,rm7k,rm9k}_cpu_irq_init() are constant on all
    platforms and are same value on most platforms (0 or 16, depends on
    CONFIG_I8259).  Define them in asm-mips/mach-generic/irq.h and make
    them customizable.  This will save a few cycle on each CPU interrupt.
    
    A good side effect is removing some dependencies to MALTA in generic
    SMTC code.
    
    Although MIPS_CPU_IRQ_BASE is customizable, this patch changes irq
    mappings on DDB5477, EMMA2RH and MIPS_SIM, since really customizing
    them might cause some header dependency problem and there seems no
    good reason to customize it.  So currently only VR41XX is using custom
    MIPS_CPU_IRQ_BASE value, which is 0 regardless of CONFIG_I8259.
    
    Testing this patch on those platforms is greatly appreciated.  Thank
    you.

    [ARM] Move processor_modes[] to .../process.c
    
    bad_mode() currently prints the mode which caused the exception, and
    then causes an oops dump to be printed which again displays this
    information (since the CPSR in the struct pt_regs is correct.)  This
    leads to processor_modes[] being shared between traps.c and process.c
    with a local declaration of it.
    
    We can clean this up by moving processor_modes[] to process.c and
    removing the duplication, resulting in processor_modes[] becoming
    static.

    [ARM] Improve csum_fold, cleanup csum_tcpudp_magic()

    it can simply add the high and low parts together by rotating by 16

    Also, since csum_tcpudp_magic() is just csum_tcpudp_nofold + csum_fold,
    use those two functions to achieve this.  Also note that there is a
    csum_fold() at the end of ip_fast_csum() as well, so use the real

    [GFS2] nfsd readdirplus assertion failure
    
    Glock assertion failure found in '07 NFS connectathon. One of the NFSDs
    is doing a "readdirplus" procedure call. It passes the logic into
    gfs2_readdir() where it obtains its directory inode glock. This is then
    followed by filehandle construction that invokes lookup code. It hits
    the assertion failure while trying to obtain the inode glock again
    inside gfs2_drevalidate().
    
    This patch bypasses the recursive glock call if caller already holds the

    [IA64] register memory ranges in a consistent manner
    
    While pursuing and unrelated issue with 64Mb granules I noticed a problem
    related to inconsistent use of add_active_range.  There doesn't appear any
    reason to me why FLATMEM versus DISCONTIG_MEM should register memory to
    add_active_range with different code.  So I've changed the code into a
    common implementation.
    
    The other subtle issue fixed by this patch was calling add_active_range in
    count_node_pages before granule aligning is performed.  We were lucky with
    16MB granules but not so with 64MB granules.  count_node_pages has reserved
    regions filtered out and as a consequence linked kernel text and data
    aren't covered by calls to count_node_pages.  So linked kernel regions
    wasn't reported to add_active_regions.  This resulted in free_initmem
    causing numerous bad_page reports.  This won't occur with this patch
    because now all known memory regions are reported by
    register_active_ranges.

    [IA64] Clear IRQ affinity when unregistered
    
    When we offline a CPU, migrate_irqs() tries to determine whether the
    affinity bits of the IRQ descriptor match any of the remaining online
    CPUs.  If not, it fixes up the interrupt to point somewhere else.
    Unfortunately, if an IRQ is unregistered the IRQ descriptor may still
    have affinity to the CPU being offlined, but the no_irq_chip handler
    doesn't provide a set_affinity function.  This causes us to hit the
    WARN_ON in migrate_irqs().
    
    The easiest solution seems to be setting all the bits in the affinity
    mask when the last interrupt is removed from the vector.  I hit this on
    an older kernel with Xen/ia64 using driver domains (so it probably needs
    more testing on upstream).  Xen essentially uses the bind/unbind
    interface in sysfs to unregister a device from a driver and thus
    unregister the interrupt.

    ia64_kimage is NULL.  machine_kdump_on_init() passes ia64_kimage() to
    machine_kexec() which assumes a valid value.

    If alloc_etherdev() failed, then sky2_init_netdev will return NULL,

    sky2: software rx/tx stats
    
    Maintain packet statistics in software rather than hardware.
    This is slightly slower, but allows easier debugging of problems
    where packets are still being received by PHY but not being handled
    by hardware.

    bonding: modify sysfs support to permit multiple loads
    
    	The existing code would blindly attempt to create the
    bonding_masters file (in /sys/class/net) every time the module was
    loaded.  When the module is loaded multiple times (which is the
    historical method used by initscripts and sysconfig to create multiple
    bonding interfaces), this caused load failure of the second module load
    attempt, as the creation request would fail.
    
    	This changes the code to note the failure, arrange to not remove
    the bonding_masters file upon module exit, and then return success.
    
    	Bonding interfaces created by the second or subsequent loads of
    the module will not exist in bonding_masters.  This is not a significant
    change, as previously only the interfaces from the most recent load of
    the module would be listed.  Both situations are less than optimal, but
    this case permits compatibility with existing distro configuration
    scripts, and is consistent.
    
    	Note that previously, the sysfs create request would overwrite
    the exsting bonding_masters file and succeed, allowing multiple loads of
    the module.  The sysfs code has recently changed to return an error if
    the file being created already exists.
    
    	Patrick McHardy <kaber@trash.net>, who reported this problem,
    observed crashes on the old kernel (before sysfs checked for
    duplicates).  I did not experience such crashes, but this change should
    resolve them.

    driver for Silan SC92031 netdev
    
    This is a driver for the Silan SC92031/Rsltek 8139D NIC chip.
    
    This chip is found on at least one counterfeit Encore ENL832-TX-RENT NIC
    [1], which came with a mini-CD with the 2.4 driver.  A slightly older
    version of the driver was found at [2].  The main difference between them
    is that the newer one has a small bugfix in the RX path, a lot of
    gratuitous renaming of functions, all the printable strings changed to show
    as a "Rsltek 8139D" [sic], and a PCI ID of 8139 instead of 2031.  The
    driver on this patch is a rewrite of the vendor drivers (based mostly on
    the older one).
    
    Changes from the previous patch sent to netdev:
    - Use MMIO instead of PIO
    - Changed TX bounce buffers allocation
    - Use skb_copy_and_csum_dev
    - Several small bug fixes
    - Tested for more than just a few minutes each time
    
    [1] See http://www.encore-usa.com/faq.php under ENL832-TX-RENT for more
        information
    [2] Look for SL_LINUX.ZIP (which is really a .tar.gz) at
        http://broadbandforum.in/dataone_Intex_LAN_cardlinux-t4207-s15.html
    [3] To compile on 2.6.17, simply add back the last argument to the
        interrupt handler in two places, and copy the boolean declarations
        from 2.6.19

    [PATCH] zd1211rw: Remove addressing abstraction
    
    Instead of passing our own custom 32-bit addresses around and
    translating them, this patch makes all our register address constants
    absolute and removes the translation.
    
    There are two ugly parts:
     - fw_reg_addr() is needed to compute addresses of firmware registers, as this
       is dynamic based upon firmware
     - inc_addr() needs a small hack to handle byte vs word addressing
    
    However, both of those are only small, and we don't use fw_regs a whole
    lot anyway.
    
    The bonuses here include simplicity and improved driver readability. Also, the
    fact that registers are now referenced by 16-bit absolute addresses (as
    opposed to 32-bit pseudo addresses) means that over 2kb compiled code size has
    been shaved off.
    
    Includes some touchups and sparse fixes from Ulrich Kunitz.

    [PATCH] zd1211rw: Consistency for address space constants
    
    The zd1211rw address space has confused me once too many times. This
    patch introduces the following naming notation:
    
    Memory space is split into segments (cr, fw, eeprom) and segments may
    contain components (e.g. boot code inside eeprom). These names are
    arbitrary and only for the description below:
    
    x_START: Absolute address of segment start
    (previously these were named such as CR_BASE_OFFSET, but they weren't
    really offsets unless you were considering them as an offset to 0)
    
    x_LEN: Segment length
    
    x_y_LEN: Length of component y of segment x
    
    x_y_OFFSET: Relative address of component y into segment x. The absolute
    address for this component is (x_START + x_y_OFFSET)
    
    I also renamed EEPROM registers to EEPROM data. These 'registers' can't
    be written to using standard I/O and really represent predefined data
    from the vendor.

    e1000: fix NAPI performance on 4-port adapters
    
    This fix attempts to solve a customer (IBM) reported issue with NAPI
    enabled e1000 having bad performance when transmitting simultaneously
    on four ports.  The issue comes down to an interaction between NAPI,
    hardware interrupt balancing, and the driver rescheduling poll on
    the same processor.  Try to fix by allowing the driver to re-enable
    interrupts sooner instead of polling one more time, when there was
    recently all the work completed in cleanup.

    [IA64] use snprintf() on features field of /proc/cpuinfo
    
    Some patches have turned up on xen-devel recently to convert strcpy()
    to safer alternatives and so forth.  While reviewing those patches
    I noticed that the features string building could be cleaned up.
    
    This patch uses snprintf() instead of strcpy() and direct character
    pointer manipulation.  It makes the features string building safe and
    gets rid of the special case for features output in show_cpuinfo()
    
    Additionally I removed the (int) cast of ARRAY_SIZE, which seems to
    serve no purpose.

    [IA64] enable singlestep on system call
    
    As is pointed out in
    http://www.gelato.org/community/view_linear.php?id=1_1036&from=authors&value=Ian%20Wienand#1_1039,
    if single step on break instruction, the break fault has higher
    priority than the single-step trap. When the break fault handler
    is entered, it advances the IP by 1 instruction so break instruction
    single-stepping is skipped, actually it is next instruction which
    is single stepped.
    
    This patch modifies this, it adds TIF_SINGLESTEP bit for thread
    flags, and generate a fake sigtrap when single stepping break
    instruction. Test case in attachment can verify this. Any comments
    is welcome.

    the TOD clocks of all connected servers in sync. For availability
    two ETR units can be connected to a machine. If the clock deviates
    for more than the sync-check tolerance all cpus get a machine check
    that indicates that the clock is out of sync. For the lovely details
    how to get the clock back in sync see the code below.

    [S390] noexec protection
    
    This provides a noexec protection on s390 hardware. Our hardware does
    not have any bits left in the pte for a hw noexec bit, so this is a
    different approach using shadow page tables and a special addressing
    mode that allows separate address spaces for code and data.
    
    As a special feature of our "secondary-space" addressing mode, separate
    page tables can be specified for the translation of data addresses
    (storage operands) and instruction addresses. The shadow page table is
    used for the instruction addresses and the standard page table for the
    data addresses.
    The shadow page table is linked to the standard page table by a pointer
    in page->lru.next of the struct page corresponding to the page that
    contains the standard page table (since page->private is not really
    private with the pte_lock and the page table pages are not in the LRU
    list).
    Depending on the software bits of a pte, it is either inserted into
    both page tables or just into the standard (data) page table. Pages of
    a vma that does not have the VM_EXEC bit set get mapped only in the
    data address space. Any try to execute code on such a page will cause a
    page translation exception. The standard reaction to this is a SIGSEGV
    with two exceptions: the two system call opcodes 0x0a77 (sys_sigreturn)
    and 0x0aad (sys_rt_sigreturn) are allowed. They are stored by the
    kernel to the signal stack frame. Unfortunately, the signal return
    mechanism cannot be modified to use an SA_RESTORER because the
    exception unwinding code depends on the system call opcode stored
    behind the signal stack frame.
    
    This feature requires that user space is executed in secondary-space
    mode and the kernel in home-space mode, which means that the addressing
    modes need to be switched and that the noexec protection only works
    for user space.
    After switching the addressing modes, we cannot use the mvcp/mvcs
    instructions anymore to copy between kernel and user space. A new
    mvcos instruction has been added to the z9 EC/BC hardware which allows
    to copy between arbitrary address spaces, but on older hardware the
    page tables need to be walked manually.

    [S390] dasd: fix bug in dasd initialization cleanup
    
    The initialization of the dasd_eer code is one of the last steps of the
    dasd driver initialization. When initialization fails in one of the
    earlier steps, the dasd_exit function is called to clean up what has been
    done so far. So the dasd_eer_exit function may be called, although the
    dasd_eer_init function wasn't called before and dasd_eer_exit tries to
    unregister a misc device that wasn't registered, which results in a BUG.
    
    Make sure that dasd_eer_exit can be called without initialization. Use a
    dynamically allocated struct miscdevice instead of a static one, so we
    only try to unregister the device if it exists and was actually registered.

    Change the bounce buffer logic of cpcmd. diag8 needs _real_ memory below
    2GB. Therefore vmalloced data does not work. As the data might cross a
    page boundary, we cannot use virt_to_page either. The solution is to use
    virt_to_page only in the check for a bounce buffer.
    
    There was a redundant check for response==NULL. response < 2GB contains
    this check as well.
    
    I also removed the rlen==0 check, since rlen=0 and response!=NULL would
    be a caller bug and response==NULL is already checked.

    [GFS2] Fix unlink deadlocks
    
    Move the glock acquisition to outside of the transactions.
    
    Lock odering must be preserved in order to prevent ABBA
    deadlocks. The current gfs2_change_nlink code would tries
    to grab the glock after having started a transaction and thus is holding
    the log lock. This is inconsistent with other code paths in
    gfs that grab the resource group glock prior to staring
    a tranactions.
    
    One problem with this fix is that the resource group
    lock is always grabbed now even if the inode still has
    ref count and can not be marked for unlink.

    normal filesystem operation. The write site will only happen during
    umount of the file system.
    
    Also the bug only triggers when using the DLM lock manager and only then

    [DLM] can miss clearing resend flag
    
    A long, complicated sequence of events, beginning with the RESEND flag not
    being cleared on an lkb, can result in an unlock never completing.
    
    - lkb on waiters list for remote lookup
    - the remote node is both the dir node and the master node, so
      it optimizes the lookup into a request and sends a request
      reply back
    - the request reply is saved on the requestqueue to be processed
      after recovery
    - recovery runs dlm_recover_waiters_pre() which sets RESEND flag
      so the lookup will be resent after recovery
    - end of recovery: process_requestqueue takes saved request reply
      which removes the lkb off the waitesr list, _without_ clearing
      the RESEND flag
    - end of recovery: dlm_recover_waiters_post() doesn't do anything
      with the now completed lookup lkb (would usually clear RESEND)
    - later, the node unmounts, unlocks this lkb that still has RESEND
      flag set
    - the lkb is on the waiters list again, now for unlock, when recovery
      occurs, dlm_recover_waiters_pre() shows the lkb for unlock with RESEND
      set, doesn't do anything since the master still exists
    - end of recovery: dlm_recover_waiters_post() takes this lkb off
      the waiters list because it has the RESEND flag set, then reports
      an error because unlocks are never supposed to be handled in
      recover_waiters_post().
    - later, the unlock reply is received, doesn't find the lkb on
      the waiters list because recover_waiters_post() has wrongly
      removed it.
    - the unlock operation has been lost, and we're left with a
      stray granted lock
    - unmount spins waiting for the unlock to complete
    
    The visible evidence of this problem will be a node where gfs umount is
    spinning, the dlm waiters list will be empty, and the dlm locks list will
    show a granted lock.
    
    The fix is simply to clear the RESEND flag when taking an lkb off the
    waiters list.

    [DLM] saved dlm message can be dropped
    
    dlm_receive_message() returns 0 instead of returning 'error'.  What would
    happen is that process_requestqueue would take a saved message off the
    requestqueue and call receive_message on it.  receive_message would then
    see that recovery had been aborted, set error to EINTR, and 'goto out',
    expecting that the error would be returned.  Instead, 0 was always
    returned, so process_requestqueue would think that the message had been
    processed and delete it instead of saving it to process next time.  This
    means the message (usually an unlock in my tests) would be lost.

    [GFS2] use CURRENT_TIME_SEC instead of get_seconds in gfs2
    
    I was looking something else up and came across this...
    
    I don't honestly have a good reason to change it other than to make it
    like every other Linux filesystem in this regard.  ;-)  It doesn't
    functionally change anything, but makes some lines shorter. :)
    
    I'm also curious; why does gfs2 have 64-bits of on-disk timestamps, but
    not in timespec_t format, and only stores second resolutions?  Seems like
    you're halfway to sub-second resolutions already.
    
    I suppose if that gets implemented then all of the below should
    instead be CURRENT_TIME not CURRENT_TIME_SEC.

    [GFS2] Tidy up glops calls
    
    This patch doesn't make any changes to the ordering of the various
    operations related to glocking, but it does tidy up the calls to the
    glops.c functions to make the structure more obvious.
    
    The two functions: gfs2_glock_xmote_th() and gfs2_glock_drop_th() can be
    made static within glock.c since they are called by every set of glock
    operations. The xmote_th and drop_th glock operations are then made
    conditional upon those two routines existing and called from the
    previously mentioned functions in glock.c respectively.
    
    Also it can be seen that the go_sync operation isn't needed since it can
    easily be replaced by calls to xmote_bh and drop_bh respectively. This
    results in no longer (confusingly) calling back into routines in glock.c
    from glops.c and also reducing the glock operations by one member.

    [GFS2] Remove local exclusive glock mode
    
    Here is a patch for GFS2 to remove the local exclusive flag. In
    the places it was used, mutex's are always held earlier in the
    call path, so it appears redundant in the LM_ST_SHARED case.
    
    Also, the GFS2 holders were setting local exclusive in any case where
    the requested lock was LM_ST_EXCLUSIVE. So the other places in the glock
    code where the flag was tested have been replaced with tests for the
    lock state being LM_ST_EXCLUSIVE in order to ensure the logic is the
    same as before (i.e. LM_ST_EXCLUSIVE is always locally exclusive as well
    as globally exclusive).

    [GFS2] Remove the "greedy" function from glock.[ch]
    
    The "greedy" code was an attempt to retain glocks for a minimum length
    of time when they relate to mmap()ed files. The current implementation
    of this feature is not, however, ideal in that it required allocating
    memory in order to do this and its overly complicated.
    
    It also misses the mark by ignoring the other I/O operations which are
    just as likely to suffer from the same problem. So the plan is to remove
    this now and then add the functionality back as part of the glock state
    machine at a later date (and thus take into account all the possible
    users of this feature)

    [GFS2] Shrink gfs2_inode memory by half
    
    Here is something I spotted (while looking for something entirely
    different) the other day.
    
    Rather than using a completion in each and every struct gfs2_holder,
    this removes it in favour of hashed wait queues, thus saving a
    considerable amount of memory both on the stack (where a number of
    gfs2_holder structures are allocated) and in particular in the
    gfs2_inode which has 8 gfs2_holder structures embedded within it.
    
    As a result on x86_64 the gfs2_inode shrinks from 2488 bytes to
    1912 bytes, a saving of 576 bytes per inode (no thats not a typo!).
    In actual practice we get a much better result than that since
    now that a gfs2_inode is under the 2048 byte barrier, we get two
    per 4k slab page effectively halving the amount of memory required
    to store gfs2_inodes.

    [GFS2] Clean up/speed up readdir
    
    This removes the extra filldir callback which gfs2 was using to
    enclose an attempt at readahead for inodes during readdir. The
    code was too complicated and also hurts performance badly in the
    case that the getdents64/readdir call isn't being followed by
    stat() and it wasn't even getting it right all the time when it
    was.
    
    As a result, on my test box an "ls" of a directory containing 250000
    files fell from about 7mins (freshly mounted, so nothing cached) to
    between about 15 to 25 seconds. When the directory content was cached,
    the time taken fell from about 3mins to about 4 or 5 seconds.
    
    Interestingly in the cached case, running "ls -l" once reduced the time
    taken for subsequent runs of "ls" to about 6 secs even without this
    patch. Now it turns out that there was a special case of glocks being
    used for prefetching the metadata, but because of the timeouts for these
    locks (set to 10 secs) the metadata was being timed out before it was
    being used and this the prefetch code was constantly trying to prefetch
    the same data over and over.
    
    Calling "ls -l" meant that the inodes were brought into memory and once
    the inodes are cached, the glocks are not disposed of until the inodes
    are pushed out of the cache, thus extending the lifetime of the glocks,
    and thus bringing down the time for subsequent runs of "ls"
    considerably.

    [GFS2] Add writepages for "data=writeback" mounts
    
    It occurred to me that although a gfs2 specific writepages for ordered
    writes and journaled data would be tricky, by hooking writepages only
    for "data=writeback" mounts we could take advantage of not needing
    buffer heads (we don't use them on the read side, nor have we for some
    time) and create much larger I/Os for the block layer.
    
    Using blktrace both before and after, its possible to see that for large
    I/Os, most of the requests generated through writepages are now 1024
    sectors after this patch is applied as opposed to 8 sectors before.

    [DLM] fix master recovery
    
    If master recovery happens on an rsb in one recovery sequence, then that
    sequence is aborted before lock recovery happens, then in the next
    sequence, we rely on the previous master recovery (which may now be
    invalid due to another node ignoring a lookup result) and go on do to the
    lock recovery where we get stuck due to an invalid master value.
    
     recovery cycle begins: master of rsb X has left
     nodes A and B send node C an rcom lookup for X to find the new master
     C gets lookup from B first, sets B as new master, and sends reply back to B
     C gets lookup from A next, and sends reply back to A saying B is master
     A gets lookup reply from C and sets B as the new master in the rsb
     recovery cycle on A, B and C is aborted to start a new recovery
     B gets lookup reply from C and ignores it since there's a new recovery
     recovery cycle begins: some other node has joined
     B doesn't think it's the master of X so it doesn't rebuild it in the directory
     C looks up the master of X, no one is master, so it becomes new master
     B looks up the master of X, finds it's C
     A believes that B is the master of X, so it sends its lock to B
     B sends an error back to A
     A resends
     this repeats forever, the incorrect master value on A is never corrected
    
    The fix is to do master recovery on an rsb that still has the NEW_MASTER
    flag set from an earlier recovery sequence, and therefore didn't complete
    lock recovery.

    [GFS2] Fix change nlink deadlock
    
    Bugzilla 215088
    
    Fix deadlock in gfs2_change_nlink() while installing RHEL5 into GFS2
    partition. The gfs2_rename() apparently needs block allocation for the
    new name (into the directory) where it requires rg locks. At the same
    time, while updating the nlink count for the replaced file,
    gfs2_change_nlink() tries to return the inode meta-data back to resource
    group where it needs rg locks too. Our logic doesn't allow process to
    acquire these locks recursively by the same process  (RHEL installer)
    that results a BUG call. This only happens within rename code path and
    only if the destination file exists before the rename operation.

    [GFS2] Fail over to readpage for stuffed files
    
    This is partially derrived from a patch written by Russell Cattelan.
    It fixes a bug where there is a race between readpages and truncate
    by ignoring readpages for stuffed files. This is ok because a stuffed
    file will never be more than one block (minus sizeof(struct gfs2_dinode))
    in size and block size is always less than page size, so we do not lose
    anything efficiency-wise by not doing readahead for stuffed files. They
    will have already been "read ahead" by the action of reading the inode
    in, in the first place.
    
    This is the remaining part of the fix for Red Hat bugzilla #218966
    which had not yet made it upstream.

    [GFS2] Fix DIO deadlock
    
    This patch fixes Red Hat bugzilla #212627 in which a deadlock occurs
    due to trying to take the i_mutex while holding a glock. The correct
    locking order is defined as i_mutex -> glock in all cases.
    
    I've left dealing with allocating writes. I know that we need to do
    that, but for now this should do the trick. We don't need to take the
    i_mutex on write, because the VFS has already taken it for us. On read
    we don't need it since the glock is enough protection. The reason that
    I've made some of the checks into a separate function is that we'll need
    to do the checks again in the allocating write case eventually, so this
    is partly in preparation for this. Likewise the return value test of !=
    1 might look a bit odd and thats because we'll need a third return value
    in case of requiring an allocation.
    
    I've made the change to deferred mode on the glock to ensure flushing
    read caches on other nodes. I notice that (using blktrace to look at
    whats going on) we appear to do a better job of large I/Os than ext3
    after this patch (in terms of not splitting up the I/Os).

    [DLM] fix lost flags in stub replies
    
    When the dlm fakes an unlock/cancel reply from a failed node using a stub
    message struct, it wasn't setting the flags in the stub message.  So, in
    the process of receiving the fake message the lkb flags would be updated
    and cleared from the zero flags in the message.  The problem observed in
    tests was the loss of the USER flag which caused the dlm to think a user
    lock was a kernel lock and subsequently fail an assertion checking the
    validity of the ast/callback field.

    LVB's are not sent as part of new requests, but the code receiving the

    where it mistakenly thought the lvb lived actually contained the resource

    [DLM] fix old rcom messages
    
    A reply to a recovery message will often be received after the relevant
    recovery sequence has aborted and the next recovery sequence has begun.
    We need to ignore replies to these old messages from the previous
    recovery.  There's already a way to do this for synchronous recovery
    requests using the rc_id number, but not for async.
    
    Each recovery sequence already has a locally unique sequence number
    associated with it.  This patch adds a field to the rcom (recovery
    message) structure where this recovery sequence number can be placed,
    rc_seq.  When a node sends a reply to a recovery request, it copies the
    rc_seq number it received into rc_seq_reply.  When the first node receives
    the reply to its recovery message, it will check whether rc_seq_reply
    matches the current recovery sequence number, ls_recover_seq, and if not
    then it ignores the old reply.
    
    An old, inadequate approach to filtering out old replies (checking if the
    current stage of recovery has moved back to the start) has been removed
    from two spots.
    
    The protocol version number is changed to reflect the different rcom
    structures.

    [DLM] fix resend rcom lock
    
    There's a chance the new master of resource hasn't learned it's the new
    master before another node sends it a lock during recovery.  The node
    sending the lock needs to resend if this happens.
    
    - A sends a master lookup for resource R to C
    - B sends a master lookup for resource R to C
    - C receives A's lookup, assigns A to be master of R and
      sends a reply back to A
    - C receives B's lookup and sends a reply back to B saying
      that A is the master
    - B receives lookup reply from C and sends its lock for R to A
    - A receives lock from B, doesn't think it's the master of R
      and sends an error back to B
    - A receives lookup reply from C and becomes master of R
    - B gets error back from A and resends its lock back to A
      (this resending is what this patch does)
    - A receives lock from B, it now sees it's the master of R
      and takes the lock

    RDMA/addr: Handle ethernet neighbour updates during route resolution
    
    The iWARP connection manager uses the ib_addr services to do route
    resolution (neighbour discovery in the IP world).  The ib_addr
    netevent callback routine, however, currently only acts on InfiniBand
    neighbour updates.  It needs to act on ethernet neighbour updates as
    well.
    
    This patch just removes filtering on device type altogether and will
    trigger on any neighour updates where the nud_type is valid.  This
    simplifies the code some.

    Make the untyped data region in ib_user_mad have type u64 so that it
    gets aligned properly.  This avoids alignment faults in ib_umad when
    casting the data field to an rmpp_mad and accessing the 64-bit tid

    IB/srp: Don't wait for response when QP is in error state.
    
    When there is a call to send_tsk_mgmt SRP posts a send and waits for 5
    seconds to get a response.
    
    When the QP is in the error state it is obvious that there will be no
    response so it is quite useless to wait.  In fact, the timeout causes
    SRP to wait a long time to reconnect when a QP error occurs. (Each
    abort and each reset_device calls send_tsk_mgmt, which waits for the
    timeout).  The following patch solves this problem by identifying the
    failure and returning an immediate error code.

    IB: Return qp pointer as part of ib_wc
    
    struct ib_wc currently only includes the local QP number: this matches
    the IB spec, but seems mostly useless. The following patch replaces
    this with the pointer to qp itself, and updates all low level drivers
    and all users.
    
    This has the following advantages:
    - Ability to get a per-qp context through wc->qp->qp_context
    - Existing drivers already have the qp pointer ready in poll cq, so
      this change actually saves a tiny bit (extra memory read) on data path
      (for ehca it would actually be expensive to find the QP pointer when
      polling a CQ, but ehca does not support SRQ so we can leave wc->qp as
      NULL for ehca)
    - Users that need the QP number can still get it through wc->qp->qp_num
    
    Use case:
    
    In IPoIB connected mode code, I have a common CQ shared by multiple
    QPs.  To track connection usage, I need a way to get at some per-QP
    context upon the completion, and I would like to avoid allocating
    context object per work request just to stick a QP pointer into it.
    With this code, I can just use wc->qp->qp_context.

    Hardware does not say whether card was inserted or removed when reporting
    socket events. Moreover, during suspend, media can be removed or switched
    to some other card type without notification. Therefore, for each socket
    in the change set the following is performed:
    1. If there's active device in the socket it's unregistered
    2. Media detection is performed
    3. If detection recognizes supportable media, new device is registered
    
    This patch also alters some macros and variable names to enhance clarity.

    tifm_sd: restructure initialization, removal and command handling
    
    In order to support correct suspend and resume several changes were needed:
    1. Switch from work_struct to tasklet for command handling. When device
    suspend is called workqueues are already frozen and can not be used.
    2. Separate host initialization code from driver's probe and don't rely
    on interrupts for host initialization. This, in turn, addresses two
    problems:
     a) Resume needs to re-initialize the host, but can not assume that
        device interrupts were already re-armed.
     b) Previously, probe will return successfully before really knowing
        the state of the host, as host interrupts were not armed in time.
        Now it uses polling to determine the real host state before returning.
    3. Separate termination code from driver's remove. Termination may be caused
    by resume, if media changed type or became unavailable during suspend.

    mmc: Add support for SDHC cards
    
    Thanks to the generous donation of an SDHC card by John Gilmore, and
    the surprisingly enlightened decision by the SD Card Association to
    publish useful specs, I've been able to bash out support for SDHC. The
    changes are not too profound:
    
    i) Add a card flag indicating the card uses block level addressing and
    check it in the block driver. As we never took advantage of byte-level
    addressing, this simply involves skipping the block -> byte
    translation when sending commands.
    
    ii) The layout of the CSD is changed - a set of fields are discarded
    to make space for a larger C_SIZE. We did not reference any of the
    discarded fields except those related to the C_SIZE.
    
    iii) Read and write timeouts are fixed values and not calculated from
    CSD values.
    
    iv) Before invoking SEND_APP_OP_COND, we must invoke the new
    SEND_IF_COND to inform the card we support SDHC.

    mmc: Power quirk for ENE controllers
    
    Support for these devices was broken for 2.6.18-rc1 and later by commit
    146ad66eac836c0b976c98f428d73e1f6a75270d, which added voltage level support.
    
    This restores the previous behaviour for these devices by ensuring that when
    the voltage is changed, only one write to set the voltage is performed.
    
    It may be that both writes are needed if the voltage is being changed between
    two non-zero values or that it's safe to ensure that only one write is done
    if the hardware only supports one voltage; I don't know whether either is the
    case nor can I test since I have only the one SD reader (1524:0550), and it
    supports just the one voltage.

    NFSv4: Ensure non-root user can trigger a referral automount
    
    Currently only root can trigger a referral automount because only root
    can access rpc_pipefs directories. Enabling read access to non-root
    should be harmless (they can still not access the pipes themselves)
    and will suffice to fix this problem.

    I had report that 9x133Mhz CPU is seen as 5x133MHz. So I
    changed multipliers table. That was a mistake. According to
    documentation table was correct. So only way to avoid 5 or 9
    dilema is not use MaxMHzBR for PowerSaver 1.0. One code that
    works on all processors. To do it I need also separate flag for

    [AGPGART] Allow drm-populated agp memory types
    
    This patch allows drm to populate an agpgart structure with pages of its own.
    It's needed for the new drm memory manager which dynamically flips pages in and out of AGP.
    
    The patch modifies the generic functions as well as the intel agp driver. The intel drm driver is
    currently the only one supporting the new memory manager.
    
    Other agp drivers may need some minor fixing up once they have a corresponding memory manager enabled drm driver.
    
    AGP memory types >= AGP_USER_TYPES are not populated by the agpgart driver, but the drm is expected
    to do that, as well as taking care of cache- and tlb flushing when needed.
    
    It's not possible to request these types from user space using agpgart ioctls.
    
    The Intel driver also gets a new memory type for pages that can be bound cached to the intel GTT.

    In asd_initiate_ssp_tmf, the TMF result code is replaced with

    However, TMFs can return result codes via an ESCB... yet these codes are
    also replaced with "FAILED".  The only values that can fall into that case
    are TMF_* codes anyway, so get rid of this code where COMPLETE and SUCCESS

    [SCSI] libsas: Don't BUG when connecting two expanders via wide port
    
    libsas: Don't BUG when connecting two expanders via wide port
    
    When a device is connected to an expander, the discovery process goes through
    sas_ex_discover_dev to figure out what's attached to the phy.  If it is the
    case that the phy being discovered happens to be the second phy of a wide link
    to an expander, that discover_dev function will incorrectly call
    sas_ex_discover_expander, which creates another sas_port and tries to attach the
    other sas_phys to the new port, thus triggering a BUG.  The correct thing to do is
    to check the other ex_phys of the expander to see if there's a sas_port for this
    sas_phy, and attach the sas_phy to the existing sas_port.
    
    This is easily triggered if one enables the phys of a wide port between
    expanders one by one.
    
    This second version of the patch fixes a small regression in the case where
    all the phys show up at once and we accidentally try to attach to a port
    that hasn't been created yet.

    Write does not trigger this bug because the driver refuses in fixed block
    mode writes that are not a multiple of the block size. Read does trigger
    it in my system.
    
    The bug is not associated with any specific HBA. st tries to do direct i/o
    in fixed block mode with reads that are not a multiple of tape block size.
    
    The patch in this message fixes the st problem by switching to using the
    driver buffer up to the next close of the device file in fixed block mode
    if the user asks for a read like this.
    
    I don't know why the bug has surfaced only after 2.6.17 although the st
    problem is old. There may be another bug in the block subsystem and this
    patch works around it. However, the patch fixes a problem in st and in
    this way it is a valid fix.
    
    This patch may also fix the bug 7900.
    
    The patch compiles and is lightly tested.

    Altix: Add ACPI SSDT PCI device support (hotplug)
    
    Support for dynamic loading and unloading of ACPI SSDT tables upon slot
    hotplugs and unplugs.
    
    On SN platforms, we now represent every populated root bus slot with a single
    ACPI SSDT table containing info for every device and PPB attached to the slot.
     These SSDTs are generated by the prom at initial boot and hotplug time.  The
    info in these SSDT tables is used by the SN kernel IO "fixup" code (which is
    called at boot and hotplug time).
    
    On hotplugs (i.e.  enable_slot()), if running with an ACPI capable prom,
    attempt to obtain a new ACPI SSDT table for the slot being hotplugged.  If
    successful, add the table to the ACPI namespace (acpi_load_table()) and then
    walk the new devices and add them to the ACPI infrastructure (acpi_bus_add()).
    
    On hot unplugs (i.e.  disable_slot()), if running with an ACPI capable prom,
    attempt to remove the SSDT table associated with the slot from the ACPI
    namespace (acpi_unload_table_id()) and infastructure (acpi_bus_trim()).
    
    From: John Keller <jpk@sgi.com>
    
     A bug was fixed where the sgi hotplug driver was removing
     the slot's SSDT table from the ACPI namespace a bit too early in
     disable_slot(). Also, we now call acpi_bus_start() subsequent
     to acpi_bus_add().

    ACPI_NUMA: fix HP IA64 simulator issue with extended memory domain
    
    ACPI 3.0 incorporated the SRAT spec, upping the table version to 2,
    and extending the size of the proximity domain from 1-byte to 4-bytes.
    This extension was into a reserved field that firmware should
    set to 0, but the HP simulator had non-zero values there
    resulting in unexpected huge numbers.
    
    So mask the domain down to 8-bits for now.
    A more general fix will be to check the table version
    supplied by firmware and get paranoid about reserved fields.

    does the target resets from delayed work tasks, that in heavy load
    conditions, take too long to be invoked, resulting in command time outs
    This patch will issue target reset immediately from ISR context, and will
    queue remaining target resets to be issued after the previous one completes.
    The delayed work tasks are spawned during the target reset completion.

    ACPICA: Re-implement interpreters' "serialized mode"
    
    Enhanced the implementation of the interpreters'
    serialized mode (boot with "acpi_serialize" to set
    acpi_glb_all_methods_serialized flag.)
    When this mode is specified, instead of creating a serialization
    semaphore per control method, the interpreter lock is
    simply no longer released before a blocking operation
    during control method execution. This effectively makes
    the AML Interpreter single-threaded. The overhead of a
    semaphore per-method is eliminated.

    Completed a new design and implementation for

    multiple OS threads could acquire the global lock
    simultaneously, but this could cause the BIOS to be starved
    by the lock in cases such as the Embedded Controller driver,

    [MTD] OneNAND: Reduce internal BufferRAM operations
    
    It use blockpage instead of a pair (block, page). It can also cover a small chunk access. 0x00, 0x20, 0x40 and so on.
    
    And in JFFS2 behavior, sometimes it reads two pages alternatively.
    e.g., It first reads A page, B page and A page.
    So we check another bufferram to find requested page.

    Commit 592282cf2eaa33409c6511ddd3f3ecaa57daeaaa fixed some missing directory
    c/mtime updates in part by introducing a dinode update in ocfs2_add_entry().
    Unfortunately, ocfs2_link() (which didn't update the directory inode before)
    is now missing a single journal credit. Fix this by doubling the number of
    inode updates expected during hard link creation.

    asus-laptop: add bluetooth and wlan support
    
    WLED and BLED are not handled like other leds (MLED, etc ..),
    because sometime they also control the wlan/bluetooth device.
    If the method for wireless_status is found, it's used to get the
    status, otherwise hotk->status is used.  We also use the HWRS
    method, which tell if the bluetooth/wlan device is present or not.
    This patch show why we need a ASUS_SET_DEVICE_ATTR macro : if
    there is a bluetooth device, /sys/dev.../asus-laptop/bluetooth
    is usable, else it's not but it's clean.

    Add led support, using generic led class.  Thomas Tuttle's patch
    <http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/6/247> was very usefull.  We use
    hotk->status to store led status because it's very hard to find
    acpi method to get the right status...  To reduce the code,
    I use a lot of macro (ASUS_LED, ASUS_LED_REGISTER, etc ...),
    because the code is the same for all leds ...

    [SCSI] libsas: Handle SCSI commands that complete with failure codes
    
    This patch moves the code that handles SAS failures out of the main EH
    function and into a separate function.  It also detects commands that have
    no sas_task (i.e. they completed, but with error data) and sends them into
    scsi_error for processing.  This allows us to handle SCSI errors (and
    enables auto-spinup as a side effect) instead of dropping them on the
    floor and falling into an infinite loop.  It also requires the
    implementation of a device reset function, which the SAS failure code has
    been modified to employ for REQ_DEVICE_RESET.

    [SCSI] libsas: Clean up discovery failure handler code
    
    sas_rphy_delete does two things: it removes the sas_rphy from the transport
    layer and frees the sas_rphy.  This can be broken down into two functions,
    sas_rphy_remove and sas_rphy_free; sas_rphy_remove is of interest to
    sas_discover_root_expander because it calls functions that require
    sas_rphy_add as a prerequisite and can fail (namely sas_discover_expander).
    In that case, sas_discover_root_expander needs to be able to undo the effects
    of sas_rphy_add yet leave the job of freeing the sas_rphy to the caller of
    sas_discover_root_expander.
    
    This patch also removes some unnecessary code from sas_discover_end_dev
    to eliminate an unnecessary cycle of sas_notify_lldd_gone/found for SAS
    devices, thus eliminating a sas_rphy_remove call (and fixing a race condition
    where a SCSI target scan can come in between the gone and found call).
    It also moves the sas_rphy_free calls into sas_discover_domain and
    sas_ex_discover_end_dev to complement the sas_rphy_allocation via
    sas_get_port_device.
    
    This patch does not change the semantics of sas_rphy_delete.

    [SCSI] libsas: Fix incorrect sas_port deformation in sas_form_port
    
    Currently, sas_form_port checks the given asd_sas_phy's sas_phy to see if
    there's already a port attached.  If so, the SAS addresses of the port and
    the phy are compared to determine if we need to detach from the port
    because the addresses don't match or if we can stop; the SAS address stored
    in the sas_port reflects whatever device _was_ attached to the port/phy, and
    the SAS address stored in the sas_port reflects whatever device we just
    discovered.  As written, the code detaches from the port if the addresses
    _do_ match, and prints an error if they do _not_ match.  I believe this to
    be incorrect, as it seems more logical to keep the port if the addresses
    match (i.e. the phy was reset but the device didn't change), and detach it
    they do not (i.e. the device changed).

    [POWERPC] 83xx: Return a point to the struct ipic from ipic_init()
    
    It's useful to have access to struct ipic handle that just got created
    in ipic_init().
    
    For example, if we want to setup an external IRQ with out
    a device node we need access ipic->irqhost to create the virtual to HW
    IRQ mapping and to set the IRQ sense.  With this we can mimic the old
    sense array concept that existed in arch/ppc.

    ACPI: remove motherboard driver (redundant with PNP system driver)
    
    The PNP system board driver (drivers/pnp/system.c) contains all the
    same functionality, so we don't need the ACPI version.
    
    Previously, a motherboard device would be claimed by *both* the ACPI and
    PNP drivers, resulting in stuff like this in /proc/ioports:
    
        1200-121f : motherboard	<-- from drivers/acpi/motherboard.c
          1200-121f : pnp 00:0d	<-- from drivers/pnp/system.c
    
    Make sure to enable CONFIG_PNP (and CONFIG_PNPACPI) to include the
    PNP system board driver.

    i386: turn on CONFIG_PNP in defconfig
    
    I'm trying to remove drivers/acpi/motherboard.c, which is mostly
    redundant with drivers/pnp/system.c.  So make sure that we include the
    PNP driver in the default config.  Most distros enable this already.
    
    Turning on CONFIG_PNP also causes the following options to be enabled:
    
        CONFIG_PNPACPI
        CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_PNP
    
    CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_PNP causes legacy serial ports to be discovered
    twice, which is ugly but harmless:
    
        serial8250: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A

    ACPI: move FADT resource reservations from motherboard driver to osl
    
    Resources described by the FADT aren't really a good fit for the
    ACPI motherboard driver.
    
    The motherboard driver cares about PNP0C01 and PNP0C02 devices and
    their resources.
    
    The FADT describes some resources used by the ACPI core.  Often, they
    are also described by by the _CRS of a motherboard device, but I think
    it's better to reserve them specifically in the ACPI osl.c because
    (a) the motherboard driver is optional and ACPI uses the resources even
    if the driver is absent, and (b) I want to remove the ACPI motherboard
    driver because it's mostly redundant with the PNP system.c driver.

    [POWERPC] 83xx: Don't call ioremap in the reset function
    
    It's possibly that we get an reset requestion when interrupts are disabled.
    (For example an oops in an interrupt handler).  Therefor, we can't call
    ioremap in the reset function.  Moving the ioremap of the registers we
    need access to an arch_initcall helps the problem.
    
    However we still have a window between boot and the arch_initcall in
    which the register pointer will not be setup and thus we spin if the reset
    function is called.  If one needs to ensure even this case is covered, look
    at use of the watchdog provided on 83xx to reset the processor.

    One test case ended up SEGV'ing. Upon closer inspection ld.so was loaded
    at 0x8000000 (128MB) with the heap right after it. Since we normally
    link binaries at 0x10000000 (256MB) we only had about 128MB of space for
    the heap:
    
    00100000-00103000 r-xp 00100000 00:00 0           [vdso]
    08000000-0801e000 r-xp 00000000 00:01 33079       /lib/ld-2.5.so
    0802d000-0802f000 rwxp 0001d000 00:01 33079       /lib/ld-2.5.so
    0802f000-08050000 rwxp 0802f000 00:00 0           [heap]
    0fe91000-0ffd9000 r-xp 00000000 00:01 33082       /lib/libc-2.5.so
    0ffd9000-0ffe8000 ---p 00148000 00:01 33082       /lib/libc-2.5.so
    0ffe8000-0ffea000 r--p 00147000 00:01 33082       /lib/libc-2.5.so
    0ffea000-0ffed000 rwxp 00149000 00:01 33082       /lib/libc-2.5.so
    10000000-10004000 r-xp 00000000 00:01 76          /bin/sleep
    10013000-10014000 rwxp 00003000 00:01 76          /bin/sleep
    ffb41000-ffb56000 rw-p ffb41000 00:00 0           [stack]
    
    One way to fix this is move ELF_ET_DYN_BASE from 0x08000000 to 0x20000000.
    This allows 128MB for the binary (hopefully enough for even the most
    crazy c++ apps), and with our current layout we will grow the heap up
    and the stack down, allowing potentially gigabytes of heap:
    
    00100000-00103000 r-xp 00100000 00:00 0           [vdso]

    JFS: call io_schedule() instead of schedule() to avoid deadlock
    
    The introduction of Jens Axboe's explicit i/o plugging patches introduced a
    deadlock in jfs.  This was caused by the process initiating I/O not
    unplugging the queue before waiting on the commit thread.  The commit
    thread itself was waiting for that I/O to complete.  Calling io_schedule()
    rather than schedule() unplugs the I/O queue avoiding the deadlock, and it
    appears to be the right function to call in any case.

    Now that task aborts and device port resets are done by the EH, we can
    remove all the code that set up workqueues and such and simply call
    sas_task_abort and let libsas figure things out.

    [SCSI] libsas: Delay issuing ABORT TASK TMF until the error handler
    
    sas_task_abort() should simply abort the upper-level SCSI command and wait
    until the error handler to send the actual ABORT TASK command.  By
    deferring things to the EH we simplify the concurrency coordination and
    eliminate some race conditions.  Note that sas_task_abort has a few hooks
    to handle libsas internal commands properly too.
    
    Also rename do_sas_task_abort to __sas_task_abort just in case we really
    want to abort the task *right now* and we don't have a scsi_cmnd attached
    to the command.  This is a hook for libata internal commands to abort.

    [SCSI] libsas: Enable the EH strategy handler to reset a phy after a command
    
    When a SAS LLDD needs to request a device port reset, it needs to have all
    commands aborted before it can reset the port.  Since commands are put on
    the EH's list in the order that they were queued, the LLDD can set a "need
    reset" flag in the last task to be aborted so that the EH can reset the
    port after all commands are aborted.

    [SCSI] aic94xx: Don't eat TMF_QUERY_TASK results
    
    In this driver, TMF_QUERY_TASK translates to QUERY_SSP_TASK.  The
    sequencer, it seems, is perfectly happy sending us a SSP response, which
    this function promptly "converts" into TMF_RESP_FUNC_FAILED.  This leads to

    the conversion in this case.

    [SCSI] libsas: Reset timer on taskless scsi_cmnds in sas_scsi_timed_out
    
    Every so often, a scsi_cmnd will time out, and the libsas timeout handler
    will discover that the scsi_cmnd does not have a sas_task attached to it.
    This can happen in two cases: (1) the scsi_cmnd actually made it through
    libsas to the HBA and is now going through scsi_done, or (2) the
    scsi_cmnd has been held up (host lock, slab alloc, etc) and libsas has
    not yet attached a sas_task.  In both cases, it is safe to ask SCSI for
    more time to process the command via EH_RESET_TIMER; we cannot blindly
    return EH_HANDLED because if (2) happens, we could end up calling
    scsi_done while another CPU is heading towards sas_queuecommand, which
    causes slab corruption when sas_task_done updates the freed scsi_cmnd.

    [SCSI] libsas: Don't give scsi_cmnds to the EH if they never made it to the SAS LLDD or have already returned
    
    On a system with many SAS targets, it appears possible that a scsi_cmnd
    can time out without ever making it to the SAS LLDD or at the same time
    that a completion is occurring.  In both of these cases, telling the
    LLDD to abort the sas_task makes no sense because the LLDD won't know
    about the sas_task; what we really want to do is to increase the timer.
    Note that this involves creating another sas_task bit to indicate
    whether or not the task has been sent to the LLDD; I could have
    implemented this by slightly redefining SAS_TASK_STATE_PENDING, but
    this way seems cleaner.
    
    This second version amends the aic94xx portion to set the
    TASK_AT_INITIATOR flag for all sas_tasks that were passed to
    lldd_execute_task.

    Clean the current code before we convert the driver to a platform_device.
    This clean consists of:
    - document the includes
    - make sure that the printk's use the module/driver-name
    - do the exit of the module exactly the opposite of the init of the module

    [WATCHDOG] pcwd_usb.c - get heartbeat from dip switches
    
    The PCWD cards normally use the heartbeat that is set via
    the dip-switches of the card. There are only 3 switches,
    thus 8 combinations that each have a certain heartbeat.
    The card can however be programmed with a heartbeat from
    1 till 65535 seconds. This is what our driver does: it
    programs the heartbeat on the card.
    
    There are however a lot of people that don't know that
    we set the heartbeat of the watchdog card to the value
    provided by the heartbeat module parameter. Instead they
    think that the heartbeat value is the same as set by the
    dip-switches.
    
    This patch changes the driver so that at startup you can
    take the heartbeat from the dip-switches. You do this
    by setting the heartbeat module parameter to 0. This
    patch also makes this the default behaviour.

    ACPI: use more understandable bus_id for ACPI devices
    
    Some of the ACPI devices use the internal fake hids
    which are exposed to userspace as devces' bus_id after sysfs conversion.
    To make it more friendly, we convert them to more understandable strings.
    
    For those devices w/o PNPids, we use "device:instance_no" as the bus_id
    instead of "PNPIDNON:instance_no".

    ACPI: fix Supermicro X7DB8+ Boot regression
    
    http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7695
    
    Originally we converted bind/unbind to use a new pci bridge driver.
    The driver will add/remove _PRT, so we can eventually remove
    .bind/.unbind methods.
    
    But we found that some of the _ADR-Based devices don't have _PRT,
    i.e. they are not managed by the new ACPI PCI bridge driver.
    So that .bind method is not called for some _ADR-Based devices,
    which leads to a failure.
    
    Now we make ACPI PCI Root Bridge Driver scan and binds all _ADR-Based devices
    once the driver is loaded, in the .add method of ACPI PCI Root Bridge driver.
    
    Extra code path for calling .bind/.unbind when _ADR-Based devices
    are hot added/removed is also added.

    ACPI: use PNPID:instance_no as bus_id of ACPI device
    
    Previously we used the device name in the DSDT, but would
    crash upon encountering a duplicate. Also, exposing the
    DSDT device name to the user in a patch isn't a good idea,
    because it is arbitrary.
    
    After some discussion, we finally decided to use
    "PNPID:instance_no" as the bus_id of ACPI devices.
    
    Two attributes for each device are added at the same time,
    the full pathname in ACPI namespace and hardware_id if it has.
    
    NOTE:	acpi_bus_id_list is used to keep the information of PNPID
    	and instance number of the given PNPID. Loop the
    	acpi_bus_id_list to find the instance_no of the	same PNPID
    	when register a device. If failed, i.e. we don't have a
    	node with this PNPID, allocate one and link it to this list.
    
    NOTE:	Now I don't take the memory free work in charge.
    	If necessary, I can add a reference count in
    	struct acpi_device_bus_id, and check the reference and
    	when unregister a device, i.e. memory is freed when
    	the reference count of a given PNPID is 0.

    [PARISC] Fix PCI bus numbering in the presence of Cardbus bridges
    
    Firmware ignores Cardbus bridges, so when Linux assigns bus numbers,
    it must override firmware's notion of what the busses are numbered.
    This is not sufficient to support the Cardbus bridge as there is also
    no interrupt routing table entry for them.

    [PARISC] [MUX] Make the Serial Mux driver work as module
    
    The following updates are based off a patch from willy:
      * Removal of the mux_card list.
      * Add the mux_remove function.
    
    Other updates:
      * Re-organize the driver structure a bit to make the
        mux_init and mux_exit functions more symmetrical.
      * Added the del_timer.
      * Unregistered the console.
    
    At this point I can insmod, rmmod, and re-insmod the
    mux without any failures.
