    [PATCH] insert_resource fix
    
    I noticed that insert_resource() incorrectly handles the case of an
    existing parent resource with the same ending address as a newly added
    child.  This results in incorrect nesting, like the following:
    
    	# cat /proc/ioports

    	002f0000-002fffff : PCI Bus #48

    [NETFILTER]: Don't assign new helper after NAT when there are already expectations present.
    
    Tracked down by Raivis Bucis <raivis@mt.lv>
    
    This patch fixes an oops while listing /proc/net/ip_conntrack.
    
    When a helper sets up expectations based on the first packet (tftp),
    NAT can still change the packet and cause conntrack to look for a new helper
    based on the new tuple. When no helper is found, expectant->helper will be
    NULL, which leads to an oops in print_expect().
    
    Only assign a new helper in ip_conntrack_alter_reply() if there are no
    expectations.

    [PATCH] Fix nfs writepage behaviour
    
    From: Nick Piggin <nickpiggin@yahoo.com.au>
    
    nfs_writepage() refuses to write back mapped pages at all on the page
    reclaim path, causing systems to get locked up when there's a lot of dirty
    mmapped data around.  The patch changes NFS so that it will start I/O
    against these pages.
    
    The code as it stands is designed to defer writeout to pdflush which can do
    larger, more efficient I/Os.  But there shouldn't be much traffic by this
    path, and going slow is better than not going at all.
    
    Patch originally from Trond.

    [PATCH] Fix x86-64 VIA systems with IOMMU debug
    
    VIA chipsets are broken and don't work with IOMMU enabled. For some mysterious
    reason (the IOMMU logic is actually in the CPU) they manage to corrupt all
    data going through the aperture to PCI devices.
    
    There was a workaround previously that enabled the slower softmmu when VIA is
    detected on the normal IOMMU path (when there is more than 3GB of memory). But
    CONFIG_IOMMU_DEBUG took a short cut that was not handled, which ended up with
    VIA systems not booting when this option is enabled.
    
    This patch enables the workaround with CONFIG_IOMMU_DEBUG/iommu=force too

    [PATCH] ia64: fix race in fsys_bubble_down to avoid fp-register corruption
    
    The fast system-call fall-back-path has a race: it reads PSR, modifies
    some bits, then writes back the new PSR.  Unfortunately, the contents
    of PSR may change between reading and writing it.  For example, an
    interrupt could occur which could trigger a context-switch.  The
    context-switch might in turn flush the floating-point-high (FPH)
    partition to memory, clear PSR.MFH, and set PSR.DFH.  To prevent this
    race, the patch below turns off PSR.I before reading PSR.
    
    This fixes a floating-point corruption problem that was observed on a
    system with a libc which has the fast system-call support enabled.
    
    The performance impact is minimal (on the order of a handful of cycles).

    [PATCH] Update Documentation/filesystems/Locking
    
    From: Anton Altaparmakov <aia21@cam.ac.uk>
    
    A filesystem's ->writepage() implementation nowadays must run either
    redirty_page_for_writepage() or the combination of set_page_writeback()/
    end_page_writeback().  Failure to do so leaves the page itself marked clean
    but it is tagged as dirty in the radix tree (PAGECACHE_TAG_DIRTY).  This
    incoherency can lead to all sorts of hard-to-debug problems in the
    filesystem like having dirty inodes at umount and losing written data.
    
    The patch updates Documentation/filesystems/Locking to reflect this
    requirement.

    [PATCH] vmscan: try harder for GFP_NOFS allocators
    
    Page reclaim bales out very early if reclaim isn't working out for !__GFP_FS

    It was a fairly arbitrary thing in the first place and chances are the caller
    will simply retry the allocation or will do something which is disruptive to
    userspace.  So remove that code and do much more scanning.

    [PATCH] vmscan: handle synchronous writepage()
    
    Teach page reclaim to understand synchronous ->writepage implementations.
    
    If ->writepage completed I/O prior to returning we can proceed to reclaim the
    page without giving it another trip around the LRU.
    
    This is beneficial for ramdisk-backed S_ISREG files: we can reclaim the file's
    pages as fast as the ramdisk driver needs to allocate them and this prevents
    I/O errors due to OOM in rd_blkdev_pagecache_IO().

    [CPUFREQ] Fix cpufreq on ARM
    
    cpufreq doesn't appear to initialise on ARM - cpufreq_register_driver()
    fails with -ENODEV.
    
    This appears to be because we register cpus at subsys_initcall() time,
    and cpufreq drivers at arch_initcall() time.  We need cpufreq up and
    running before any drivers are initialised since their timings depend
    on the CPU clock rate.

    How does this simple patch look. Beyond this, we may have to change some

    [IPV6]: Initialize pmtu/advmss in ndisc dst entries.
    
    When creating dst entry from ndisc, the dst entry of pmtu is not set, and the
    outout for this kind of dst entry is set to ip_output2 instead of ip_output.
    This could lead to send bigger packets through these des entries without
    fragmentation, and uninitialized pmtu could lead the network unreachable.
    
    These problems are easy reproduced when configuring IPSEC for ipv6. IPSEC
    could pick up dst entry created by ndisc as child des entry if ndisc dst
    entry generated earlier. If sending bigger packets through IPSEC, the ip
    output2 will send bigger packets out, the driver will drop these packets on
    receiver side. Also the dst_entry pmtu will be 0, the network is unreachable.
    
    The patch has been tested against 2.6.6. I am not sure why ndisc genereats dst
    entry with output equal to ip6_output2 not ip6_output. If ndisc sends bigger
    packets, it will break also.

    NTFS: 2.1.14 - Fix an NFSd caused deadlock reported by several users.
    
    - Modify fs/ntfs/ntfs_readdir() to copy the index root attribute value
      to a buffer so that we can put the search context and unmap the mft
      record before calling the filldir() callback.  We need to do this
      because of NFSd which calls ->lookup() from its filldir callback()
      and this causes NTFS to deadlock as ntfs_lookup() maps the mft record
      of the directory and since ntfs_readdir() has got it mapped already
      ntfs_lookup() deadlocks.

    [PATCH] fix ide-cd racy completions
    
    This bug took forever to debug (just ask Ben :-).
    
    When we move the completion event from the failed request to the sense
    request, we risk either the initial complete and then later complete on
    a long gone ->waiting.  I think this business of moving the completion
    structure to the request sense is a bit bogus and always has been, and
    the bug is fixed nicely by just rewriting this logic a bit.  So instead
    we simply unconditionally dequeue the failed request (regardless of
    whether it was REQ_PC or REQ_BLOCK_PC), and pass a reference to it in
    the sense request.  When the sense completes, we call end io on the
    originally failed request (which does the complete() etc).

    dup_mmap() unnecessarily tries to account for memory of the vma's it has

    However, that's pointless (and wrong), since the exit_mmap() path called

    Just remove the bogus un-accounting code.

    From: Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>
    
    The recent change to vga16fb's memory mapping that you partially reverted
    is still broken.  In particular, it's setting fix.mem_start to a virtual
    address on i386.  The value of fix.mem_start is meant to be physical.
    
    We could simply apply virt_to_phys to it, but somehow I doubt that is what
    it's meant to do on arm.  So until we hear from someone who knows how it
    works on arm, let's just revert this change.

    [PATCH] fix uts sysctl write size
    
    From: Andy Whitcroft <apw@shadowen.org>
    
    The sysctl interfaces for updating the uts entries such as hostname and
    domainname are using the wrong length for these buffers; they are hard
    coded to 64.  Although safe, this artifically limits the size of these
    fields to one less than the true maximum.  This generates an inconsistency
    between the various methods of update for these fields.

    [PATCH] cyclone: PIT sanity checking
    
    From: john stultz <johnstul@us.ibm.com>
    
    In testing for SLES9, we ran across a bug caused by userspace apps poking
    the PIT which caused bad values to be read by the kernel.  This would then
    trigger the lost tick detection code with insane values and would then
    break the SCSI subsystem.
    
    This patch includes the PIT sanity check from the TSC timesource into the
    cyclone timesource code, which catches the bad case described above and
    resolves the issue.

    [PATCH] s390: add support for 6 system call arguments (FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE)
    
    From: Martin Schwidefsky <schwidefsky@de.ibm.com>
    
    This patch adds support for 6 system call arguments on s390.  The first
    exploiter of this will be the sys_futex system call for the
    FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE operation.  The idea is simple: use register %r7 for the
    6th argument.  This can be extended to 7/8/9/...  arguments if there ever
    will be the need for it.  To call the system call function in the kernel
    the additional arguments needs to get stored on the stack.  8 bytes are
    added to the head of struct pt_regs.  %r7 is stored to the additional field
    for all system calls.  The store is hidden in a
    address-generation-interlock slot, it doesn't slow down the system call
    path.

    cdrom_has_defect_mgt() has the same ->data_len bug - the length field is

    4, not + 8.  However, just kill the length check.  Comparison of

    [PATCH] jbd: descriptor buffer state fix
    
    Fix a problem discovered by Jeff Mahoney <jeffm@suse.com>, based on an initial
    patch from Chris Mason <mason@suse.com>.
    
    journal_get_descriptor_buffer() is used to obtain a regular old buffer_head
    against the blockdev mapping.  The caller will populate that bh by hand and
    will then submit it for writing.
    
    But there are problems:
    
    a) The function sets bh->b_state nonatomically.  But this buffer is
       accessible to other CPUs via pagecache lookup.
    
    b) The function sets the buffer dirty and then the caller populates it and
       then it is submitted for I/O.  Wrong order: there's a window in which the
       VM could write the buffer before it is fully populated.
    
    c) The function fails to set the buffer uptodate after zeroing it.  And one
       caller forgot to mark it uptodate as well.  So if the VM happens to decide
       to write the containing page back __block_write_full_page() encounters a
       dirty, not uptodate buffer, which is an illegal state.  This was generating
       buffer_error() warnings before we removed buffer_error().
    
       Leaving the buffer not uptodate also means that a concurrent reader of
       /dev/hda1 could cause physical I/O against the buffer, scribbling on what
       we just put in it.
    
       So journal_get_descriptor_buffer() is changed to mark the buffer
       uptodate, under the buffer lock.
    
    I considered changing journal_get_descriptor_buffer() to return a locked
    buffer but there doesn't seem to be a need for this, and both callers end up
    using ll_rw_block() anyway, which requires that the buffer be unlocked again.
    
    Note that the journal_get_descriptor_buffer() callers dirty these buffers with
    set_buffer_dirty().  That's a bit naughty, because it could create dirty
    buffers against a clean page - an illegal state.  They really should use
    mark_buffer_dirty() to dirty the page and inode as well.  But all callers will
    immediately write and clean the buffer anyway, so we can safely leave this
    optimising cheat in place.

    NTFS: 2.1.13 - Enable overwriting of resident files and housekeeping of system files.
    - Mark the volume dirty when (re)mounting read-write and mark it clean
      when unmounting or remounting read-only.  If any volume errors are
      found, the volume is left marked dirty to force chkdsk to run.
    - Add code to set the NT4 compatibility flag when (re)mounting
      read-write for newer NTFS versions but leave it commented out for now
      since we do not make any modifications that are NTFS 1.2 specific yet
      and since setting this flag breaks Captive-NTFS which is not nice.
      This code must be enabled once we start writing NTFS 1.2 specific
      changes otherwise Windows NTFS driver might crash / cause corruption.
    - Fix a silly bug that caused a deadlock in ntfs_mft_writepage().
      For inode 0, i.e. $MFT itself, we cannot use ilookup5() from
      there because the inode is already locked by the kernel
      (fs/fs-writeback.c::__sync_single_inode()) and ilookup5() waits
      until the inode is unlocked before returning it and it never gets
      unlocked because ntfs_mft_writepage() never returns.  )-:
      Fortunately, we have inode 0 pinned in icache for the duration
      of the mount so we can access it directly.

    [PATCH] ethtool power manglement hooks
    
    Several ethernet drivers have been broken by the ethtool support because
    the ioctl code used to power the interface up and down as needed. Rather
    than add this to each driver call Jeff Garzik suggested we add hooks
    for before/after ethtool processing.
    
    This patch implements them which makes fixing the PM stuff easier,
    as the epic100 patch to follow will show. It also cleans up the
    via-velocity driver pm/ethtool logic a great deal. As per Jeff's
    request the before handler is allowed to fail the operation.

    [PATCH] Make tda1004x DVB frontend driver work again
    
    Adrian Bunk noticed that the tda1004x DVB frontend driver was broken and
    sent a small patch that at least made the driver work again.
    
    There was a discussion afterwards about the kernel syscall interface,
    but at the end, the tda1004x DVB frontend driver is still non-functional.
    
    This re-applies the temporary band-aid.

    [PATCH] Make paca xCurrent field be a pointer
    
    The paca struct contains a pointer to the current task, which is used
    for the `current' macro.  For some reason, this field is a u64, and
    every time we use it we need a cast, because it is really a pointer.
    This patch cleans things up a little by making it a pointer to struct
    task_struct and removing the casts.  It also removes a now-incorrect
    comment which said that r13 contains current (it now holds
    &paca[smp_processor_id()]).

    [PATCH] Single-stepping emulated instructions
    
    Occasionally the ppc64 kernel emulates a usermode instruction, for
    example in the alignment exception handler.  Kumar Gala pointed out
    (in the context of the ppc32 kernel) that if the instruction was being
    single-stepped, and we end up emulating the instruction, we should
    then send the process a SIGTRAP as if it had not been emulated and the
    process had then taken a single-step exception.  This patch implements
    this for ppc64.

    [PATCH] USB: Fix problems with cyberjack usb-serial-module since kernel 2.6.2
    
    > Send me a patch to back those changes out to fix your device and I'll
    > apply it.  If the author is around to realize this, that should wake
    > them up :)
    
    Ok, here you are! :)
    Attached is a patch for linux-2.6.7-rc2. (though the patch hasn't changed
    since -rc1)
    
    Again a short description:
    (the patch removes most of the changes done in linux-2.6.2)
    1. Removed the local buffer of cyberjack_write, because something goes wrong
    upon a write-request bigger than the buffer. Without this, a write-request
    stalls with error -3.
    2. Removed some usb_clear_halt() lines. Without this, the device doesn't even
    open and returns -7.
    
    It works for my cyberjack pinpad USB card reader on
    - nforce2 chipset
    - VIA KM266 chipset
    - AMD Irongate chipset

    [PATCH] ppc64: make the TLB flush logic match ppc32
    
    Adds a dummy flush_tlb_page_nohash() called by ptep_set_access_bits(),
    to be used if we ever have a ppc64 CPU with software loaded TLB.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Fix CPUs with soft loaded TLB
    
    The recent introduction of ptep_set_access_flags() with the optimisation
    of not flushing the TLB unfortunately broke ppc32 CPUs with no hash
    table.
    
    The data access exception code path in assembly for these doesn't
    properly deal with the case where the TLB entry is present with the
    wrong PAGE_RW and will just call do_page_fault again instead of just
    replacing the TLB entry.
    
    Fixing the asm code for all the different CPU types affected (yah,
    embedded PPCs all have different MMUs =P) is painful and need testing I
    can't do at the moment, so here's a fix that will just flush the TLB
    page when changing the access flags on non-hash based machines.  Please
    apply.

    [PATCH] sched: honor the "sync" wakeup bit
    
    The scheduler changes had another thing missing: the appreciation of
    sync wakeups.  (I had this in one of the earlier sched-domains cleanup
    patches before but it got lost in the shuffle.)
    
    When a sync waker is waking, we should subtract its load from the
    current load - it will schedule away for sure in the near future.
    That's what the "sync" bit means.
    
    This change is necessary because with the sched-domains balancer we have
    a much more sensitive cpu-load estimator, and in this particular context
    of try_to_wake_up() the sync waker's effect will always be part of the
    load.  Patch against your patch attached.
    
    In my testing there's an additional increase in bw_pipe numbers on a
    dual P2 box, it went from 110-120 MB/sec to 120-130 MB/sec.

    [PATCH] sched: improve wakeup-affinity
    
    David Mosberger noticed bw_pipe was way down on sched-domains kernels on
    SMP systems.
    
    That is due to two things: first, the previous wake-affine logic would
    *always* move a pipe wakee onto the waker's CPU.  With the scheduler
    rework, this was toned down a lot (but extended to all types of wakeups).
    
    One of the ways this was damped was with the logic: don't move the wakee if
    its CPU is relatively idle compared to the waker's CPU.  Without this, some
    workloads would pile everything up onto a few CPUs and get lots of idle
    time.
    
    However, the fix was a bit of a blunt hack: if the wakee runqueue was below
    50% busy, and the waker's was above 50% busy, we wouldn't do the move.  I
    think a better way to capture it is what this patch does: if the wakee
    runqueue is below 100% busy, and the sum of the two runqueue's loads is
    above 100% busy, and the wakee runqueue is less busy than the waker
    runqueue (ie.  CPU utilisation would drop if we do the move), then we don't
    do the move.
    
    After I fixed this, I found things were still getting bounced around quite
    a bit.  The reason is that we were attempting very aggressive idle
    balancing in order to cut down idle time in a dbt2-pgsql workload, which is
    particularly sensitive to idle.
    
    After having Mark Wong (markw@osdl.org) retest this load with this patch,
    it looks like we don't need to be so aggressive.  I'm glad to be rid of
    this because it never sat too well with me.  We should see slightly lower
    cost of schedule and slightly improved cache impact with this change too.

            Pipe-bandwidth is still down about 10% but that may be due to
            unrelated changes (or perhaps warmup effects?).  The AF UNIX bandwidth
            is just mindboggling.  Moreover, with your patch 2.6.7-rc1 shows
            better context-switch times and lower communication latencies (more
            like the numbers you're getting on UP).
    
            So it seems like the overall balance of keeping things on the same CPU
            vs. distributing them across CPUs is improved.

    I also ran some tests on the NUMAQ. kernbench, dbench, hackbench, reaim
    were much the same. tbench was improved, very much so when clients < NR_CPU.

    [PATCH] md: allow md arrays to be resized if devices are large enough.
    
    It is possible to have raid1/4/5/6 arrays that do not use all the space on the
    drive.  This can be done explicitly, or can happen info you, one by one,
    replace all the drives with larger devices.
    
    This patch extends the "SET_ARRAY_INFO" ioctl (which previously invalid on
    active arrays) allow some attributes of the array to be changed and implements
    changing of the "size" attribute.
    
    "size" is the amount of each device that is actually used.  If "size" is
    increased, the new space will immediately be "resynced".

    [PATCH] md: make sure md_check_recovery will remove a faulty device when ->nr_pending hits 0
    
    md_check_recovery only locks a device and does stuff when it thinks there is a
    real likelyhood that something needs doing.  So the test at the top must cover
    all possibilities.
    
    But it didn't cover the possibility that the last outstanding request on a
    failed device had finished and so the device needed to be removed.
    
    As a result, a failed drive might not get removed from the personalities
    perspective on the array, and so it could never be removed from the array as a
    whole.
    
    With this patch, whenever ->nr_pending hits zero on a faulty device,
    MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED is set so that md_check_recovery will do stuff.

    [PATCH] kNFSd: rsc_lookup simplification
    
    rsc_lookup is a bit complicated: it either takes responsibility for the memory
    pointed to by handle.data and sets handle.data to NULL, or it leaves
    handle.data unchanged, in which case the caller is responsible for freeing
    handle.data.  I forgot that the possibility of inserting a negative cache
    entry into the cache meant that this could happen even when rsc_lookup is
    called with set == 0.
    
    Note that the ip_map code has the same bug, not that it seems to matter much,
    since the memory in question in that case is always just a statically
    allocated string.

    [PATCH] ext3: htree rename fix
    
    A problem with htree was recently discovered during Lustre testing when
    files were being renamed within the same directory.  In some cases the
    addition of the new name caused a directory block split and the old
    dir_entry was pointing at the wrong entry, and the wrong entry was removed.
    This would seem entirely possible in a Maildir directory, since the MTA
    will be doing a lot of renames within the same directory.
    
    If old_de is pointing to the newly-added entry (i_ino is the same) we end up
    deleting the new entry instead of the old one.  It looks as if the rename
    never happened.  We need to verify that the name we are unlinking is what we
    expect.
    
    If is also possible that old_de is pointing to the now-unused space at the end
    of a newly-split leaf block, so we still need to try ext3_delete_entry()
    (which will skip the stale entry and return ENOENT) instead of just relying on
    the inum + name check.

    [PATCH] mm: get_user_pages vs. try_to_unmap
    
    Andrea Arcangeli's fix to an ironic weakness with get_user_pages.
    
    try_to_unmap_one must check page_count against page->mapcount before unmapping
    a swapcache page: because the raised pagecount by which get_user_pages ensures
    the page cannot be freed, will cause any write fault to see that page as not
    exclusively owned, and therefore a copy page will be substituted for it - the
    reverse of what's intended.
    
    rmap.c was entirely free of such page_count heuristics before, I tried hard to
    avoid putting this in.  But Andrea's fix rarely gives a false positive; and
    although it might be nicer to change exclusive_swap_page etc.  to rely on
    page->mapcount instead, it seems likely that we'll want to get rid of
    page->mapcount later, so better not to entrench its use.

    [PATCH] mm: vma_adjust insert file earlier
    
    For those arches (arm and parisc) which use the i_mmap tree to implement
    flush_dcache_page, during split_vma there's a small window in vma_adjust when
    flush_dcache_mmap_lock is dropped, and pages in the split-off part of the vma
    might for an instant be invisible to __flush_dcache_page.
    
    Though we're more solid there than ever before, I guess it's a bad idea to
    leave that window: so (with regret, it was structurally nicer before) take
    __vma_link_file (and vma_prio_tree_init) out of __vma_link.
    
    vma_prio_tree_init (which NULLs a few fields) is actually only needed when
    copying a vma, not when a new one has just been memset to 0.
    
    __insert_vm_struct is used by nothing but vma_adjust's split_vma case:
    comment it accordingly, remove its mark_mm_hugetlb (it can never create
    a new kind of vma) and its validate_mm (another follows immediately).

    Fix vma_adjust adjust_next wrapping: Rajesh V.  pointed out that if end were
    2GB or more beyond next->vm_start (on 32-bit), then next->vm_pgoff would have
    been negatively adjusted.

    [PATCH] mm: follow_page invalid pte_page
    
    The follow_page write-access case is relying on pte_page before checking
    pfn_valid: rearrange that - and we don't need three struct page *pages.
    
    (I notice mempolicy.c's verify_pages is also relying on pte_page, but I'll
    leave that to Andi: maybe it ought to be failing on, or skipping over, VM_IO
    or VM_RESERVED vmas?)

          are present and ask the user to email us if they see this happening.

    ia64: work around linker bug
    
    Building 2.6.6-ia64-040521, using GNU ld version 2.14.90.0.4 20030523.
    __gp is sometimes set incorrectly.  Instead of being .got + 0x2000000,
    it is set to .data + 0x2000000, which breaks some LTOFF22 and GPREL22
    entries.
    
    This is non-deterministic, changing the path name to the kernel tree
    which changes the size of some messages in .data is enough to make the
    linker get it right.  Force __gp to be based on .got.
    
    HJ Lu says this is fixed in newer versions of binutils but the work around
    is sensible enough that it is a better solution than forcing everybody
    to upgrade binutils.

    In latest linux-2.5 bitkeeper, if you turn on CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU w/

    an MCA in __alloc_percpu().  kmem_cache_alloc_node() gets called with a
    node value of -1.  It seems other architectures are defaulting the
    cpu_to_node map to zero for possible, but not present cpus.  Here's a
    trivial patch that does the same for ia64.

    [PATCH] sparse: the rest of ifr_data cleanups and annotations
    
    	The rest of ->ifr_data cleanups.  A bunch of drivers use address
    of ifr->ifr_ifru, but spell that as &ifr->ifr_data, which expands to
    &ifr->ifr_ifru.ifru_data.  ifr_ifru is a union and in effect they sneak in
    a private field into that union; ifr_ifru.ifru_data is a field in that
    union and it has nothing to do with the things they want to do.  Cleaned
    up by explicit use of &ifr->ifr_ifru.
    
    	Several places where we really use ->ifr_data (i.e. use its value
    and use it as __user pointer) annotated.

    	b44.c: ->ioctl() is broken, since it uses &ifr->ifr_data instead of
    ifr->ifr_data itself.  Surprise, surprise, copy_from_user() on that address
    doesn't do any good...
    
    	baycom_epp.c: does get_user() of the first word of structure, then
    immediately does copy_from_user() on the entire thing and completely ignores
    the value read by get_user() (it uses the same value in copied structure
    instead).  Bogus get_user() call removed.

    [PATCH] ppc64: don't clear MSR.RI in do_hash_page_DSI
    
    Some code that is used on iSeries (do_hash_page_DSI in head.S) was
    clearing the RI (recoverable interrupt) bit in the MSR when it
    shouldn't.  We were getting SLB miss interrupts following that which
    were panicking because they appeared to have occurred at a bad place.
    This patch fixes the problem.  In fact it isn't necessary for
    do_hash_page_DSI to do anything to RI, so the patch changes the code
    to not set or clear it.

    [NETFILTER]: Fix checksum bug for multicast/broadcast packets on postrouting hook.
    
    In a nutshell, skb checksum mangling has been removed from
    nf_hook_slow() and pushed up to whatever really needs to do it.
    
    Namely:  NAT, ip_fw_compat, ipt_TCPMSS, IPSec transforms.
    
    skb_checksum_help() has been changed to perform an skb_copy() if needed
    (e.g. the original problem case where bcast/mcast was cloning packets for
    transmission over loopback, changing ip_summed).
    
    Because of the above, the output path has been modified to take into
    account the fact that an skb may need to be changed in some places.  There
    are some minor changes in the routing code to take care of the now
    different input and output function prototypes.  The ipv6 fragmentation
    code has been modified to detect a changed skb.
    
    The rest of the patch (probably the bulk of it) is simply the result of
    changing to double skb pointers.
    
    I've tested this with ipv4, ipv6, ipsec (including xfrm bundles), NAT and
    the original DHCP test case.  Everything seems to be working ok.

    There are nasty problems with net/bridge/netfilter/* and they'll need to

    lot and while it seems to avoid obvious breakage, it's not a nice code.

    It's still badly broken - it mixes userland and kernel chunks in the

    sock_sendmsg().  Do we still want to support that protocol family,
    anyway?

    Spotted by Joe Perches.
    
    I'm surprised gcc didn't at least warn about this.

    [PATCH] drivers/atm/ambassador.c delousing
    
    Translated to C.  Original was anything but.
    
    BTW, even if they were writing in Pascal, their use of nested functions
    would be gratuitous for such a situation.

    [PATCH] sparse: sound/core/pcm* annotation
    
    The tricky part here was an iterator that used to take a callback and
    argument for that callback as parameters.  Iterator itself didn't care
    what type that argument had been; it's entirely up to callback.  The
    thing is, two callbacks expect (and get) char __user * while other two
    expect (and also get) char __user **.
    
    Iterator used to use void * as "opaque data"; I've switched it to
    unsigned long.  Note that there was nothing that said "it's a pointer" -
    use of callback that would take e.g.  int is also perfectly legitimate.
    
    The rest is triviali annotation.

    	In some cases snd_sb_csp_load() did kmalloc() and copy_from_user()
    under a spinlock.  Split into snd_sb_csp_load() and snd_sb_csp_load_user() -
    ther former always from kernel pointer, the latter - from userland.
    	snd_sb_csp_load_user() doesn't take any locks itself, it just
    does kmalloc, copy_from_user and calls snd_sb_csp_load() to do the rest.

    Unfortunately the check he used trips in the case when

    [PATCH] ppc32: Make ppc32 PCI code more robust
    
    The main thrust of this patch is to make the ppc32 PCI code more
    robust by checking for bus->resource[] being NULL before using it.  We
    can legitimately get elements of bus->resource being NULL and I have
    actually hit that on some machines.  This patch also allows resources
    starting at 0 to be accepted as assigned (we can and do get PCI
    resources starting at 0 in I/O space on PPC machines) and provides a
    sensible default for the case where Open Firmware doesn't give us a
    bus-range property for a PCI bridge.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Use -fPIC instead of -mrelocatable-lib
    
    The ppc32 boot code has a couple of files that are executed very early
    on before the kernel is mapped at the address it is linked at.  We
    have been using -mrelocatable-lib to compile these files, but
    apparently -mrelocatable-lib is deprecated and the gcc developers are
    threatening to remove it.  In fact the -fPIC flag does what we need.
    This patch changes -mrelocatable-lib to -fPIC.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Suppress bogus info in /proc/ppc_htab on 64-bit cpus
    
    In the ppc32 kernel, we have a /proc/ppc_htab file that trawls through
    the MMU hash table and prints various statistics on it such as percent
    occupancy.  However, the hash table entry format is different on
    64-bit cpus (POWER3, G5) which the ppc32 kernel does support (in
    32-bit mode).
    
    This patch disables the scanning of the MMU hash table and printing of
    the statistics that we get from it on 64-bit cpus.  Since the
    statistics are only for interest, and the ppc32 kernel is being used
    less and less on 64-bit cpus now that the ppc64 kernel is in
    reasonable shape, I didn't think it worth while to add code to deal
    with the 64-bit HPTE format.

       and do unregister of the adapter interrupt handler with rcu.
     - ccwgroup: Fix error handling when creating a ccwgroup device.
     - Convert the slow crw kernel thread to a single threaded workqueue.
     - Use the slow crw workqueue to unregister a subchannel after it was
       found not operational to serialize it with other possible unregister/
       register events coming in via machine checks.
     - Trigger a rescan of the css via the slow path if a missing channel path
       is found in __recover_lost_chpids.

    [PATCH] hugetlbpage: reinitialise compound page destructor
    
    From: David Gibson <david@gibson.dropbear.id.au>
    
    Currently the hugepage code stores the hugepage destructor in the mapping
    field of the second of the compound pages.  However, this field is never
    cleared again, which causes tracebacks from free_pages_check() if the
    hugepage is later destroyed by reducing the number in
    /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages.  This patch fixes the bug by clearing the
    mapping field when the hugepage is freed.

    [PATCH] direct-io hole fix
    
    From: Chris Mason <mason@suse.com>
    
    When filling holes via DIRECT_IO, we fall back to normal buffered io.  For
    this to work properly, the direct io funcs have to return a value of zero to
    the file write functions, so the file write functions know where to start
    writing.
    
    In some cases, dio->result was getting returned by direct_io_worker, and that
    wasn't always zero, causing some data not to be written.
    
    From: <akpm@osdl.org>:

    [PATCH] hugetlbpage msync() fix
    
    From: David Gibson <david@gibson.dropbear.id.au>
    
    Currently, calling msync() on a hugepage area will cause the kernel to blow
    up with a bad_page() (at least on ppc64, but I think the problem will exist
    on other archs too).  The msync path attempts to walk pagetables which may
    not be there, or may have an unusual layout for hugepages.
    
    Lucikly we shouldn't need to do anything for an msync on hugetlbfs beyond
    flushing the cache, so this patch should be sufficient to fix the problem.

    [PATCH] aio: fix io_getevents() timer expiry setting
    
    From: William Lee Irwin III <wli@holomorphy.com>
    
    start_jiffies was not respected by set_timeout(), which reread jiffies
    instead of respecting what read_events() passed it.  This difference can be
    significant, particularly if the calling process slept during the
    copy_to_user() operation in read_events().  To correct this, this patch
    teaches it to respect its argument, with the additional bonus of converting
    it to use timespec_to_jiffies() instead of open-coding it.

    [PATCH] sched: balance-on-exec fix
    
    From: Jack Steiner <steiner@sgi.com>
    
    It looks like the call to sched_balance_exec() from do_execve() is in the
    wrong spot.  The code calls sched_balance_exec() before determining whether
    "filename" actually exists.
    
    In many cases, users have several entries in $PATH.  If a full path name is
    not specified on the 'exec" call, the library code iterates thru the files
    in the PATH list until it finds the program.  This can result is numerous
    migrations of the parent process before the program is actually found.

    [PATCH] partition table validity checking
    
    From: Andries Brouwer <Andries.Brouwer@cwi.nl>
    
    The patch examines a putative partition table, and if that doesnt look like a
    valid partition table it goes away again.
    
    Some devices have partition tables (and there are many styles of such), some
    don't.  Traditionally fixed disks have one, floppies don't.  Nobody knows what
    happens with ZIP disks, USB sticks and other such things.  Both the DOS-type
    partition table, and the "big floppy" whole disk FAT filesystem are common.
    It is undesirable for the kernel to detect partitions where there are none.
    This leads to great confusion, sometimes to kernel crashes.
    
    In the particular case of DOS-type partition tables a partition entry has a
    1-byte field boot_ind that traditionally is 0x80 for the boot partition and 0
    for the other three primary partitions.  Linux does not use this field, and
    one sometimes sees tables with all four entries zero.
    
    The patch tells the kernel not to think that something is a valid DOS-type
    partition table when a value other than 0 or 0x80 is encountered.  I think it
    is a fairly safe change: I do not know of any fdisk-type program that will
    write other values there.

    [PATCH] ppc64 gives up too quickly on hotplugged cpu
    
    From: Nathan Lynch <nathanl@austin.ibm.com>
    
    On some systems it can take a hotplugged cpu much longer to come up than it
    would at boot.  If the cpu comes up after we've given up on it, it tends to
    die in its first attempt to kmem_cache_alloc (uninitialized percpu data, I
    imagine).
    
    In my experimentation I haven't seen a processor take more than one second
    to become available; the patch waits five seconds just to be safe.

    [PATCH] shrink_all_memory() fixes
    
    - Off-by-one in balance_pgdat means that we're not scanning the zones all
      the way down to priority=0.
    
    - Always set zone->temp_priority in shrink_caches().  I'm not sure why I had
      the `if (zone->free_pages < zone->pages_high)' test in there, but it's
      preventing us from setting ->prev_priority correctly on the
      try_to_free_pages() path.
    
    - Set zone->prev_priority to the current priority if it's currently a
      "lower" priority.  This allows us to build up the pressure on mapped pages
      on the first scanning pass rather than only on successive passes.

    	          ->mpage_writepages
    
    The best fix for this is to visit all ram-backed filesystems and give them a
    no-op a_ops.writepages.  But baling out if the file is memory-backed is a
    sufficient coverall and is how we handle this in __filemap_fdatawrite().

    When taskfile delivery is improved, we will actually perform

    that some users see.

    [libata promise] revert broken taskfile delivery change
    
    The ->tf_load and ->exec_command driver hooks were changed to assume
    that PIO was the only type of taskfile ever delivered to these functions.
    This will be true... in the future, but not today.  In other drivers
    this change was not needed, but Promise executes commands differently
    due to its "ATA packet" hardware features, so the Promise drivers need
    this change reverted.

    This patch is what we want.  We don't in fact need to do the read
    lock, only the write lock, which is what the original patch did.
    However, we need to do it in ppp_synctty.c as well as ppp_async.c.

    Revert CONFIG_NET_GIGE change.
    
    The proper fix is _not_ NET_ETHERNET or default twiddling,
    but better overall organization of the ethernet driver selection,
    which would include not only CONFIG_NET_GIGE but other options as well.
    
    Reverted back to old behavior until a full and complete solution
    appears (and people like it, of course).

    [PATCH] Fix signal race during process exit
    
    Fix a race identified by Jeremy Kerr <jeremy@redfishsoftware.com.au>: if
    update_process_times() decides to deliver a signal due to process timer
    expiry, it can race with __exit_sighand()'s freeing of task->sighand.
    
    Fix that by clearing the per-process timer state in exit_notify(), while under
    local_irq_disable() and under tasklist_lock.  tasklist_lock provides exclusion
    wrt release_task()'s freeing of task->sighand and local_irq_disable() provides
    exclusion wrt update_process_times()'s inspection of the per-process timer
    state.
    
    We also need to deal with the send_sig() calls in do_process_times() by
    setting rlim_cur to RLIM_INFINITY.

            placeholder for ->writepage (ntfs_mft_writepage()), which for now
            just redirties the page and returns.  Also, at umount time, we for
            now throw away all mft data page cache pages after the last call to
            ntfs_commit_inode() in the hope that all inodes will have been
            written out by then and hence no dirty (meta)data will be lost.  We
            also check for this case and emit an error message telling the user
            to run chkdsk.
          - If the user is trying to enable (dir)atime updates, warn about the
            fact that we are disabling them.

    This patch fixes a problem that "cat /proc/ioports" loops
    on some IA64 machines that use quirk_io_region(). The problem
    is caused by redundant resource claim by quirk_io_region()

    ia64: define pending_irq_cpumask in irq.c
    
    This fixes a build-problem with the Ski simulator.  The simulator doesn't
    include iosapic.c and hence pending_irq_cpumask never got defined.

    [ARM] Update ARM memory region reservations.
    
    Remove 26-bit ARM region reserves.
    
    All region reserves start at PHYS_OFFSET, and we only ever have one,
    so set res_size and reserve the region from PHYS_OFFSET size res_size.
    
    Don't free the .init sections on Integrator/CP - they sit in the SSRAM
    obscured region so we are unable to use them for DMA purposes.

    Add comments on load balancing special cases.
    
    Ingo explains:
    
    The condition is 'impossible', but the whole balancing code is
    (intentionally) a bit racy:
    
                    cpus_and(tmp, group->cpumask, cpu_online_map);
                    if (!cpus_weight(tmp))
                            goto next_group;
    
                    for_each_cpu_mask(i, tmp) {
                            if (!idle_cpu(i))
                                    goto next_group;
                            push_cpu = i;
                    }
    
                    rq = cpu_rq(push_cpu);
                    double_lock_balance(busiest, rq);
                    move_tasks(rq, push_cpu, busiest, 1, sd, IDLE);
    
    in the for_each_cpu_mask() loop we specifically check for each CPU in
    the target group to be idle - so push_cpu's runqueue == busiest [==
    current runqueue] cannot be true because the current CPU is not idle, we
    are running in the migration thread ... But this is not a real problem,
    load-balancing we do in a racy way to reduce overhead [and it's all
    statistics anyway so absolute accuracy is impossible], and active
    balancing itself is somewhat racy due to the migration-thread wakeup
    (and the active_balance flag) going outside the runqueue locks [for
    similar reasons].
    
    so it all looks quite plausible - the normal SMP boxes dont trigger it,
    but Bjorn's 128-CPU setup with a non-trivial domain hiearachy triggers
    it.

    [IPSEC]: Fix xfrm_tunnel leak.
    
    Turns out that the IPIP tunnel used by IPCOMP states are only freed
    if the IPCOMP state is deleted by xfrm_state_delete.
    
    This is not the case for all states.  For example, an immature IPCOMP
    state that dies in add_sa will not go through xfrm_state_delete.
    
    The following patch moves the delete_tunnel call into IPCOMP's
    destructor.  I think it makes more sense there as IPCOMP is the
    only user of the tunnel anyway.

    [AGPGART] Fix broken serverworks tlb flush routine.
    This is horribly broken due to a jiffy wrap bug, we never get out of
    the while loop, preventing booting on a kernel with this driver
    compiled in. (See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=124495)
    
    The warning message there has never been reported in any bug report
    that google can find, so I'm of the opinion that this driver is trying
    to be too clever for its own good.  Rip out the jiffies logic completely,
    it should be totally unnecessary.

    [PATCH] Add FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE futex op
    
    From: Jakub Jelinek <jakub@redhat.com>
    
    FUTEX_REQUEUE operation has been added to the kernel mainly to improve
    pthread_cond_broadcast which previously used FUTEX_WAKE INT_MAX op.
    pthread_cond_broadcast releases internal condvar mutex before FUTEX_REQUEUE
    operation, as otherwise the woken up thread most likely immediately sleeps
    again on the internal condvar mutex until the broadcasting thread releases it.
    
    Unfortunately this is racy and causes e.g.
    http://sources.redhat.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/libc/nptl/tst-cond16.c?rev=1.1&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup&cvsroot=glibc
    to hang on SMP.
    
    http://listman.redhat.com/archives/phil-list/2004-May/msg00023.html contains
    analysis how the hang happens, the problem is if any thread does
    pthread_cond_*wait in between releasing of the internal condvar mutex and
    FUTEX_REQUEUE operation, a wrong thread might be awaken (and immediately go to
    sleep again because it doesn't satisfy conditions for returning from
    pthread_cond_*wait) while the right thread requeued on the associated mutex
    and there would be nobody to wake that thread up.
    
    The patch below extends FUTEX_REQUEUE operation with something FUTEX_WAIT
    already uses:
    
    FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE is passed an additional argument which is the expected value
    of *futex.  Kernel then while holding the futex locks checks if *futex !=
    expected and returns -EAGAIN in that case, while if it is equal, continues
    with a normal FUTEX_REQUEUE operation.  If the syscall returns -EAGAIN, NPTL
    can fall back to FUTEX_WAKE INT_MAX operation which doesn't have this problem,
    but is less efficient, while in the likely case that nobody hit the (small)
    window the efficient FUTEX_REQUEUE operation is used.

    [PATCH] Add watchdog timer to iseries_veth driver
    
    From: David Gibson <david@gibson.dropbear.id.au>
    
    Currently the iSeries virtual ethernet driver has no Tx watchdog timer.
    This makes it vulnerable to clagging up if the other end of connection is
    misbehaving - in particular if it is not giving timely hypervisor level
    acks to our data frams.
    
    This patch adds a watchdog timer which resets the connection to any lpar we
    seem to be having trouble sending to.  With any luck the other end might
    behave better after the reset.  If not, this will at least unclag the queue
    for a while so we can keep talking to the lpars which are behaving
    correctly.

    [PATCH] ppc64: fix missing RELOCs, add linux,phandle property
    
    This fixes a couple of bugs in arch/ppc64/kernel/prom.c.  We were
    missing a couple of places where we needed to use RELOC().  I added the
    RELOC in one case, and in the other, moved the variable that we were
    accessing onto the stack (and reduced its size).  (We use the variable
    to get a property value, but we aren't interested in the value, just in
    whether the property exists or not.  Since we pass the size of the
    variable to the OF getprop call, it won't overflow.) The effect of
    missing the RELOCs would be that random memory locations get used on IBM
    pSeries systems (possibly causing random boot failures).
    
    The other thing that this does is add a linux,phandle property to each
    node, containing the phandle for the node, which is the token that OF
    uses to identify the node.  Some nodes reference other nodes by means
    of their phandle.  Without the linux,phandle property, userspace code
    looking at the OF device-tree image in /proc/device-tree has no way of
    knowing which other node is being referenced.

    [PATCH] Improve `make checkstack'
    
    On i386, stack usually grows with "sub $0x8,%esp" and shrinks with
    "add $0x8,%esp" respectively.  In some cases, though, stack grows with
    "add $0xffffff80,%esp" and shrinks with "sub $0xffffff80,%esp".
    Obviously, we don't want to miss those cases.
    
    Since in either case add and sub seem to be balanced and contain the
    same parameter, we don't need a second regex.  We simply accept hex
    numbers of up to 8 digits and treat them as negative numbers when the
    sub appears to be a little too high.
    
    ...or so I thought.  But another day of testing proved me wrong again.
    
    Some functions do stuff like "sub $0x10,%esp", ..., "add $0x20,%esp".
    In other words, add and sub are *NOT* balanced.  Manual inspection
    showed that 0x20 is a more realistic number, so I accept either
    variant, just in case.  We pay for this with a bunch of duplicates in
    our output, but that beats missing some stack hogs.
    
    In the long run, this script has to be replaced by gcc options,
    really.  Looking at the result and guessing back is such a stupid
    idea.

    [PATCH] Better tulip handling on PA-RISC
    
    This patch improves some of the handling of PA-RISC tulip cards.
    
     - Introduce HAS_SWAPPED_SEEPROM and NEEDS_FAKE_MEDIA_TABLE
     - Only trigger this code on GSC machines.  The pure PCI machines don't
       have these cards.
     - Allow the chip_name to be overridden in tulip_init_one().
     - Fix some indentation.
     - Handle the output from tulip_read_eeprom() better.

    From: "Luiz Fernando N. Capitulino" <lcapitulino@prefeitura.sp.gov.br>

    drivers/net/ixgb/ixgb_main.c:1593: warning: unused variable `hw'
    (catch by J. Cherry).
    
    This happens because `hw' is only used when CONFIG_IXGB_NAPI is not set.
    As `hw' is used only to have the code readable, we can use it for
    !CONFIG_IXGB_NAPI too.

    [PCMCIA] Fix up SOC PCMCIA socket timing calculations
    
    The timing calculations used by the PXA platforms did not always take
    account of the timings handed to us by PCMCIA, and where it did, it
    assumed IO timings for memory windows.
    
    We fix this, and provide a generic function which calculates the
    required timings (in nanoseconds) for IO, memory and attribute
    windows.  The SOC drivers only have to convert this information to
    whatever format the hardware requires to achieve at least these
    timing parameters.

    [PATCH] Avoid excessive stack usage in NFS
    
    Assigning '*wdata' with a dynamic initializer creates a
    temporary structure copy on the stack, and then the final
    data is initialized with a "memcpy()".
    
    As a result, these NFS functions use more than 800 bytes
    of stack-space.
    
    Changing the code to just do a memset followed by explicit
    initialization of the non-zero member variables takes the
    stack usage down to 36 bytes.
    
    Here is a patch that does exactly that.

    [PATCH] sparse: SIOCGIFCONF handling - the rest of it
    
    Fixed the type of SIOCGIFCONF callback; inet instance was already
    correctly annotated, decnet one was _not_.  Moreover, decnet callback
    needed fixing - dereferencing userland address.

    [PATCH] x86-64 update
    
    Add accumulated bug fixes for x86-64 and some minor cleanups.
    
     - Add ptep_set_access_flags from i386
     - Change memory text mapping to 10MB from 40MB to make alias window
       smaller
     - Disable change_page_attr for kernel mapoing for now (wrong, but the
       other code also doesn't work)
     - Add .bss.page_aligned and align interrupt/exception stacks (idea from
       Matt Mackall)
     - Protect sysenter MSR setup against missing registers.
     - Set mce tolerance level to 1 (panic instead of deadlock)
     - Fix cross 4GB bug in find_first_bit (Michael Matz)
     - Add missing memory clobbers in bitops.h (Suresh B.  Siddha)
     - Check kernel size at boot up
     - Set boot cpu online at boot to fix early printk
     - Fix EFER bit definitions (Dave Jones)
     - Fix comments in 32bit syscall table.
     - Quieten all 32bit syscalls that are unimplemented in 32bit.
     - Various MCE fixes suggested by Eric Morton, David Boles et.al.
       More to come.
     - Quieten some printks
     - Fix cpu online check in msr driver
     - Lower polling interval for machine checks to 5 minutes to avoid

    [PATCH] sparse: nf_sockopt() annotation
    
    	netfilter set/getsockopt annotated.  That's a continuation of previous
    patch - by now the only remaining place where setsockopt()/getsockopt()
    userland pointers are not traced is vcc_[sg]etsockopt() and down into the
    ATM drivers.  Everything from that area in net/* should be done by now.
    
    	That's pretty much it as far as non-trivial splitting counts; remaining
    patches in net/* are independent, tty and console stuff is also not hard to
    split (not much of it, anyway) and what remains is arch-dependent code for
    alpha and amd64.  Of course there'll be more stuff coming, but as far as I'm
    concerned the rest of my pile is managable - and finally below 200Kb.  That'll
    go tomorrow - right now I'm going down and getting some sleep...

    [PATCH] sparse (compat_ioctl): fb colourmap stuff
    
    	Similar to previous - annotated, killed helper, made the thing
    type-clean, cleaned up.

    [PATCH] sparse (compat_ioctl): CDROM_SEND_PACKET handling
    
    	annotated, killed useless (and type-buggering - void ** is not
    assignment-compatible with foo **) helper, cleaned up.

    [PATCH] sparse (compat_ioctl): font stuff
    
    	Annotated, cleaned up, wholesale copying of structure with
    subsequeunt casts from hell replaced with get_user()/put_user() on
    the fields we really need.

    [PATCH] sparse (compat_ioctl): raw_ioctl() fixes
    
    	Whoever had done the translation apparently never heard of
    big-endian boxen.  Replaced the kludge with get_user()/put_user() on
    64bit values.  Note that
    struct raw_config_request
    {
            int     raw_minor;
            __u64   block_major;
            __u64   block_minor;
    };
    has __u64 on _all_ platforms and it is used as an integer in raw.c code.
    The only reason why translation is needed at all is alignment for 64bit
    values; block_major and block_minor themselves should be passed as-is.
    
    	Breakage fixed, entire area annotated.

    [PATCH] sparse: compat_ioctl - easy part
    
    	Easy parts of compat_ioctl fixes - pure __user annotation.
    In one place (SG_IO handling) replaced dereference of user pointer
    with put_user() (why whoever had noticed that just put a FIXME instead
    of obvios fix is a mistery...)

    [PATCH] sparse: bits and pieces
    
    Independent minor bits caught by sparse:
    
     - paride.h mixing void and int in ? :, used always in a void context
       ide-iops.c return insw() - insw is void()
     - scsi/constants.c uses undefined macros in #if; added #define to 0 in
       case that used to leave it undefined
     - usb/host/hcd.h: fixed-point arithmetics in constant
     - fs/exec.c: missing UL on a large constant
     - fs/locks.c: #if where #ifdef should've been
     - fs.h: missing UL on MAX_LFS_FILESIZE in 64bit case

    Don't need all the network sysfs code if CONFIG_SYSFS is not enabled.
    Also:
    	* netdev_sysfs_unregister is declaration mismatch
    	* if netdev_sysfs_register fails print a warning.
    	  Need to still mark it as registered so the unregister_netdevice works,
    	  but we will probably end up leaking memory in that case.

    [PATCH] fs/dcache.c: avoid race when updating nr_unused count of unused dentries.
    
    From: NeilBrown <neilb@cse.unsw.edu.au>
    
    d_count == 1 is no guarantee that dentry is on the dentry_unused list, even
    if it has just been incremented inside dcache_lock, as dput can decrement
    at any time.
    
    This test from Greg Banks is much safer, and is more transparently correct.

    [PATCH] dm-ioctl: replace dm_[add|remove]_wait_queue() with dm_wait_event()
    
    From: Kevin Corry <kevcorry@us.ibm.com>
    
    Some testing of DM multipath has turned up a problem with the DEVICE_WAIT
    command.  In the tests, while performing a DEVICE_WAIT on a multipath device,
    the command sometimes returns immediately, even though the event-number is
    correct and no path-failure has occurred to trigger an event.  The problem was
    tracked down to the call to schedule() in dev_wait(), which would return even
    though it was not woken up by a DM table event.
    
    This patch moves the responsibility for waiting from the ioctl interface into
    the core driver, and uses wait_event_interruptible() instead of relying on
    wait-queues and schedule().

    [PATCH] i386: put irq stacks in .bss.page_aligned section
    
    From: Matt Mackall <mpm@selenic.com>
    
    I noticed that my vmlinux BSS had grown from 17k to 45k between 2.6.5 and
    2.6.6.  8k was moving a pair of objects in head.S from the text section to
    bss, 8k was the introduction of IRQ stacks, while the remainder (12k) was
    page alignment slop, some of it spurious.  The following patch brings BSS
    down to the expected 33k.
    
    Throw the IRQ stacks into the page aligned section to avoided wasted BSS
    space.  While we'd expect this to save up to 4k, this saves over 10k of BSS
    here due to gcc3.3 spuriously aligning other objects in the vicinity.

    [PATCH] ppc64: remove silly debug path from get_vsid()
    
    From: David Gibson <david@gibson.dropbear.id.au>
    
    Currently the get_vsid() and get_kernel_vsid() functions have a test which
    enables a different VSID algorithm for debugging.  Using a dumb VSID
    algorithm for stressing the hash table is a reasonable debugging tool, but
    switching it at runtime makes no sense at all.  Plus it adds another test
    and memory access to the performance critical SLB miss path.
    
    This patch removes the test, replacing it with a compile time switch.  It
    seems to make a measurable, although small speedup to the SLB miss path
    (maybe 0.5%).

    This patch also removes the cbar usage which is unnecessary. The MMCR is
    always available at 0xfffef000; there is no need to use the cbar register
    (if mmcr aliasing is enabled, then the MMCR is _also_ available at
    another address set by CBAR).

    Fixed nowayout behaviour so that it is consistent with other watchdog drivers
    Fixed release behaviour so that it is consistent with other watchdog drivers
    Added wdt_set_heartbeat function to set the timeout/heartbeat of the watchdog
    Made sure that memory remapping (wdtmrctl) is done before misc_register is started
    MMCR_BASE_DEFAULT was wrong (Bug 2497 reported by Sean Young)

    [PATCH] I2C: i2c-parport: support the ADM1031 evaluation board
    
    The following patch adds support for the ADM1030 and ADM1031 evaluation
    boards to the i2c-parport and i2c-parport-light drivers. They are almost
    compatible with the already supported ADM1025 and ADM1032 boards, except
    that the ADM1032 board needs some pins to be set high to draw its power,
    while the same pins power up heating resistors on the ADM1031 board. I
    considered it was a bit dangerous to do that by default, so I ended up
    with two different device definitions, one with powering pins set, and
    one with these pins cleared.

     In drivers/pci/probe.c::pci_scan_bridge() the call for pci_alloc_child_bus()

     The patch bellow fix that returning `max' if we got the NULL, but
    I do not know if it is right. I guess it is, because in that case
    the function will act in the same way as with `pass != 0'.

    This patch fixes throttling problems in the ftdi_sio driver for the
    2.6 kernel.  The old throttling mechanism (unlinking the read urb)
    often failed to work, and even it did work, would lose any data
    held in the transfer buffer.  The new mechanism presented here is
    based on what the whitehead driver does (defer processing and
    resubmitting of the read urb until unthrottled).

    [PATCH] Leave runtime suspended devices off at system resume
    
    Currently all devices are resumed at system resume time, including any
    that were individually powered off ("at runtime") prior to the system
    suspend.  In certain cases it can be nice to force back on individually
    suspended devices, such as the display, but hopefully this policy can be
    left up to userspace power managers; the kernel should probably honor
    the settings previously made by userspace/drivers.  This seems
    preferable to requiring a power-conscious system to re-suspend devices
    after a system resume; furthermore, for certain platforms (such as
    XScale PXA27X) there can be disastrous consequences of powering up
    devices when the system is in a state incompatible with operation of the
    device.
    
    Suggested patch does this:
    
    (1) At system resume, checks power_state to see if the device was
    suspended prior to system suspend, and skips powering on the device if
    so.
    
    (2) Does not re-suspend an already-suspended device at system suspend
    (using a different method than is currently employed, which reorders the

    (3) Preserves the active/off device list order despite the above changes
    to suspend/resume behavior, to avoid dependency problems that tend to
    occur when the list is reordered.

    [PATCH] Device runtime suspend/resume fixes
    
    (1) Set device power state at runtime resume (as is done for runtime
    suspend) so that a later suspend does not think the device is still
    suspended (refusing to suspend it again).
    
    (2) Move devices from the active list to the off list only when
    suspending all devices as part of a system suspend, not for runtime
    suspend.  This matches the resume code, which only moves devices from
    off to active during system resume, such that runtime resume currently
    doesn't move the suspended device back to the active list.  (This also
    avoids reordering the device list for runtime suspends; the list is in
    order of registration and suspend/resume works best that way -- granted,
    more sweeping improvements in how device dependencies are accounted for
    in the suspend/resume order are also needed someday.)
    
    Runtime device suspend/resume is in some cases used frequently on
    battery-powered embedded devices, to save additional power and to handle
    device power state interactions with overall system power state on
    certain platforms.

    [AGPGART] SIS AGP updates
    
    Signed-off-by: Dave Jones <davej@redhat.com>
    
    From: "Heilmann, Oliver" <Oliver.Heilmann@drkw.com>
    
    * renamed sis_648_enable to sis_delayed_enable and removed chipset
      references
    
    * All chipsets that require the sis delay-hack are listed in
      sis_broken_chipsets (and no other place).
    
    * There are two new module options to force agp3-spec compliant
      initialisation and/or the delay hack.  As I only have a 648FX chipset to
      test on, I figured this might be useful to experiment with on other
      chipsets (i.e.746[FX]).
    
    Basically, if you have an  SiS chipset and your machine freezes when you
    start X, try the -agp_sis_force_delay=1 option. If this fixes your
    problem add your PCI ID to sis_broken_chipsets in sis-agp.c
    Note to 746[FX] people: I'm still not sure what the differences between
    the two 746 versions and the 648 series are. If this patch does not work
    for you try playing with the agp_sis_agp_spec module option. Any
    feedback is greatly appreciated.

    [netdrvr ixgb] massive update
    
    Since Intel agreed to submit further updates via broken-up patches
    like they do currently (and admirably) for e1000 and e100, I agreed
    to merge this update to bring the driver up to speed.
    
    Contributed by: Ayyappan.Veeraiyan@intel.com
    
    Changes:
    
    Features implemented
    
    *	Support for new 850nm adapters.
    *	Copyright notice updated to include year 2004.
    *	Fix for "ixgb does not maintain non-default MTU setting across a
    link loss" issue - When link loss happens in non-default MTU
    environment, driver will incorrectly operate with default 1500 MTU
    setting.
    *	Netpoll support added
    *	Ethtool support - status functionality, FlowControl interface,
    Checksum interface, TSO and Scatter Gather interfaces
    *	Race condition fix - Race condition (TX path) exists between
    ixgb_xmit_frame and clean_tx_irq routines in handling the queue.
    * 	Removed dead code segments (#if 0)
    
    
    Performance improvement features
    *	Mod operator usage is removed - used to cause performance
    problems in non-IA architecture based machines
    *	Multiple ICR register read in ISR is avoided
    *	RS bit set on only 'end of packet' TX descriptors - to avoid
    multiple writebacks by controller for packets with multiple descriptors.
    *	RX descriptors prefetch is done - improved 1500 MTU TX
    performance
    
    
    All relevant e1000 driver cleanups ported to ixgb
    *	Valid error propagation in functions ixgb_up, ixgb_probe,
    ixgb_open.
    * 	NAPI code cleanups
    * 	u8, u16 and u32 data types are changed to uint8_t, uint16_t and
    uint32_t respectively. We use these types on our shared code for
    multiple OSes and also to make it uniform with e1000 driver.
    *	Some functions in ixgb_main.c are moved to different location -
    This enables easy porting of e1000 bug fixes to ixgb

    The following patch to net/sk98lin/skvpd.c was put together by Marc Bouget,

    This patch works around a corrupt EEPROM (VPD?) in the ASUS K8V Deluxe SE
    motherboard ethernet chipset and allows the network driver to work
    correctly.  We have written to ASUS and the sk98lin maintainers but have
    not heard anything back.

    [PATCH] pcnet32: avoid timeout with tcpdump
    
    This patch avoids a timeout when entering/exiting promiscuous mode with
    tcpdump.  All pending xmit operations are flushed and if the queue is
    full the timeout will occur.  The wake_queue avoids that timeout.
    Tested ppc64 and ia32.

    [PATCH] pcnet32: fix bogus carrier errors with 79c973
    
    The 79C973 version of the pcnet32 chipset would report all transmit
    operations as being sent with a carrier error.  The root cause was
    writing reserved bits in bcr33.  It caused the 973 to report xmit
    as errors, and caused 975 and 976 to hard hang when reading bcr34.
    
    My thanks to Bruce Penrod for his help in finding the cause of this
    bug.

    [PATCH] pcnet32: remove timer and complexity.
    
    This removes the timer I recently added, and the 'ltint' interrupt
    mitigation from the 79C971 and 79C972. It did not improve performance,
    added complexity, and was a bad idea in hind sight.

    [PATCH] Fix 8139too ring size for dreamcast/embedded
    
    Presently 2.6.6 backs out the CONFIG_8139_RXBUF_IDX in favor of using a
    hardcoded 8139_RXBUF_IDX (again). This seems to have been done due to
    some issues occuring with 8139_RXBUF_IDX =3D=3D 3, however (as the Kconfig
    pointed out), we still need 8139_RXBUF_IDX =3D=3D 1 in the CONFIG_SH_DREAMC=
    AST
    case.
    
    The patch which made this change can be seen at:
    
    {MIME-mangled URL}
    
    Before that, CONFIG_8139_RXBUF_IDX was set to 1 both in the
    CONFIG_SH_DREAMCAST and CONFIG_EMBEDDED cases. This patch adds that
    back into the current 8139too.

    [PATCH] ia64: don't udelay() in sn_mmiob
    
    sn_mmiob is a lightweight way to ensure PCI write ordering, intended
    to be used as an alternative to doing a PIO read. Unfortunately, with
    the udelay() in there, it ends up being slower than a PCI read on
    small configurations, so remove it in favor of a simple cpu_relax().

    [PATCH] nfsd: deleting symlinks over nfs causes oops on unmount
    
    From: "J. Bruce Fields" <bfields@fieldses.org>
    From: Neil Brown <neilb@cse.unsw.edu.au>
    
    This fixes an oops on unmount (failure of the assertation at
    fs/ext3/super.c:421).  Probably reproduceable just by creating and deleting a
    single symlink over nfs and then unmounting the exported filesystem.
    
    Recent change to fh_compose means dentry reference is *not* consumed, and so
    usually has to be explicitly dput afterwards.  One usage was missed in that
    patch, so this dput is needed.

    [PATCH] CPU Hotplug: restore Idle task's priority during CPU_DEAD notification
    
    From: Srivatsa Vaddagiri <vatsa@in.ibm.com>
    
    Fix a CPU Hotplug problem wherein idle task's "->prio" value is not
    restored to MAX_PRIO during CPU_DEAD handling.  Without this patch, once a
    CPU is offlined and then later onlined, it becomes "more or less" useless
    (does not run any task other than its idle task!)
    
    Ingo said:
    
      The __setscheduler() call is (technically) incorrect because in the
      SCHED_NORMAL case the prio should be zero.  So it's a bit cleaner to set up
      the static priority to MAX_PRIO and then revert the policy to SCHED_NORMAL
      via __setscheduler().

    [PATCH] Set d_bucket correctly for anonymous dentries
    
    From: Neil Brown <neilb@cse.unsw.edu.au>
    
    In researching the oopses reported in bug #2761, Neil came up with:
    
    I have found one problem, but it isn't particularly new and I cannot
     see how it would be related.
    
    When d_alloc_anon creates an anonymous dentry, it is put on a special hash
    chain for anonymous dentries (sb->s_anon), but d_bucket is set to
    
       d_hash(parent, name_hash)
    
    If, when it is eventually moved to a proper name, that hash value is the same
    as the final hash value, it will not be moved to the right bucket, and so it
    not be accessible by name.  This patch should fix it.
    
    
    
    anonymous dentries have their own private hash "bucket" (sb->s_anon) and so
    d_bucket should be set to a unique (impossible) address, else d_move will
    get confused.

    [PATCH] posix locks oops fix
    
    From: Andreas Gruenbacher <agruen@suse.de>
    
    There is a race between unshare_files() and the following steal_locks().
    As a consequence, steal_locks() may steal some additional FL_POSIX locks
    that don't belong to the current thread.  This triggers a BUG in
    locks_remove_flock().
    
    In detail, the current thread shares its files struct with other threads.
    This causes unshare_files() to associate the current thread with a copy of
    its files_struct.  The copy shares all file objects with the original files
    struct.  In the time between unshare_files() and steal_locks(), another
    thread creates a new file and a FL_POSIX lock on it.  The current thread
    gets into steal_locks() and takes over all FL_POSIX locks that refer to the
    previous files_struct, including the new lock.  We do
    put_files_struct(original files_struct).  This causes the file handle to
    the new file to be closed.  We get into locks_remove_posix() and miss the
    lock, because its fl_owner field now refers to the new files_struct.
    Finally we get into locks_remove_flock(), and stumble upon the lock.
    
    While looking into this bug report I gathered the following data with a
    SUSE kernel (oops and LKCD dump from Chris):

    Here's a proposed fix.  As a side effect, steal_locks no longer walks the
    global list of locks, but only the locks of all open inodes.
    
    What are the reasons (other than historic ones) for not getting rid of
    fl_owner and using fl_pid instead, by the way?  I think that would clean up
    the whole mess with file locks a bit.

    Take rename sem (where we can do it safely) when building full paths. We don't try to take the rename sem in cifs_rename of course because the kernel already took it above us, and for the same reason we can not take it in lookup/revalidate, but most everywhere else we build a full path we can safely take it.

    [PATCH] PCI: restore pci config space on resume
    
    The patch below enhances the PCI layer with 2 things
    1) enable and busmaster state are stored in the pci device struct
    2) pci config space is stored to the pci device struct
    
    with that, it is possible to make a generic pci resume method that restores
    config space and reenables the device, including busmaster when appropriate.
    
    One can rightfully argue that the driver resume method should do this, and
    yes that is right. So the patch only does it for devices that don't have a
    resume method. Like the main PCI bridge on my testbox of which the bios so
    nicely forgets to restore the bus master bit during resume.. With this patch
    my testbox resumes just fine while it, well, wasn't all too happy as you can
    imagine without a busmaster pci bridge.

    Split ptep_establish into "establish" and "update_access_flags"
    
    ptep_establish() is used to establish a new mapping at COW time,
    and it always replaces a non-writable page mapping with a totally
    new page mapping that is dirty (and likely writable, although ptrace
    may cause a non-writable new mapping). Because it was nonwritable,
    we don't have to worry about losing concurrent dirty page bit updates.
    
    ptep_update_access_flags() leaves the same page mapping, but updates
    the accessed/dirty/writable bits (it only ever sets them, and never
    removes any permissions). Often easier, but it may race with a dirty
    bit update on another CPU.
    
    Booted on x86 and ppc64.

    [IPSEC]: Fix buglet in AF_KEY spddelete
    
    When trying to spddelete individual entries using setkey, spddelete always
    fails.  The culprit is in net/af_key.c; spdadd sets the family field of the
    selector when creating an entry, but spddelete doesn't when building a
    selector to match for xfrm_policy_bysel.  Trivial fix is to have spddelete
    set the family field in the selector in same way spdadd does.

    race in updating accessed bits and dropping a concurrent dirty
    bit.

    [PATCH] USB: Gonzo variable renaming in hub.c
    
    As part of the cleanup effort, I wanted to name all the variables in hub.c
    uniformly.  Currently there are different names for the same thing in
    different routines, and the same names are used for different things --
    it's impossible to keep things straight.  I also wanted to step away from
    the deplorable practice of naming everything "dev".  It is not an
    exaggeration that up until relatively recently one of the drivers (not the
    hub driver, fortunately!) contained a line which looked basically like
    this:
    
    	dev->dev.dev = &intf->dev;
    
    If you can make sense out of that, you're a better code reader than I am!
    
    Ranting aside, this patch institutes the following name scheme for local
    variables in hub.c:
    
    	hub:		struct usb_hub
    	hdev:		hub's corresponding struct usb_device
    	hub_dev:	hub interface's embedded struct device
    	udev:		general struct usb_device
    
    There are a couple of genuine code changes hidden in there too.  Just
    trivial things, like creating a local hub_dev variable for use in place of
    &hub->intf->dev.

    [PATCH] USB: Make usb_choose_configuration() a separate subroutine
    
    This patch creates a separate subroutine to encapsulate the work required
    in choosing an initial configuration for a device.  In my opinion that
    reflects a policy decision that should be kept apart from all the other
    work involved in creating a new device structure.  The existing code in
    usb_new_device() is simply moved into usb_choose_configuration().

    renames it to hub_set_address().

    [PATCH] USB: Change "driverfs" to "sysfs" in usbcore
    
    Before fixing up the device locking and device reset code, I want to do
    some cleanups of the hub driver and related areas.  This is the first of a
    series of patches for that purpose.
    
    This patch changes all the occurrences of "driverfs" in usbcore to "sysfs"
    -- I just couldn't stand seeing the out-of-date name any more (and I kept
    confusing it with usbfs, don't know why).
    
    Although I did a "bk mv driverfs.c sysfs.c" when creating the patch, the
    exported patch file itself doesn't reflect that very well.  It looks like
    driverfs.c was deleted and sysfs.c created from scratch.  If you prefer, I
    can resubmit this in a slightly different form, with the file name
    unchanged so that you can issue the "bk mv" command in your repository
    after applying the patch.

    [PATCH] USB UHCI: allow URBs to be unlinked when IRQs don't work
    
    A lot of people with USB controllers made by VIA have been suffering from
    the fact that these controllers stop working when they receive a babble
    packet.  In particular, they stop generating interrupt requests.  Since
    the UHCI driver relies on IRQs from the controller for proper timing and
    interlocking of unlink requests, this means that those broken controllers
    will hang the UHCI driver and drivers for any device connected through it.
    
    This patch, written by Herbert Xu, gives the UCHI driver the ability to
    manage the unlink procedure using timer interrupts as well as controller
    interrupts.  (It also fixes a race in the UHCI irq handler.)  Although it
    won't prevent the VIA controllers from flaking out when they encounter
    babble, at least now users will be able to rmmod the uhci-hcd driver and
    then reload it, restoring their systems back to normal operation (until
    the next babble!).
    
    P.S.: Herbert, there's one loose end I still want to tie up.  When the
    controller isn't running (i.e., is suspended) the frame number won't
    change, but unlinks still need to work.  It's a small point, not too
    likely to come up in normal usage.  I'll fix it later on when I update the
    state-changing part of the driver.

    [PATCH] USB: Initially read 9 bytes of config descriptor
    
    This patch reads the full 9 bytes of a configuration descriptor during
    enumeration rather than just the first 8 bytes.  That's how Windows does
    it, and today I ran across a device that doesn't work properly when asked
    to send only 8 bytes worth.  I doubt very much this will cause any
    problems with currently-working devices; since the descriptor itself is 9
    bytes long and since the devices are most likely to expect a 9-byte
    request, anything that can handle an 8-byte request should have no
    difficulty.  (Also, some debugging messages have been slightly improved.)
    
    Incidentally, USB traces taken from Windows 2000 and Windows XP show that
    when those operating systems retrieve a string descriptor during
    enumeration, they do so by requesting a 255-byte transfer.  They do not
    first ask just for the initial 2 bytes (which contain the actual length)
    and then ask for the actual length, which is what we do.  Interestingly,
    back in 2.4 we _did_ do things the same as Windows.

    hiddev_table[] is an array of pointers.  the minor number is used as an

    hiddev_table array.

    [PATCH] IRQ stacks for PPC64
    
    Even with a 16kB stack, we have been seeing stack overflows on PPC64
    under stress.  This patch implements separate per-cpu stacks for
    processing interrupts and softirqs, along the lines of the
    CONFIG_4KSTACKS stuff on x86.  At the moment the stacks are still 16kB
    but I hope we can reduce that to 8kB in future.  (Gcc is capable of
    adding instructions to the function prolog to check the stack pointer
    whenever it moves it downwards, and I want to use that when I try
    using 8kB stacks so I can be confident that we aren't overflowing the
    stack.)

    It seems eccentric to implement MAP_POPULATE only on PROT_NONE mappings:
    do_mmap_pgoff is passing down prot, then sys_remap_file_pages verifies it's
    not set.  I guess that's an oversight from when we realized that the prot arg
    to sys_remap_file_pages was misdesigned.
    
    There's another oddity whose heritage is harder for me to understand, so
    please let me leave it to you: sys_remap_file_pages is declared as asmlinkage
    in mm/fremap.c, but is the one syscall declared without asmlinkage in

    From: Jeff Mahoney <jeffm@suse.com>
    
    The following is a patch to fix a locking problem in ACL/xattr code. It
    manifests when a user attempts to set an xattr on a file which they do
    not own, and on which an ACL is applied.
    
    What happens is this:
    reiserfs_setxattr [write lock inode xattr sem]
      ->xattr_set
        -> lookup
           -> __reiserfs_permission [if conditions above are met, and need_lock=
     is
              unset, read lock inode xattr sem] *lockup*
    
    Since we already keep track of when to lock during permission calls, the
    fix is simple: just make the locking conditional as it was before.

    [PATCH] UDF: directory reading fix
    
    From: Ben Fennema <bfennema@falcon.csc.calpoly.edu>
    
    The problem occured when files were stored on the disc in 16-bit per
    character mode when all the upper bits were 0.  The fs module
    converted the file name given by the user to a 8-bit per character
    string to compare, so the comparison always failed.
    
    The patch maps the file from disc into the current locale and then
    compares it directly to the file name given by the user.

    [PATCH] v4l: use saa7111 i2c module in V4L MXB driver
    
    From: Michael Hunold <hunold@convergence.de>
    
    The attached patch changes my "Multimedia eXtension Board" (MXB)
    Video4Linux-driver to use the standard saa7111 video decoder infrastructure
    (to which I recently submitted changes through Ronald Bultje) instead of
    some home-brewn direct-access stuff.
    
    Nothing serious, but it removes code duplication and makes the code use the
    video decoder api.

    [PATCH] initramfs uncpio fix
    
    From: <viro@parcelfarce.linux.theplanet.co.uk>
    
    init/initramfs.c::do_skip() has an off-by-one that leads to unpacking
    failures for some gzipped cpio images.  We have
    
    static int __init do_skip(void)
    {
            if (this_header + count <= next_header) {
                    eat(count);
                    return 1;
            } else {
                    eat(next_header - this_header);
                    state = next_state;
                    return 0;
            }
    }
    
    and that <= should actually be <.  It almost never matters, since if we hit
    the boundary case (header ending exactly on the gunzip window end) the
    current variant will simply end up doing extra call of do_skip() when we
    get to the next window and that will finish the work (assign state).  The
    only exception is when we hit that in the last window.  That is, if there's
    nothing after the final header (trailer).  Then we miss the final state
    transition (Skip -> Reset) and get "junk in archive" panic.  Normally
    cpio(1) pads the image to multiple of 512, so we actually have a bunch of
    zeroes after the trailer.  And that almost always saves our butts - trailer
    is followed by zeroes, so we get to Reset state just fine.
    
    So we never see that on small in-kernel image (it's less than 512 bytes, so
    it gets a lot of padding) and we almost never see that on external ones
    (1:127 odds of hitting the bug).

    [PATCH] matroxfb: Add support for mapping CRTC<->outputs at boot time
    
    Signed-off-by: Petr Vandrovec <vandrove@vc.cvut.cz>
    
    Some people expressed interest in having possibility to set CRTC <->
    outputs mapping at boot time, without having to use 'matroxset' later after
    kernel boots.
    
    This patch adds option 'video=matroxfb:outputs:XYZ', where X sets which
    CRTC will connect to primary output, Y sets secondary output and Z sets DVI
    output.
    
    In addition to that I also added missing memset() into maven, which was
    broken since i2c was kobjectified.

    [PATCH] Fix race condition with current->group_info
    
    From: Olaf Kirch <okir@suse.de>
    
    I have been chasing a corruption of current->group_info on PPC during NFS
    stress tests.  The problem seems to be that nfsd is messing with its
    group_info quite a bit, while some monitoring processes look at
    /proc/<pid>/status and do a get_group_info/put_group_info without any locking.
    
    This problem can be reproduced on ppc platforms within a few seconds if you
    generate some NFS load and do a "cat /proc/XXX/status" of an nfsd thread in a
    tight loop.
    
    I therefore think changes to current->group_info, and querying it from a
    different process, needs to be protected using the task_lock.
    
    (akpm: task->group_info here is safe against exit() because the task holds a
    ref on group_info which is released in __put_task_struct, and the /proc file
    has a ref on the task_struct).

    [PATCH] Fix the mangled-oops-output-on-SMP problem
    
    From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
    
    printk currently does
    
    	if (oops_in_progres)
    		bust_printk_locks();
    
    which means that once we oops, the printk locking is 100% ineffective and
    multiple CPUs make an unreadable mess on a serial console.  It's a significant
    development hassle.
    
    Fix that up by only popping locks once per ten seconds.
    
    akpm@osdl.org did:
    
      - Bump the timeout to 30 seconds - 9600 baud is slow.
    
      - Handle jiffy wraps: change the logic so that we only skip the lockbust
        if the current time is within 30 seconds of the previous lockbusting
        attempt.

    [PATCH] Prevent scary warnings from knfsd
    
    From: "J. Bruce Fields" <bfields@fieldses.org>
    
    The kernel currently prints:
    
     nfsd: nobody listening for auth.unix.ip upcall; has some daemon not been started?
    
    on every bootup, during initscripts.
    
    Neil Brown <neilb@cse.unsw.edu.au> says:
    
      It was part of the recent set of idmapper patches.  Bruce wanted the admin
      to get a warning when the idmapper daemon wasn't running.  I thought the
      same warning should apply to any daemon that responded to upcalls.
    
      In the case of auth.unix.ip it isn't strictly necessary for a daemon to be
      running (for comparability with 2.4).
    
      You can get rid of the warning by doing:
    
        mount -t nfsd nfsd /proc/fs/nfs
    
      before mountd is started (init scripts should start doing this I hope, but
      distributions don't tend to use the init script from nfs-utils, so it is
      hard to push it).  This will trigger mountd to listen on auth.unix.ip and
      others.
    
    
    That's a hassle, so Bruce's patch limits the warning purely to the new
    idmapper cache.  It provides a callback in the cache_detail that individual
    caches can use to log messages when upcalls fail because a userspace daemon
    not running.  Implement this method for the idmapping caches.

    [PATCH] ppc64: avoid bogus real IRQ numbers
    
    Signed-off-by: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>
    
    Early in the boot process on pSeries machines, we look in the Open Firmware
    device tree for information about the interrupt assignments, and assign
    virtual IRQ numbers for each physical IRQ.  There is currently a couple of
    bugs in this code which result in us assigning virtual IRQs for nonexistent
    physical IRQs.  This causes problems when we call the firmware to enable or
    disable those nonexistent physical IRQs.  Some versions at least of the
    firmware will hit an assertion failure and crash the machine when this
    happens.
    
    This patch fixes the bugs and ensures that we don't try and use nonexistent
    physical IRQ numbers.  One bug was that we were mapping ISA interrupts,
    which is unnecessary since virtual IRQ numbers 0 - 15 are reserved for
    them.  The other was that when we had a PCI interrupt (which is always in
    the range 1 to 4, corresponding to INTA to INTD) which didn't have a
    mapping in the PCI host bridge above it, we were just using the original
    number (usually 1) rather than ignoring it.

    [PATCH] ppc64: bump IOMMU_MAX_ORDER
    
    Signed-off-by: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>
    
    We have cards that want over 2MB of PCI consistent memory.  The
    IOMAP_MAX_ORDER limit is just to catch bad drivers early, so we can bump
    this a bit.
    
    We want some room to grow but our maximum get_free_pages allocation on
    ppc64 is currently 16MB, so it doesnt make sense to go above that.

    [PATCH] dynamic addition of virtual disks on PPC64 iSeries
    
    From: Stephen Rothwell <sfr@canb.auug.org.au>
    
    This patch allows us to dynamically add virtual disks to an iSeries partition.
     It works like this: after you have created the virtual disk file on OS/400
    and attached it to the Linux partition, you need to write to
    /sys/bus/vio/drivers/viodasd/probe (it doesn't matter what you write).  This
    will do the probe.  It calls add_disk() for each new disk, so we get hotplug
    events as a side effect.
    
    This was the nicest way I could think of doing this as the interface to the
    hypervisor is polled ...

    From: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>
    
    From: Anton Blanchard, Dave Hansen and Olof Johansson:
    
    Fix multiple bugs in the ppc64 NUMA topology probe code.
    
    - We were using HW cpu numbers instead of logical ones.  615, 630, 650,
      some 670 and some 690 SMP will all fail to boot without this patch.
    
    - The old code would BUG() when it got confused (more NUMA zones than the
      kernel is configured for etc).
    
    - The common depth calculation was incorrect.  Dave found an OF property
      that gives us exactly what we want.
    
    - Things were broken on SMT machines.
    
    The new code should work on those broken systems and should no longer BUG()
    but fall back to a flat topology when it gets confused.

    On any x86 without cpuid, early_cpu_detect() left x86_cache_alignment as

    [CPUFREQ] Quieten the powernow-k7 init printk a little.
    There seem to be quite a few desktop K7 processors which support the

    In which case the driver prints out
    "PowerNOW! Technology present. Can scale: nothing" which looks a bit odd,
    and just adds to confusion of end-users.
    Change things so that we don't print anything at all if we can't do anything.
    
    Also kill some trailing whitespace gremlins that crept in.

    [PATCH] ppc64: better stack traces
    
    This improves the stack traces we get on PPC64 by putting a marker in
    those stack frames that are created as a result of an interrupt or
    exception.  The marker is "regshere" (0x7265677368657265).
    
    With this, stack traces show where exceptions have occurred, which can
    be very useful.  This also improves the accuracy of the trace because
    the relevant return address can be in the link register at the time of
    the exception rather than on the stack.  We now print the PC and
    exception type for each exception frame, and then the link register if
    appropriate as the next item in the trace.

    [PATCH] USB: /usb/gadget/serial.c warning fix.
    
     that code is generating the fallowing warning:
    
    drivers/usb/gadget/serial.c:162: warning: `debug' defined but not used
    
     When G_SERIAL_DEBUG is not defined, `debug' is not used, because
    the gs_debug() function is compiled only when G_SERIAL_DEBUG is
    defined.
    
     Thus, a solution is to define `debug' only when G_SERIAL_DEBUG
    is defined. That includes the use of `debug' as a module parameter
    (this last part I'm not sure).
    
     The patch bellow does that (compiles ok, not tested because I don't
    have that hardware):

    [IPSEC]: Fix OOPS when deleting an ip address.
    
    Looks like I was too hasty in blaming myself :) Although my patch does
    fix a real bug, it cannot have been responsible for the crash that the OP
    reported.  The reason is that the state timer always keeps a reference to
    the state so even if it is incorrectly re-added the reference will prevent
    the crash.
    
    Hence the problem is still a bug in the ref counting.  I think I've found
    the real culprit now.  __xfrm?_find_acq() is missing an xfrm_state_hold
    on the create path.  This also explains why I never see it myself since
    Openswan never creates states through that code-path.

    Any architecture (like pa-risc) that makes use of the helper function
    flush_dcache_mmap_lock() won't compile with the new rmap due to use of
    the wrong "mapping".
    
    Trivial fix.

    [ARM] Remove SA1111 PS/2 IRQ_HANDLED handling.
    
    Some SA1111 devices are unable to clear the PS/2 receive IRQ before
    it has been serviced, so we always re-enter the handler one more
    time than is strictly necessary.  We can't clear the IRQ after
    servicing because that causes race conditions with other SA1111
    devices, so we take the easy option and always return IRQ_HANDLED.

    [PATCH] bogus sigaltstack calls by rt_sigreturn
    
    There is a longstanding bug in the rt_sigreturn system call.
    This exists in both 2.4 and 2.6, and for almost every platform.
    
    I am referring to this code in sys_rt_sigreturn (arch/i386/kernel/signal.c):
    
    	if (__copy_from_user(&st, &frame->uc.uc_stack, sizeof(st)))
    		goto badframe;
    	/* It is more difficult to avoid calling this function than to
    	   call it and ignore errors.  */
    	/*
    	 * THIS CANNOT WORK! "&st" is a kernel address, and "do_sigaltstack()"
    	 * takes a user address (and verifies that it is a user address). End
    	 * result: it does exactly _nothing_.
    	 */
    	do_sigaltstack(&st, NULL, regs->esp);
    
    As the comment says, this is bogus.  On vanilla i386 kernels, this is just
    harmlessly stupid--do_sigaltstack always does nothing and returns -EFAULT.
    
    However this code actually bites users on kernels using Ingo Molnar's 4G/4G
    address space layout changes.  There some kernel stack address might very
    well be a lovely and readable user address as well.  When that happens, we
    make a sigaltstack call with some random buffer, and then the fun begins.
    
    To my knowledge, this has produced trouble in the real world only for 4G
    i386 kernels (RHEL and Fedora "hugemem" kernels) on machines that actually
    have several GB of physical memory (and in programs that are actually using
    sigaltstack and handling a lot of signals).  However, the same clearly
    broken code has been blindly copied to most other architecture ports, and
    off hand I don't know the address space details of any other well enough to
    know if real kernel stack addresses and real user addresses are in fact
    disjoint as they are on i386 when not using the nonstandard 4GB address
    space layout.
    
    The obvious intent of the call being there in the first place is to permit
    a signal handler to diddle its ucontext_t.uc_stack before returning, and
    have this effect a sigaltstack call on the signal handler return.  This is
    not only an optimization vs doing the extra system call, but makes it
    possible to make a sigaltstack change when that handler itself was running
    on the signal stack.  AFAICT this has never actually worked before, so
    certainly noone depends on it.  But the code certainly suggests that
    someone intended at one time for that to be the behavior.  Thus I am
    inclined to fix it so it works in that way, though it has not done so before.
    It would also be reasonable enough to simply rip out the bogus call and not
    have this functionality.
    
    From the current state of code in both 2.4 and 2.6, there is no fathoming
    how this broken code came about.  It's actually much simpler to just make
    it work!  I can only presume that at some point in the past the sigaltstack
    implementation functions were different such that this made sense.  Of the
    few ports I've looked at briefly, only the ppc/pc64 porters (go paulus!)
    actually tried to understand what the i386 code was doing and implemented
    it correctly rather than just carefully transliterating the bug.
    
    The patch below fixes only the i386 and x86_64 versions.  The x86_64
    patches I have not actually tested.  I think each and every arch (except
    ppc and ppc64) need to make the corresponding fixes as well.  Note that
    there is a function to fix for each native arch, and then one for each
    emulation flavor.  The details differ minutely for getting the calls right
    in each emulation flavor, but I think that most or all of the arch's with
    biarch/emulation support have similar enough code that each emulation
    flavor's fix will look very much like the arch/x86_64/ia32/ia32_signal.c
    patch here.

    [PATCH] partial prefetch for vma_prio_tree_next
    
    From: Rajesh Venkatasubramanian <vrajesh@umich.edu>
    
    This patch adds prefetches for walking a vm_set.list.  Adding prefetches
    for prio tree traversals is tricky and may lead to cache trashing.  So this
    patch just adds prefetches only when walking a vm_set.list.
    
    I haven't done any benchmarks to show that this patch improves performance.
     However, this patch should help to improve performance when vm_set.lists
    are long, e.g., libc.  Since we only prefetch vmas that are guaranteed to
    be used in the near future, this patch should not result in cache trashing,
    theoretically.
    
    I didn't add any NULL checks before prefetching because prefetch.h clearly
    says prefetch(0) is okay.

    [PATCH] rmap 40 better anon_vma sharing
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    anon_vma rmap will always necessarily be more restrictive about vma merging
    than before: according to the history of the vmas in an mm, they are liable to
    be allocated different anon_vma heads, and from that point on be unmergeable.
    
    Most of the time this doesn't matter at all; but in two cases it may matter.
    One case is that mremap refuses (-EFAULT) to span more than a single vma: so
    it is conceivable that some app has relied on vma merging prior to mremap in
    the past, and will now fail with anon_vma.  Conceivable but unlikely, let's
    cross that bridge if we come to it: and the right answer would be to extend
    mremap, which should not be exporting the kernel's implementation detail of
    vma to user interface.
    
    The other case that matters is when a reasonable repetitive sequence of
    syscalls and faults ends up with a large number of separate unmergeable vmas,
    instead of the single merged vma it could have.
    
    Andrea's mprotect-vma-merging patch fixed some such instances, but left other
    plausible cases unmerged.  There is no perfect solution, and the harder you
    try to allow vmas to be merged, the less efficient anon_vma becomes, in the
    extreme there being one to span the whole address space, from which hangs
    every private vma; but anonmm rmap is clearly superior to that extreme.
    
    Andrea's principle was that neighbouring vmas which could be mprotected into
    mergeable vmas should be allowed to share anon_vma: good insight.  His
    implementation was to arrange this sharing when trying vma merge, but that
    seems to be too early.  This patch sticks to the principle, but implements it
    in anon_vma_prepare, when handling the first write fault on a private vma:
    with better results.  The drawback is that this first write fault needs an
    extra find_vma_prev (whereas prev was already to hand when implementing
    anon_vma sharing at try-to-merge time).

    [PATCH] rmap 39 add anon_vma rmap
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    Andrea Arcangeli's anon_vma object-based reverse mapping scheme for anonymous
    pages.  Instead of tracking anonymous pages by pte_chains or by mm, this
    tracks them by vma.  But because vmas are frequently split and merged
    (particularly by mprotect), a page cannot point directly to its vma(s), but
    instead to an anon_vma list of those vmas likely to contain the page - a list
    on which vmas can easily be linked and unlinked as they come and go.  The vmas
    on one list are all related, either by forking or by splitting.
    
    This has three particular advantages over anonmm: that it can cope
    effortlessly with mremap moves; and no longer needs page_table_lock to protect
    an mm's vma tree, since try_to_unmap finds vmas via page -> anon_vma -> vma
    instead of using find_vma; and should use less cpu for swapout since it can
    locate its anonymous vmas more quickly.
    
    It does have disadvantages too: a lot more change in mmap.c to deal with
    anon_vmas, though small straightforward additions now that the vma merging has
    been refactored there; more lowmem needed for each anon_vma and vma structure;
    an additional restriction on the merging of vmas (cannot be merged if already
    assigned different anon_vmas, since then their pages will be pointing to
    different heads).
    
    (There would be no need to enlarge the vma structure if anonymous pages
    belonged only to anonymous vmas; but private file mappings accumulate
    anonymous pages by copy-on-write, so need to be listed in both anon_vma and
    prio_tree at the same time.  A different implementation could avoid that by
    using anon_vmas only for purely anonymous vmas, and use the existing prio_tree
    to locate cow pages - but that would involve a long search for each single
    private copy, probably not a good idea.)
    
    Where before the vm_pgoff of a purely anonymous (not file-backed) vma was
    meaningless, now it represents the virtual start address at which that vma is
    mapped - which the standard file pgoff manipulations treat linearly as vmas
    are split and merged.  But if mremap moves the vma, then it generally carries
    its original vm_pgoff to the new location, so pages shared with the old
    location can still be found.  Magic.
    
    Hugh has massaged it somewhat: building on the earlier rmap patches, this
    patch is a fifth of the size of Andrea's original anon_vma patch.  Please note
    that this posting will be his first sight of this patch, which he may or may
    not approve.

    [PATCH] rmap 38 remove anonmm rmap
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    Before moving on to anon_vma rmap, remove now what's peculiar to anonmm rmap:
    the anonmm handling and the mremap move cows.  Temporarily reduce
    page_referenced_anon and try_to_unmap_anon to stubs, so a kernel built with
    this patch will not swap anonymous at all.

    [PATCH] rmap 37 page_add_anon_rmap vma
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    Silly final patch for anonmm rmap: change page_add_anon_rmap's mm arg to vma
    arg like anon_vma rmap, to smooth the transition between them.

    [PATCH] rmap 36 mprotect use vma_merge
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    Earlier on, in 2.6.6, we took the vma merging code out of mremap.c and let it
    rely on vma_merge instead (via copy_vma).  Now take the vma merging code out
    of mprotect.c and let it rely on vma_merge too: so vma_merge becomes the sole
    vma merging engine.  The fruit of this consolidation is that mprotect now
    merges file-backed vmas naturally.  Make this change now because anon_vma will
    complicate the vma merging rules, let's keep them all in one place.
    
    vma_merge remains where the decisions are made, whether to merge with prev
    and/or next; but now [addr,end) may be the latter part of prev, or first part
    or whole of next, whereas before it was always a new area.
    
    vma_adjust carries out vma_merge's decision, but when sliding the boundary
    between vma and next, must temporarily remove next from the prio_tree too.
    And it turned out (by oops) to have a surer idea of whether next needs to be
    removed than vma_merge, so the fput and freeing moves into vma_adjust.
    
    Too much decipherment of what's going on at the start of vma_adjust?  Yes, and
    there's a delicate assumption that you may use vma_adjust in sliding a
    boundary, or splitting in two, or growing a vma (mremap uses it in that way),
    but not for simply shrinking a vma.  Which is so, and must be so (how could
    pages mapped in the part to go, be zapped without first splitting?), but would
    feel better with some protection.
    
    __vma_unlink can then be moved from mm.h to mmap.c, and mm.h's more misleading
    than helpful can_vma_merge is deleted.

    [PATCH] rmap 35 mmap.c cleanups
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    Before some real vma_merge work in mmap.c in the next patch, a patch of
    miscellaneous cleanups to cut down the noise:
    
    - remove rb_parent arg from vma_merge: mm->mmap can do that case
    - scatter pgoff_t around to ingratiate myself with the boss
    - reorder is_mergeable_vma tests, vm_ops->close is least likely
    - can_vma_merge_before take combined pgoff+pglen arg (from Andrea)
    - rearrange do_mmap_pgoff's ever-confusing anonymous flags switch
    - comment do_mmap_pgoff's mysterious (vm_flags & VM_SHARED) test
    - fix ISO C90 warning on browse_rb if building with DEBUG_MM_RB
    - stop that long MNT_NOEXEC line wrapping
    
    Yes, buried in amidst these is indeed one pgoff replaced by "next->vm_pgoff -
    pglen" (reverting a mod of mine which took pgoff supplied by user too
    seriously in the anon case), and another pgoff replaced by 0 (reverting
    anon_vma mod which crept in with NUMA API): neither of them really matters,
    except perhaps in /proc/pid/maps.

    [PATCH] rmap 34 vm_flags page_table_lock
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    First of a batch of seven rmap patches, based on 2.6.6-mm3.  Probably the
    final batch: remaining issues outstanding can have isolated patches.  The
    first half of the batch is good for anonmm or anon_vma, the second half of the
    batch replaces my anonmm rmap by Andrea's anon_vma rmap.
    
    Judge for yourselves which you prefer.  I do think I was wrong to call
    anon_vma more complex than anonmm (its lists are easier to understand than my
    refcounting), and I'm happy with its vma merging after the last patch.  It
    just comes down to whether we can spare the extra 24 bytes (maximum, on
    32-bit) per vma for its advantages in swapout and mremap.
    
    rmap 34 vm_flags page_table_lock
    
    Why do we guard vm_flags mods with page_table_lock when it's already
    down_write guarded by mmap_sem?  There's probably a historical reason, but no
    sign of any need for it now.  Andrea added a comment and removed the instance
    from mprotect.c, Hugh plagiarized his comment and removed the instances from
    madvise.c and mlock.c.  Huge leap in scalability...  not expected; but this
    should stop people asking why those spinlocks.

    [PATCH] rmap 33 install_arg_page vma
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    anon_vma will need to pass vma to put_dirty_page, so change it and its
    various callers (setup_arg_pages and its 32-on-64-bit arch variants); and
    please, let's rename it to install_arg_page.
    
    Earlier attempt to do this (rmap 26 __setup_arg_pages) tried to clean up
    those callers instead, but failed to boot: so now apply rmap 27's memset
    initialization of vmas to these callers too; which relieves them from
    needing the recently included linux/mempolicy.h.
    
    While there, moved install_arg_page's flush_dcache_page up before
    page_table_lock - doesn't in fact matter at all, just saves one worry when
    researching flush_dcache_page locking constraints.

    [PATCH] rmap 27 memset 0 vma
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    We're NULLifying more and more fields when initializing a vma
    (mpol_set_vma_default does that too, if configured to do anything).  Now use
    memset to avoid specifying fields, and save a little code too.
    
    (Yes, I realize anon_vma will want to set vm_pgoff non-0, but I think that
    will be better handled at the core, since anon vm_pgoff is negotiable up until
    an anon_vma is actually assigned.)

    Remove fastcall directives from rmap.  And fix comment about mremap_moved
    race: it only applies to anon pages.

    [PATCH] rmap 23 empty flush_dcache_mmap_lock
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    Most architectures (like i386) do nothing in flush_dcache_page, or don't scan
    i_mmap in flush_dcache_page, so don't need flush_dcache_mmap_lock to do
    anything: define it and flush_dcache_mmap_unlock away.  Noticed arm26, cris,
    h8300 still defining flush_page_to_ram: delete it again.

    [PATCH] rmap 22 flush_dcache_mmap_lock
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    arm and parisc __flush_dcache_page have been scanning the i_mmap(_shared) list
    without locking or disabling preemption.  That may be even more unsafe now
    it's a prio tree instead of a list.
    
    It looks like we cannot use i_shared_lock for this protection: most uses of
    flush_dcache_page are okay, and only one would need lock ordering fixed
    (get_user_pages holds page_table_lock across flush_dcache_page); but there's a
    few (e.g.  in net and ntfs) which look as if they're using it in I/O
    completion - and it would be restrictive to disallow it there.
    
    So, on arm and parisc only, define flush_dcache_mmap_lock(mapping) as
    spin_lock_irq(&(mapping)->tree_lock); on i386 (and other arches left to the
    next patch) define it away to nothing; and use where needed.
    
    While updating locking hierarchy in filemap.c, remove two layers of the fossil
    record from add_to_page_cache comment: no longer used for swap.
    
    I believe all the #includes will work out, but have only built i386.  I can
    see several things about this patch which might cause revulsion: the name
    flush_dcache_mmap_lock?  the reuse of the page radix_tree's tree_lock for this
    different purpose?  spin_lock_irqsave instead?  can't we somehow get
    i_shared_lock to handle the problem?

    Why should try_to_unmap_anon and try_to_unmap_file take a copy of
    page->mapcount and pass it down for try_to_unmap_one to decrement?  why not

    reason, but not any more: remove the mapcount arg.

    [PATCH] rmap 20 i_mmap_shared into i_mmap
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    Why should struct address_space have separate i_mmap and i_mmap_shared
    prio_trees (separating !VM_SHARED and VM_SHARED vmas)?  No good reason, the
    same processing is usually needed on both.  Merge i_mmap_shared into i_mmap,
    but keep i_mmap_writable count of VM_SHARED vmas (those capable of dirtying
    the underlying file) for the mapping_writably_mapped test.
    
    The VM_MAYSHARE test in the arm and parisc loops is not necessarily what they
    will want to use in the end: it's provided as a harmless example of what might
    be appropriate, but maintainers are likely to revise it later (that parisc
    loop is currently being changed in the parisc tree anyway).
    
    On the way, remove the now out-of-date comments on vm_area_struct size.

    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    The previous patches of this prio_tree batch have been to generic only.  Now
    the arm and parisc __flush_dcache_page are converted to using
    vma_prio_tree_next, and benefit from its selection of relevant vmas.  They're
    still accessing the tree without i_shared_lock or any other, that's not
    forgotten but still under investigation.  Include pagemap.h for the definition
    of PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT.  s390 and x86_64 no longer initialize vma's shared field
    (whose type has changed), done later.

    [PATCH] rmap 18: i_mmap_nonlinear
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    The prio_tree is of no use to nonlinear vmas: currently we're having to search
    the tree in the most inefficient way to find all its nonlinears.  At the very
    least we need an indication of the unlikely case when there are some
    nonlinears; but really, we'd do best to take them out of the prio_tree
    altogether, into a list of their own - i_mmap_nonlinear.

    [PATCH] rmap 17: real prio_tree
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    Rajesh Venkatasubramanian's implementation of a radix priority search tree of
    vmas, to handle object-based reverse mapping corner cases well.
    
    Amongst the objections to object-based rmap were test cases by akpm and by
    mingo, in which large numbers of vmas mapping disjoint or overlapping parts of
    a file showed strikingly poor performance of the i_mmap lists.  Perhaps those
    tests are irrelevant in the real world?  We cannot be too sure: the prio_tree
    is well-suited to solving precisely that problem, so unless it turns out to
    bring too much overhead, let's include it.
    
    Why is this prio_tree.c placed in mm rather than lib?  See GET_INDEX: this
    implementation is geared throughout to use with vmas, though the first half of
    the file appears more general than the second half.
    
    Each node of the prio_tree is itself (contained within) a vma: might save
    memory by allocating distinct nodes from which to hang vmas, but wouldn't save
    much, and would complicate the usage with preallocations.  Off each node of
    the prio_tree itself hangs a list of like vmas, if any.
    
    The connection from node to list is a little awkward, but probably the best
    compromise: it would be more straightforward to list likes directly from the
    tree node, but that would use more memory per vma, for the list_head and to
    identify that head.  Instead, node's shared.vm_set.head points to next vma
    (whose shared.vm_set.head points back to node vma), and that next contains the
    list_head from which the rest hang - reusing fields already used in the
    prio_tree node itself.
    
    Currently lacks prefetch: Rajesh hopes to add some soon.

    [PATCH] rmap 16: pretend prio_tree
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    Pave the way for prio_tree by switching over to its interfaces, but actually
    still implement them with the same old lists as before.
    
    Most of the vma_prio_tree interfaces are straightforward.  The interesting one
    is vma_prio_tree_next, used to search the tree for all vmas which overlap the
    given range: unlike the list_for_each_entry it replaces, it does not find
    every vma, just those that match.
    
    But this does leave handling of nonlinear vmas in a very unsatisfactory state:
    for now we have to search again over the maximum range to find all the
    nonlinear vmas which might contain a page, which of course takes away the
    point of the tree.  Fixed in later patch of this batch.
    
    There is no need to initialize vma linkage all over, just do it before
    inserting the vma in list or tree.  /proc/pid/statm had an odd test for its
    shared count: simplified to an equivalent test on vm_file.

    [PATCH] rmap 15: vma_adjust
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    If file-based vmas are to be kept in a tree, according to the file offsets
    they map, then adjusting the vma's start pgoff or its end involves
    repositioning in the tree, while holding i_shared_lock (and page_table_lock).
    We used to avoid that if possible, e.g.  when just moving end; but if we're
    heading that way, let's now tidy up vma_merge and split_vma, and do all the
    locking and adjustment in a new helper vma_adjust.  And please, let's call the
    next vma in vma_merge "next" rather than "prev".
    
    Since these patches are diffed over 2.6.6-rc2-mm2, they include the NUMA
    mpolicy mods which you'll have to remove to go earlier in the series, sorry
    for that nuisance.  I have intentionally changed the one vma_mpol_equal to
    mpol_equal, to make the merge cases more alike.

    [PATCH] numa api: Add statistics
    
    From: Andi Kleen <ak@suse.de>
    
    Add NUMA hit/miss statistics to page allocation and display them in sysfs.
    
    This is not 100% required for NUMA API, but without this it is very
    
    The overhead is quite low because all counters are per CPU and only happens
    when CONFIG_NUMA is defined.

    [PATCH] small numa api fixups
    
    From: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>
    
    - don't include mempolicy.h in sched.h and mm.h when a forward delcaration
      is enough.  Andi argued against that in the past, but I'd really hate to add
      another header to two of the includes used in basically every driver when we
      can include it in the six files actually needing it instead (that number is
      for my ppc32 system, maybe other arches need more include in their
      directories)
    
    - make numa api fields in tast_struct conditional on CONFIG_NUMA, this gives
      us a few ugly ifdefs but avoids wasting memory on non-NUMA systems.

    [PATCH] numa api: Add shared memory support
    
    From: Andi Kleen <ak@suse.de>
    
    Add support to tmpfs and hugetlbfs to support NUMA API.  Shared memory is a
    bit of a special case for NUMA policy.  Normally policy is associated to VMAs
    or to processes, but for a shared memory segment you really want to share the
    policy.  The core NUMA API has code for that, this patch adds the necessary
    changes to tmpfs and hugetlbfs.
    
    First it changes the custom swapping code in tmpfs to follow the policy set
    via VMAs.
    
    It is also useful to have a "backing store" of policy that saves the policy
    even when nobody has the shared memory segment mapped.  This allows command
    line tools to pre configure policy, which is then later used by programs.
    
    Note that hugetlbfs needs more changes - it is also required to switch it to
    lazy allocation, otherwise the prefault prevents mbind() from working.

    NUMA API adds a policy to each VMA.  During VMA creattion, merging and

    works.

    will wait for this area to settle when demand paged large pages is merged.

    [PATCH] numa api: Core NUMA API code
    
    From: Andi Kleen <ak@suse.de>
    
    The following patches add support for configurable NUMA memory policy
    for user processes. It is based on the proposal from last kernel summit
    with feedback from various people.
    
    This NUMA API doesn't not attempt to implement page migration or anything
    else complicated: all it does is to police the allocation when a page
    is first allocation or when a page is reallocated after swapping. Currently
    only support for shared memory and anonymous memory is there; policy for
    file based mappings is not implemented yet (although they get implicitely
    policied by the default process policy)
    
    It adds three new system calls: mbind to change the policy of a VMA,
    set_mempolicy to change the policy of a process, get_mempolicy to retrieve
    memory policy. User tools (numactl, libnuma, test programs, manpages) can be
    found in  ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/ak/numa/numactl-0.6.tar.gz
    
    For details on the system calls see the manpages
    http://www.firstfloor.org/~andi/mbind.html
    http://www.firstfloor.org/~andi/set_mempolicy.html
    http://www.firstfloor.org/~andi/get_mempolicy.html
    Most user programs should actually not use the system calls directly,
    but use the higher level functions in libnuma
    (http://www.firstfloor.org/~andi/numa.html) or the command line tools
    (http://www.firstfloor.org/~andi/numactl.html
    
    The system calls allow user programs and administors to set various NUMA memory
    policies for putting memory on specific nodes. Here is a short description
    of the policies copied from the kernel patch:
    
     * NUMA policy allows the user to give hints in which node(s) memory should
     * be allocated.
     *
     * Support four policies per VMA and per process:
     *
     * The VMA policy has priority over the process policy for a page fault.
     *
     * interleave     Allocate memory interleaved over a set of nodes,
     *                with normal fallback if it fails.
     *                For VMA based allocations this interleaves based on the
     *                offset into the backing object or offset into the mapping
     *                for anonymous memory. For process policy an process counter
     *                is used.
     * bind           Only allocate memory on a specific set of nodes,
     *                no fallback.
     * preferred      Try a specific node first before normal fallback.
     *                As a special case node -1 here means do the allocation
     *                on the local CPU. This is normally identical to default,
     *                but useful to set in a VMA when you have a non default
     *                process policy.
     * default        Allocate on the local node first, or when on a VMA
     *                use the process policy. This is what Linux always did
     *                in a NUMA aware kernel and still does by, ahem, default.
     *
     * The process policy is applied for most non interrupt memory allocations
     * in that process' context. Interrupts ignore the policies and always
     * try to allocate on the local CPU. The VMA policy is only applied for memory
     * allocations for a VMA in the VM.
     *
     * Currently there are a few corner cases in swapping where the policy
     * is not applied, but the majority should be handled. When process policy
     * is used it is not remembered over swap outs/swap ins.
     *
     * Only the highest zone in the zone hierarchy gets policied. Allocations
     * requesting a lower zone just use default policy. This implies that
     * on systems with highmem kernel lowmem allocation don't get policied.
     * Same with GFP_DMA allocations.
     *
     * For shmfs/tmpfs/hugetlbfs shared memory the policy is shared between
     * all users and remembered even when nobody has memory mapped.
    
    
    
    
    This patch:
    
    This is the core NUMA API code. This includes NUMA policy aware
    wrappers for get_free_pages and alloc_page_vma(). On non NUMA kernels
    these are defined away.
    
    The system calls mbind (see http://www.firstfloor.org/~andi/mbind.html),
    get_mempolicy (http://www.firstfloor.org/~andi/get_mempolicy.html) and
    set_mempolicy (http://www.firstfloor.org/~andi/set_mempolicy.html) are
    implemented here.
    
    Adds a vm_policy field to the VMA and to the process. The process
    also has field for interleaving. VMA interleaving uses the offset
    into the VMA, but that's not possible for process allocations.
    
    From: Andi Kleen <ak@muc.de>
    
      > Andi, how come policy_vma() calls ->set_policy under i_shared_sem?
    
      I think this can be actually dropped now.  In an earlier version I did
      walk the vma shared list to change the policies of other mappings to the
      same shared memory region.  This turned out too complicated with all the
      corner cases, so I eventually gave in and added ->get_policy to the fast
      path.  Also there is still the mmap_sem which prevents races in the same MM.
    
    
      Patch to remove it attached.  Also adds documentation and removes the
      bogus __alloc_page_vma() prototype noticed by hch.
    
    From: Andi Kleen <ak@suse.de>
    
      A few incremental fixes for NUMA API.
    
      - Fix a few comments
    
      - Add a compat_ function for get_mem_policy I considered changing the
        ABI to avoid this, but that would have made the API too ugly.  I put it
        directly into the file because a mm/compat.c didn't seem worth it just for
        this.
    
      - Fix the algorithm for VMA interleave.
    
    From: Matthew Dobson <colpatch@us.ibm.com>
    
      1) Move the extern of alloc_pages_current() into #ifdef CONFIG_NUMA.
        The only references to the function are in NUMA code in mempolicy.c
    
      2) Remove the definitions of __alloc_page_vma().  They aren't used.
    
      3) Move forward declaration of struct vm_area_struct to top of file.

    [PATCH] rmap 14: i_shared_lock fixes
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    First of batch of six patches which introduce Rajesh Venkatasubramanian's
    implementation of a radix priority search tree of vmas, to handle object-based
    reverse mapping corner cases well.
    
    rmap 14 i_shared_lock fixes
    
    Start the sequence with a couple of outstanding i_shared_lock fixes.
    
    Since i_shared_sem became i_shared_lock, we've had to shift and then
    temporarily remove mremap move's protection of concurrent truncation - if
    mremap moves ptes while unmap_mapping_range_list is making its way through the
    vmas, there's a danger we'd move a pte from an area yet to be cleaned back
    into an area already cleared.
    
    Now site the i_shared_lock with the page_table_lock in move_one_page.  Replace
    page_table_present by get_one_pte_map, so we know when it's necessary to
    allocate a new page table: in which case have to drop i_shared_lock, trylock
    and perhaps reorder locks on the way back.  Yet another fix: must check for
    NULL dst before pte_unmap(dst).
    
    And over in rmap.c, try_to_unmap_file's cond_resched amidst its lengthy
    nonlinear swapping was now causing might_sleep warnings: moved to a rather
    unsatisfactory and less frequent cond_resched_lock on i_shared_lock when we
    reach the end of the list; and one before starting on the nonlinears too: the
    "cursor" may become out-of-date if we do schedule, but I doubt it's worth
    bothering about.

    [PATCH] Convert i_shared_sem back to a spinlock
    
    Having a semaphore in there causes modest performance regressions on heavily
    mmap-intensive workloads on some hardware.  Specifically, up to 30% in SDET on
    NUMAQ and big PPC64.
    
    So switch it back to being a spinlock.  This does mean that unmap_vmas() needs
    to be told whether or not it is allowed to schedule away; that's simple to do
    via the zap_details structure.
    
    This change means that there will be high scheuling latencies when someone
    truncates a large file which is currently mmapped, but nobody does that
    anyway.  The scheduling points in unmap_vmas() are mainly for munmap() and
    exit(), and they still will work OK for that.
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
      Sorry, my premature optimizations (trying to pass down NULL zap_details
      except when needed) have caught you out doubly: unmap_mapping_range_list was
      NULLing the details even though atomic was set; and if it hadn't, then
      zap_pte_range would have missed free_swap_and_cache and pte_clear when pte
      not present.  Moved the optimization into zap_pte_range itself.  Plus
      massive documentation update.
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
      Here's a second patch to add to the first: mremap's cows can't come home
      without releasing the i_mmap_lock, better move the whole "Subtle point"
      locking from move_vma into move_page_tables.  And it's possible for the file
      that was behind an anonymous page to be truncated while we drop that lock,
      don't want to abort mremap because of VM_FAULT_SIGBUS.
    
      (Eek, should we be checking do_swap_page of a vm_file area against the
      truncate_count sequence?  Technically yes, but I doubt we need bother.)
    
    
    - We cannot hold i_mmap_lock across move_one_page() because
      move_one_page() needs to perform __GFP_WAIT allocations of pagetable pages.
    
    - Move the cond_resched() out so we test it once per page rather than only
      when move_one_page() returns -EAGAIN.

    [PATCH] rmap 12 pgtable remove rmap
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    Remove the support for pte_chain rmap from page table initialization, just
    continue to maintain nr_page_table_pages (but only for user page tables -
    it also counted vmalloc page tables before, little need, and I'm unsure if
    per-cpu stats are safe early enough on all arches).  mm/memory.c is the
    only core file affected.
    
    But ppc and ppc64 have found the old rmap page table initialization useful
    to support their ptep_test_and_clear_young: so transfer rmap's
    initialization to them (even on kernel page tables?  well, okay).

    [PATCH] rmap 11 mremap moves
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    A weakness of the anonmm scheme is its difficulty in tracking pages shared
    between two or more mms (one being an ancestor of the other), when mremap has
    been used to move a range of pages in one of those mms.  mremap move is not
    very common anyway, and it's more often used on a page range exclusive to the
    mm; but uncommon though it may be, we must not allow unlocked pages to become
    unswappable.
    
    This patch follows Linus' suggestion, simply to take a private copy of the
    page in such a case: early C-O-W.  My previous implementation was daft with
    respect to pages currently on swap: it insisted on swapping them in to copy
    them.  No need for that: just take the copy when a page is brought in from
    swap, and its intended address is found to clash with what rmap has already
    noted.
    
    If do_swap_page has to make this copy in the mremap moved case (simply a call
    to do_wp_page), might as well do so also in the case when it's a write access
    but the page not exclusive, it's always seemed a little odd that swapin needed
    a second fault for that.  A bug even: get_user_pages force imagines that a
    single call to handle_mm_fault must break C-O-W.  Another bugfix: swapoff's
    unuse_process didn't check is_vm_hugetlb_page.
    
    Andrea's anon_vma has no such problem with mremap moved pages, handling them
    with elegant use of vm_pgoff - though at some cost to vma merging.  How
    important is it to handle them efficiently?  For now there's a msg
    printk(KERN_WARNING "%s: mremap moved %d cows\n", current->comm, cows);

    [PATCH] rmap 10 add anonmm rmap
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    Hugh's anonmm object-based reverse mapping scheme for anonymous pages.  We
    have not yet decided whether to adopt this scheme, or Andrea's more advanced
    anon_vma scheme.  anonmm is easier for me to merge quickly, to replace the
    pte_chain rmap taken out in the previous patch; a patch to install Andrea's
    anon_vma will follow in due course.
    
    Why build up and tear down chains of pte pointers for anonymous pages, when a
    page can only appear at one particular address, in a restricted group of mms
    that might share it?  (Except: see next patch on mremap.)
    
    Introduce struct anonmm per mm to track anonymous pages, all forks from one
    exec sharing the same bundle of linked anonmms.  Anonymous pages originate in
    one mm, but may be forked into another mm of the bundle later on.  Callouts
    from fork.c to allocate, dup and exit the anonmm structure private to rmap.c.
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
      Two concurrent exits (of the last two mms sharing the anonhd).  First
      exit_rmap brings anonhd->count down to 2, gets preempted (at the
      spin_unlock) by second, which brings anonhd->count down to 1, sees it's 1
      and frees the anonhd (without making any change to anonhd->count itself),
      cpu goes on to do something new which reallocates the old anonhd as a new
      struct anonmm (probably not a head, in which case count will start at 1),
      first resumes after the spin_unlock and sees anonhd->count 1, frees "anonhd"
      again, it's used for something else, a later exit_rmap list_del finds list
      corrupt.

    [PATCH] rmap 9 remove pte_chains
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    Lots of deletions: the next patch will put in the new anon rmap, which
    should look clearer if first we remove all of the old pte-pointer-based
    rmap from the core in this patch - which therefore leaves anonymous rmap
    totally disabled, anon pages locked in memory until process frees them.
    
    Leave arch files (and page table rmap) untouched for now, clean them up in
    a later batch.  A few constructive changes amidst all the deletions:
    
    Choose names (e.g.  page_add_anon_rmap) and args (e.g.  no more pteps) now
    so we need not revisit so many files in the next patch.  Inline function
    page_dup_rmap for fork's copy_page_range, simply bumps mapcount under lock.
     cond_resched_lock in copy_page_range.  Struct page rearranged: no pte
    union, just mapcount moved next to atomic count, so two ints can occupy one
    long on 64-bit; i386 struct page now 32 bytes even with PAE.  Never pass
    PageReserved to page_remove_rmap, only do_wp_page did so.

      Move page_add_anon_rmap's BUG_ON(page_mapping(page)) inside the rmap_lock
      (well, might as well just check mapping if !mapcount then): if this page is
      being mapped or unmapped on another cpu at the same time, page_mapping's
      PageAnon(page) and page->mapping are volatile.
    
      But page_mapping(page) is used more widely: I've a nasty feeling that
      clear_page_anon, page_add_anon_rmap and/or page_mapping need barriers added
      (also in 2.6.6 itself),

    [PATCH] slab: consolidate panic code
    
    Many places do:
    
    	if (kmem_cache_create(...) == NULL)
    		panic(...);
    
    We can consolidate all that by passing another flag to kmem_cache_create()
    which says "panic if it doesn't work".

    [PATCH] rmap 8 unmap nonlinear
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    The previous patch let the ptes of file pages be located via page
    ->mapping->i_mmap and i_mmap_shared lists of vmas; which works well unless
    the vma is VM_NONLINEAR - one in which sys_remap_file_pages has been used
    to place pages in unexpected places, to avoid an explosion of distinct
    unmergable vmas.  Such pages were effectively locked in memory.
    
    page_referenced_file is already skipping nonlinear vmas, they'd just waste
    its time, and age unfairly any pages in their proper positions.  Now extend
    try_to_unmap_file, to persuade it to swap from nonlinears.
    
    Ignoring the page requested, try to unmap cluster of 32 neighbouring ptes
    (in worst case all empty slots) in a nonlinear vma, then move on to the
    next vma; stopping when we've unmapped at least as many maps as the
    requested page had (vague guide of how hard to try), or have reached the
    end.  With large sparse nonlinear vmas, this could take a long time:
    inserted a cond_resched while no locks are held, unusual at this level but
    I think okay, shrink_list does so.
    
    Use vm_private_data a little like the old mm->swap_address, as a cursor
    recording how far we got, so we don't attack the same ptes next time around
    (earlier tried inserting an empty marker vma in the list, but that got
    messy).  How well this will work on real- life nonlinear vmas remains to be
    seen, but should work better than locking them all in memory, or swapping
    everything out all the time.
    
    Existing users of vm_private_data have either VM_RESERVED or VM_DONTEXPAND
    set, both of which are in the VM_SPECIAL category where we never try to
    merge vmas: so removed the vm_private_data test from is_mergeable_vma, so
    we can still merge VM_NONLINEARs.  Of course, we could instead add another
    field to vm_area_struct.

    [PATCH] rmap 7 object-based rmap
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
    Dave McCracken's object-based reverse mapping scheme for file pages: why
    build up and tear down chains of pte pointers for file pages, when
    page->mapping has i_mmap and i_mmap_shared lists of all the vmas which
    might contain that page, and it appears at one deterministic position
    within the vma (unless vma is nonlinear - see next patch)?
    
    Has some drawbacks: more work to locate the ptes from page_referenced and
    try_to_unmap, especially if the i_mmap lists contain a lot of vmas covering
    different ranges; has to down_trylock the i_shared_sem, and hope that
    doesn't fail too often.  But attractive in that it uses less lowmem, and
    shifts the rmap burden away from the hot paths, to swapout.
    
    Hybrid scheme for the moment: carry on with pte_chains for anonymous pages,
    that's unchanged; but file pages keep mapcount in the pte union of struct
    page, where anonymous pages keep chain pointer or direct pte address: so
    page_mapped(page) works on both.
    
    Hugh massaged it a little: distinct page_add_file_rmap entry point; list
    searches check rss so as not to waste time on mms fully swapped out; check
    mapcount to terminate once all ptes have been found; and a WARN_ON if
    page_referenced should have but couldn't find all the ptes.

    [PATCH] __set_page_dirty_nobuffers race fix
    
    Running __mark_inode_dirty() against a swapcache page is illegal and will
    oops.
    
    I see a race in set_page_dirty() wherein it can be called with a PageSwapCache
    page, but if the page is removed from swapcache after
    __set_page_dirty_nobuffers() drops tree_lock(), we have the situation where
    PageSwapCache() is false, but local variable `mapping' points at swapcache.
    
    Handle that by checking for non-null mapping->host.  We don't care about the
    page state at this point - we're only interested in the inode.
    
    
    
    There is a converse case: what if a page is added to swapcache as we are
    running set_page_dirty() against it?
    
    In this case the page gets its PG_dirty flag set but it is not tagged as dirty
    in the swapper_space radix tree.  The swap writeout code will handle this OK
    and test_clear_page_dirty()'s call to
    radix_tree_tag_clear(PAGECACHE_TAG_DIRTY) will silently have no effect.  The
    only downside is that future radix-tree-based writearound won't notice that
    such pages are dirty and swap IO scheduling will be a teensy bit worse.
    
    
    The patch also fixes the (silly) testing of local variable `mapping' to see if
    the page was truncated.  We should test page_mapping() for that.

    [PATCH] revert recent swapcache handling changes
    
    Go back to the 2.6.5 concepts, with rmap additions.  In particular:
    
    - Implement Andrea's flavour of page_mapping().  This function opaquely does
      the right thing for pagecache pages, anon pages and for swapcache pages.
    
      The critical thing here is that page_mapping() returns &swapper_space for
      swapcache pages without actually requiring the storage at page->mapping.
      This frees page->mapping for the anonmm/anonvma metadata.
    
    - Andrea and Hugh placed the pagecache index of swapcache pages into
      page->private rather than page->index.  So add new page_index() function
      which hides this.
    
    - Make swapper_space.set_page_dirty() again point at
      __set_page_dirty_buffers().  If we don't do that, a bare set_page_dirty()
      will fall through to __set_page_dirty_buffers(), which is silly.
    
      This way, __set_page_dirty_buffers() can continue to use page->mapping.
      It should never go near anon or swapcache pages.
    
    - Give swapper_space a ->set_page_dirty address_space_operation method, so
      that set_page_dirty() will not fall through to __set_page_dirty_buffers()
      for swapcache pages.  That function is not set up to handle them.
    
    
    The main effect of these changes is that swapcache pages are treated more
    similarly to pagecache pages.  And we are again tagging swapcache pages as
    dirty in their radix tree, which is a requirement if we later wish to
    implement swapcache writearound based on tagged radix-tree walks.

    ->tree_lock is supposed to be IRQ-safe.  Hugh worked out that with his
    changes, we never actually take it from interrupt context, so spin_lock() is
    sufficient.
    
    Apart from kinda freaking me out, the analysis which led to this decision
    becomes untrue with later patches.  So make it irq-safe.

    the long name [as shown in 'cat /proc/mounts'].)
    
    [Thanks to devfs hero whose name I forgot.]

    [PATCH] swsusp: kill unneccessary debugging

    This is no longer neccessary.  We have enough pauses elsewhere, and it works
    well enough that this is not needed.

    [PATCH] blk: clear completion stack pointer on return
    
    From: Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>
    
    It doesn't always look safe to let ->waiting remain set when returning from
    functions that set it to point to stack area, since various locations check
    for != NULL to see if it's valid.  So clear it on return from
    ide_do_drive_cmd() and blk_execute_rq().

    [PATCH] Sanitise handling of unneeded syscall stubs
    
    From: David Mosberger <davidm@napali.hpl.hp.com>
    
    Below is a patch that tries to sanitize the dropping of unneeded system-call
    stubs in generic code.  In some instances, it would be possible to move the
    optional system-call stubs into a library routine which would avoid the need
    for #ifdefs, but in many cases, doing so would require making several
    functions global (and possibly exporting additional data-structures in
    header-files).  Furthermore, it would inhibit (automatic) inlining in the
    cases in the cases where the stubs are needed.  For these reasons, the patch
    keeps the #ifdef-approach.
    
    This has been tested on ia64 and there were no objections from the
    arch-maintainers (and one positive response).  The patch should be safe but
    arch-maintainers may want to take a second look to see if some __ARCH_WANT_foo
    macros should be removed for their architecture (I'm quite sure that's the
    case, but I wanted to play it safe and only preserved the status-quo in that
    regard).

    [PATCH] fbdev: mode switching fix.
    
    From: James Simmons <jsimmons@infradead.org>
    
    This fixes the bugs that where in mode switch via stty.
    
    The problem was we couldn't set the mode just by using the x and y
    resolution.  We use modedb to fill in the rest.  There also was a bug that
    allowed you to change the console resolution for drivers with fixed
    resolutions.  This would mess up your display.  Now that is fixed.

    [PATCH] fix sendfile on 64bit architectures
    
    From: Andi Kleen <ak@suse.de>
    
    sys_sendfile has a hardcoded 2GB limit.  64bit architectures should
    probably always use sys_sendfile64() in their native system tables, because
    for them sizeof(off_t) == sizeof(loff_t).  This patch does this.  It seemed
    easier to just change the 64bit entry tables instead of fixing up all the
    emulation layers to do 2GB checks on their own.
    
    I changed all 64bit architectures except for parisc64, which seemed to
    already have a sendfile64.

    [XFS] xfs_iomap_write_delay() was doing speculative allocations
     without checking if there were any real blocks already in the
     speculative allocation area. This could result in an allocation
     that overlaps pre-allocated space. This would result in an ASSERT
     failure in debug kernels, or invalid output from xfs_bmap.
     The code will now only do speculative allocation if we are writing
     beyond the current allocation eof.

    [ARM PATCH] 1887/1: Update OMAP low level debug functions again
    
    Patch from Tony Lindgren
    
    This patch makes the low level debug functions work when support is
    compiled in for multiple OMAPs. The patch also removes now unnecessary
    include, incorrect comment, and SERIAL_REG_SHIFT ifdefs.

    Patch from Nicolas Pitre
    
    Since the iWMMXt patch (#1866/1) requires more time to be reviewed,
    this patch will allow merging Mainstone patches without breaking
    anything if iWMMXt support isn't merged yet.
    Should be applied after patch #1867/1.

    [REDO] ramdisk: separate the blockdev backing_dev_info from the hosted inodes
    
    This re-applies the separation of the ramdisk blockdev inode
    backing store and the files that live in the ramdisk.

    [PATCH] block device layer: separate backing_dev_info infrastructure
    
    Sigh.  ramdisk almost works, except it loses data on umount.
    
    This is because the files which are atop the ramdisk do not contribute to
    dirty memory accounting, but they do need writeback.  So when sync() calls
    sync_inodes_sb() to do the work, sync_inodes_sb() hopelessly underestimates
    the number of pages which need writeback for a complete sync.
    
    If you run `sync' enough times, everything eventually hits "disk" and all is
    happy.
    
    The root cause here is that the ramdisk and the files which it hosts shared
    the same backing_dev_info.  This is inappropriate because the hosted files
    *do* want to writeback and really should contribute to dirty memory
    accounting. But the ramdisk inode itself wants neither.
    
    So.  The patch sets up the infrastructure which permits a blockdev to provide
    a separate backing_dev_info for the files which it hosts.  It's a bit of a
    ramdisk-special.

    ia64).

    [PATCH] Fix i386/x86_64 cpuid/msr BUG() on impossible CPUs
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    Matthieu Castet <castet.matthieu@free.fr> pointed out that testing
    cpu_online(cpu) on a UP system goes BUG().
    
    That's because you're never supposed to ask cpu_online() about a CPU which
    is >= NR_CPUS.  msr and cpuid devices use the minor to indicate the CPU
    number.  Oops.
    
    Fix is to explicitly test cpu < NR_CPUS.  Using cpu_online() is OK;
    although the CPU might go down before you actually read the file, that will
    simply cause junk to be returned.

    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    From:  "Chen, Kenneth W" <kenneth.w.chen@intel.com>
    
    Pure cosmetic.  Largest biovec slab is printed as biovec-BIO_MAX_PAGES in
    /proc/slabinfo.  It would be more informative to print actual number instead
    of macro's name.

    [PATCH] Fix NFSD oops in readdir
    
    From: Neil Brown <neilb@cse.unsw.edu.au>
    
    If a single readdir entry needs to be split over two pages in the reply, we
    first encode it into a new page, and then copy the bits into place.  When
    we do this relocation, we have to modify the "offset" pointer to be either
    in the first or the second page, as appropriate.
    
    If the pointer should be at the start of the second page, it is currently
    put past the end of the first page.
    
    Note that as the offset and whole response is known to be 4byte-aligned,
    the offset pointer will never be split over two pages.

    [PATCH] getblk() BUG removal
    
    We keep on getting BUG()s from isofs_read_super() because it passes an insane
    blocksize to bread().  See http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2735 for
    example.
    
    I don't know what's up with isofs, but going BUG in there seems a bit rude.
    Change it to drop a bunch of diagnostics and a backtrace then return a null
    bh*.
    
    Most callers of getblk() don't expect it to fail, so they'll oops anyway.  But
    isofs does actually check for a NULL return.  This way, the machine stays up
    and we get better debug diagnostics.

    [PATCH] Debugging option to put data symbols in kallsyms
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    kallsyms contains only function names, but some debuggers (eg.  xmon on
    PPC/PPC64) use it to lookup symbols: it'd be much nicer if it included data
    symbols too.

    [PATCH] ramdisk: fix PageUptodate() handling
    
    When a filesystem does getblk() to get a buffer_head against the ramdisk the
    VFS will allocate a new not-uptodate pagecache page and will attach buffers to
    it.
    
    The filesystem will then bring certain buffer_heads uptodate.  But not the
    whole page.
    
    Later, various ramdisk a_ops see the not-uptodate page and wipe the whole
    thing out, including the parts to which the filesystem wrote!
    
    Fix that up by only zapping those parts of the page which are covered by
    non-uptodate buffers.

    [PATCH] ramdisk: lock blockdev pages during "IO".
    
    There's a race: one CPU writes a 1k block into a ramdisk page which isn't in
    the blockdev pagecache yet.  It memsets the locked page to zeroes.
    
    While this is happening, another CPU comes in and tries to write a different
    1k block to the "disk".  But it doesn't lock the page so it races with the
    memset and can have its data scribbled over.
    
    Fix this up by locking the page even if it already existed in pagecache.
    
    Locking a pagecache page in a make_request_fn sounds deadlocky but it is not,
    because:
    
    a) ramdisk_writepage() does nothing but a set_bit(), and cannot recur onto
       the same page.
    
    b) Any higher-level code which holds a page lock is supposed to be
       allocating its memory with GFP_NOFS, and in 2.6 kernels that's equivalent
       to GFP_NOIO.
    
       (The distinction between GFP_NOIO and GFP_NOFS basically disappeared
       with the buffer_head LRU, although it was reused for writes to swap).

    [PATCH] ppc64: make enter_rtas() take unsigned long arg
    
    From: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>
    
    We declare enter_rtas with a struct rtas_args * argument, though it is
    supposed to be a physical address, and then every time we call it we cast the
    unsigned long result from __pa() to a void *.  This patch changes the
    declaration of enter_rtas to make it take an unsigned long argument, and
    removes the cast from all the callers.  The actual enter_rtas() routine is in
    assembler and doesn't need to be changed.

    [PATCH] ppc64: update xmon debugger
    
    From: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>
    
    This patch fixes a whole pile of problems in the xmon kernel debugger for
    ppc64.  This basically makes xmon SMP-safe.  Now, when we enter xmon it
    sends an IPI to the other CPUs to get them into xmon too.  It also changes
    the way we do single-stepping and breakpoints so that we don't have to
    remove a breakpoint to proceed from it (instead we either emulate the
    instruction where the breakpoint was, or execute it out of place).  With
    this patch, if we get an exception inside xmon, it will just return to the
    xmon command loop instead of hanging the system as at present.
    
    The patch is quite large because it updates the disassembler to the latest
    version from binutils (trimmed a bit), which is why I didn't cc lkml.

    When hotplug cpu isn't enabled, cpu_is_offline is always false.  I had a stuck

    thread on it.  Instead of cpu_is_offline we can use !cpu_online which should
    cover both the hotplug cpu enabled and disabled cases.

    SCSI: make inquiry timeout tuneable
    
    From: garloff@suse.de
    
    Feature
    
    Make the timeout for INQUIRY during SCSI scan adjustable via boot parameter.
    Note that the second INQUIRY does use a shorter timeout, as the long timeout
    is for recovery from the initial reset, not because existing devices would
    take so long to answer INQUIRY. SPC3 says that INQUIRY should be available
    right away, but real life is different unfortunately.

    SCSI: make SCSI REPORT LUNS the default
    
    From: garloff@suse.de
    
    Cleanup/Feature
    
    Remove CONFIG_SCSI_REPORT_LUNS config option.
    Instead provide BLIST_NOREPORTLUN that can be passed as default_dev_flags
    (but also per device if needed).
    Provide BLIST_REPORTLUN2 that allows trying to use REPORT_LUNS for SCSI-2
    devices, if they are connected to a host adapter supporting more than 8 LUNs
    (and thus avoiding the usual USB crap to render this feature useless when
    used with default_dev_flags).

    tmscsim: remove procfs write support from tmscsim
    
    From: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>
    
    When looking at the driver after reviewing the changes I stubled over
    that code.  Almost all of the funcitonality (except DUMP) should go
    through the midlayer and will at least cause some confusion if it
    doesn't.
    
    Also the implementation isn't exactly nice, like kmalloced scsi commands
    and the tytpical 'parsing' macros cut & pasted over all historic scsi
    drivers.  I think we're better of removing it completly and maybe readd
    dump as a sysfs attribute if needed.
    
    500 lines of code gone.

    [PATCH] tmscsim: no internal queue
    
    Here comes the 2nd one. I wanted to get Christoph's patches now in, but
    already the first his patch comes on the top of this one: remove internal
    command queuing in the driver. And, in fact, it fixes some bugs in it. So,
    they should go in together. Here's the original comment from Christoph's
    email of 1 Feb 2004:
    
    <start quote>
    
    Patch looks mostly good for me.  But there's some fishyness in queuecommand,
    mostly from before you patch:
    
     - many failure cases return one with the new EH code although we wouldn't
       want to requeue the midlayer in that case.  I removed the ifdef and added
       a failed goto to handle them.
     - we need to set cmd->result onlyh if we have an error instead of always
       an overriding it - else it will leak to the midlayer in the return 1
       case.
     - the check for ids out of range are superflous (this was one of the errors
       above, I decided to remove it instead of fixing it).
     - you don't do DC390_UNLOCK_ACB when failing.  While it's a noop I think
       it's bad to have locking macros in place and don't balance them.  You
       should probably remove it completly in one of the next patches.
     - the pDCB->pWaitingSRB looks a bit strange.  By unifying the the codepathes
       it becomes much more readable.

    [PATCH] tmscsim: 64-bit cleanup
    
    Ok, here comes the first one. I chose this one because it fixes an actual
    bug in the driver. This bug was (partially) introduced by myself when
    porting to 2.6. Partly the reason was that I disliked using
    function-like macros as lvalues:
    
    sg_dma_address(x) = ...
    sg_dma_len(x) = ...
    
    [OT] wouldn't it be better to introduce some macros like
    set_sg_dma_{address|len}(x, y)?
    
    A part of the original patch has already been merged (s/UINT/ULONG/), so,
    the actual version is re-diffed against 2.6.6-bk6 and re-tested (on a
    plain Pentium).
    
    Also updates the driver-version, printed on startup.

    NFS O_DIRECT: Change the NFS O_DIRECT path so that it
        no longer calls the generic VFS read and write routines.
        This allows all application read requests to pass through
        to the server, instead of just the ones that appear to be
        inside the file. this eliminates the requirement to use a
        GETATTR operation before each read or write to determine
        where the EOF is. This is a significant performance and
        scalability win.
    
        It also removes all requirements for holding the inode
        semaphore during NFS direct reads and writes, as the read
        and write logic no longer needs atomic access to the size
        of the file. this also helps client CPU scalability by
        reducing the serialization of writes against a single file.

    JFS: [CHECKER] if txCommit fails, don't call d_instantiate
    
    In several functions, d_instantiate is called before the transaction
    is committed.  Under the rare condition that txCommit fails, the new
    inode is released, but the dentry continues to point to it.  This
    can lead to a seg fault.  The fix is to call d_instantiate after
    txCommit has run successfully.

    [PATCH] Invalid notify_change(symlink, [ATTR_MODE]) in nfsd
    
    Make sure NFS client doesn't see errors from mode setting on new symlinks.
    
    When nfsd creates a symlink, it tries to set the mode as the mode is
    carried in the NFS request and some filesystems store a mode.
    
    If the filesystem refuses to set the mode (e.g. -EOPNOTSUPP), this
    error should not be returned to the client.

    [PATCH] raid locking fix.
    
    From: Neil Brown <neilb@cse.unsw.edu.au>
    
    Fix bug #2661
    
    Raid currently calls ->unplug_fn under spin_lock_irqsave(), but unplug_fns
    can sleep.
    
    
    After a morning of scratching my head and trying to come up with some that
    does less locking, the following is the best I can come up with.  I'm not
    proud of it but it should work.
    
    If I move "nr_pending" out or rdev into the per-personality structures
    (e.g.  mirror_info), and if I had "atomic_inc_if_nonzero" I could do with
    without locking so much, but random atomic* functions don't seem trivial

    [PATCH] use-before-uninitialized value in ext3(2)_find_ goal
    
    From: Mingming Cao <cmm@us.ibm.com>
    
    There is a uninitialized goal value being referenced in both ext3 and ext2
    find goal block functions (ext3_find_goal() and ext2_find_goal()).
    
    In the non-sequential write case, these functions check the goal value(non
    zero) before calling ext3(2)_find_near() to find the goal block to
    allocate.
    
    Since the goal value is uninitialized(non zero), the ext3(2)_find_near() is
    never being called in the non-sequential write, thus ext3(2)_find_goal()
    failed to guide a goal block in the random write case.
    
    ext3(2)_new_block() takes the junk goal value and will turn it to goal 0
    since it's normally beyond the filesystem block number limit.  The fix is
    trivial.

    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    The IA64 hotplug CPU merge seems to have included some core changes: in
    particular the recalc_bh_state() needs to sum for all (including offline)
    cpus, since we don't empty the counters on CPU down.  The totals printed by
    /proc/stat (the first loop) should include offline cpus, too (apparently
    printing out the per-cpu lines for offline cpus confuses top).

    [PATCH] VFS cache sizing fix for small machines
    
    From: Matt Mackall <mpm@selenic.com>
    
    Doing the algebra:
    
    c = (a - b) * 3/2
    a' = a - c = a - 3/2(a - b) = (2a - 3a + 3b)/2 = (3b - a)/2
    a' >= 0
    3b - a >= 0
    3b >= a
    b >= a/3
    nr_free_pages() >= mempages/3
    
    We can indeed get into trouble if we try to load a large kernel on a very
    small box (ie kernel reserves more than 2/3 of usable memory).  Surprisingly I
    haven't hit this, but here's a fix.

    [PATCH] kNFSd: Remove check on number of threads waiting on user-space.
    
    From: NeilBrown <neilb@cse.unsw.edu.au>
    
    From: "J. Bruce Fields" <bfields@fieldses.org>
    
    Currently we are counting the number of threads already asleep and returning
    an immediate NFS4ERR_DELAY (==JUKEBOX) error if more than half are already
    asleep.
    
    This patch removes that logic, so instead we only return NFS4ERR_DELAY if an
    upcall times out (if it takes more than a second to return).
    
    With the thread counting there is the risk that even when all the relevant
    subsystems are responsive, the client may still see occasional NFS4ERR_DELAY
    returns just because, by coincidence, several upcalls were initiated at the
    same time.  I expect clients will delay several seconds before retrying after
    NFS4ERR_DELAY, so this will be quite noticeable to users.  Sporadic long
    delays like this are likely to lead users to suspect a problem somewhere, when
    in fact there is none.
    
    The current scheme ensures that we can still process requests not depending on
    upcalls, even when all threads would otherwise be tied up waiting on upcalls.
    However, this is not something that should happen under normal circumstances;
    if a server spends a significant portion of its time with all threads waiting
    for upcalls, this a sign that something is seriously wrong.
    
    In such a circumstance (e.g., an ldap server dies), we can, at least, bound
    the waiting time to a second without the need for counting threads.
    
    In short, removing the thread-counting will allow us to behave predictably
    when things are working, while still allowing some progress when they don't.
    
    It would be a worthwhile project to measure the amount of time threads spend
    waiting for upcalls (or for reads, for that matter); if a significant portion
    of the time they spend handling requests is spent sleeping, then there's an
    opportunity to improve nfsd performance: if we can break the one-to-one
    mapping between requests and threads, then we can lower the number of threads
    required to keep the nfs server busy.
    
    However, both the currently available options for doing this are problematic:
    returning JUKEBOX/DELAY errors at random times will lead to unpredictable
    performance, and saving a copy of the request to be processed from scratch
    again later is wasteful and makes it difficult to provide correct semantics,
    especially in the NFSv4 case.
    
    So for now I believe waits with short timeouts are the best option.

    From: NeilBrown <neilb@cse.unsw.edu.au>
    
    From: "J. Bruce Fields" <bfields@fieldses.org>
    
    1 second should be plenty of time; if we're going to take longer than that
    it's probably better just to return NFS4ERR_DELAY and let the client retry
    anyway.

    From: NeilBrown <neilb@cse.unsw.edu.au>
    
    From: "J. Bruce Fields" <bfields@fieldses.org>
    
    Slightly better behavior on failed mapping (which may happen either because
    idmapd is not running, or because there it has told us it doesn't know the
    mapping.):
    
    	on name->id (setattr), return BADNAME.  (I used ESRCH to
    		communicate BADNAME, just because it was the first error in
    		include/asm-generic/errno-base.h that had something to
    		do with nonexistance of something, and that we weren't
    		already using.)
    
    	id->name (getattr), return a string representation of the numerical
    		id.  This is probably useless to the client, especially
    		since we're unlikely to accept such a string on a setattr,
    		but perhaps some client will find it mildly helpful.

    fh_compose currently consumes a reference to the dentry but not the export
    point.  This is both inconsistent and confusing.
    
    It is better if a routine like this doesn't consume reference points, so with
    this patch, it doesn't.  This fixes a couple of very subtle and unusual
    reference counting errors.

    section more complete; to be fair, I added two other sites too.  Just in
    case it's useful.

    [PATCH] Quota fix 3 - quota file corruption
    
    From: Jan Kara <jack@ucw.cz>
    
    This patch fixes possible quota files corruption which could happen when root
    did not have any inodes&space allocated.
    
    Originally this could not happen as structure would not be written to disk in
    that case but with journalled quota we need to write even all-zero structure.
    The fix is not very nice but change of the format on disk is probably worse (I
    made a mistake with not including the usage-bitmaps into format :().

    kexec is a fairly major and popular feature.  People are shipping it in

    The patch reserves the kexec syscall slots to pin the ABI down for
    everyone.
    
    
    - add kexec_load prototype to syscalls.h
    
    - add LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_KEXEC to reboot.h
    
    - add kexec_load syscall for ia32, ia64, x86_64, ppc32, ppc64

    [PATCH] Fix for Makefiles to get KBUILD_OUTPUT working

    If you use O=/someotherdir or KBUILD_OUTPUT=/someotherdir on the following
    architectures: alpha, mips, sh and cris, the build process is probably
    going to fail at one point or another, depending on the target you used,
    because make can't find scripts/Makefile.build or scripts/Makefile.clean.
    
    The following patch fixes this, I greped the whole tree and these four were
    the only "offenders" I found.

    [PATCH] Work around gcc 3.3.3-hammer sched miscompilation on x86-64
    
    From: Andi Kleen <ak@muc.de>
    
    The new domain scheduler got miscompiled on x86-64 with gcc 3.3.3-hammer,
    which is shipping with some distributions.  The kernel deadlocks eventually
    under light stress on SMP systems with the right options.
    
    After some experiments it seems this simple change avoids the
    miscompilation.  It also doesn't pessimize the code unduly for other
    architectures.

    [PATCH] slab: add kmem_cache_alloc_node
    
    From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
    
    The attached patch adds a simple kmem_cache_alloc_node function: allocate
    memory on a given node.  The function is intended for cpu bound structures.
     It's used for alloc_percpu and for the slab-internal per-cpu structures.
    Jack Steiner reported a ~3% performance increase for AIM7 on a 64-way
    Itanium 2.
    
    Port maintainers: The patch could cause problems if CPU_UP_PREPARE is
    called for a cpu on a node before the corresponding memory is attached
    and/or if alloc_pages_node doesn't fall back to memory from another node if
    there is no memory in the requested node.  I think noone does that, but I'm
    not sure.

    [PATCH] slab: allow arch override for kmem_bufctl_t
    
    From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
    
    The slab allocator keeps track of the free objects in a slab with a linked
    list of integers (typedef'ed to kmem_bufctl_t).  Right now unsigned int is
    used for kmem_bufctl_t, i.e.  4 bytes per-object overhead.
    
    The attached patch implements a per-arch definition of for this type:
    Theoretically, unsigned short is sufficient for kmem_bufctl_t and this would
    reduce the per-object overhead to 2 bytes.  But some archs cannot operate on
    16-bit values efficiently, thus it's not possible to switch everyone to
    ushort.
    
    The chosen types are a result of dicussions with the various arch maintainers.

    compile time L1 cache line size to the runtime detected value for i386.
    x86-64 already uses the runtime detection.

    [PATCH] Fix arithmetic in shrink_zone()
    
    From: Nick Piggin <nickpiggin@yahoo.com.au>
    
    If the zone has a very small number of inactive pages, local variable
    `ratio' can be huge and we do way too much scanning.  So much so that Ingo
    hit an NMI watchdog expiry, although that was because the zone would have a
    had a single refcount-zero page in it, and that logic recently got fixed up
    via get_page_testone().
    
    Nick's patch simply puts a sane-looking upper bound on the number of pages
    which we'll scan in this round.
    
    
    It fixes another failure case: if the inactive list becomes very small
    compared to the size of the active list, active list scanning (and therefore
    inactive list refilling) also becomes small.
    
    This patch causes inactive list scanning to be keyed off the size of the
    active+inactive lists.  It has the plus of hiding active and inactive
    balancing implementation from the higher level scanning code.  It will
    slightly change other aspects of scanning behaviour, but probably not
    significantly.

    We're currently at 160.  The patch fairly arbitrarily takes it down to 152, so
    we can fit a 35-char name into the inline part of the dentry.
    
    Also, go back to the old way of sizing d_iname so that any arch-specific
    compiler-forced alignemnts are honoured.

    [PATCH] speed up readahead for seeky loads
    
    From: Ram Pai <linuxram@us.ibm.com>
    
    Currently the readahead code tends to read one more page than it should with
    seeky database-style loads.  This was to prevent bogus readahead triggering
    when we step into the last page of the current window.
    
    The patch removes that workaround and fixes up the suboptimal logic instead.
    
    
    wrt the "rounding errors" mentioned in this patch, Ram provided the following
    description:
    
      Say the i/o size is 20 pages.
    
      Our algorithm starts by a initial average i/o size of 'ra_pages/2' which
      is mostly say 16.
    
      Now every time we take a average, the 'average' progresses as follows
      (16+20)/2=18
      (18+20)/2=19
      (19+20)/2=19
      (19+20)/2=19.....
      and the rounding error makes it never touch 20

    [PATCH] PPC64: iSeries virtual ethernet transmit errors
    
    From: Stephen Rothwell <sfr@au1.ibm.com>
    
    This patch stops the iseries_veth driver trying to send every packet to too
    many logical partitions.  Consequently, the number of transmit errors falls to
    (about) zero from a very large number.  This should also improve performance a
    bit as the driver is no longer doing 31 extra skb_clone()s and skb_free()s for
    each packet.

    [PATCH] PPC32: Get full register set on bad kernel accesses
    
    From: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>
    
    At present on ppc32, if the kernel accesses a bad address and causes an
    oops, or drops into the xmon debugger, we only have the contents of the
    volatile registers available to print.  The reason is that we only save the
    volatile registers on entry for a page fault.
    
    This patch restructures the code a bit so that if do_page_fault()
    determines that the page fault is caused by a bad kernel access, it returns
    to the caller, which then saves the full register set into the exception
    frame before calling bad_page_fault().  This way we get the full set of
    registers printed in the oops message.

    [PATCH] system_state splitup
    
    Split the system_state state `SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN' into SYSTEM_HALT,
    SYSTEM_POWER_OFF and SYSTEM_RESTART and export system_state to modules.
    
    This allows driver shutdown routines to know why they are being shutdown.  The
    IDE subsystem wants this so that it knows to not spin the disks down across a
    reboot.

    JFS: Implement multiple commit threads
    
    For scalability, jfs now allows specifying the number of commit
    threads with the module parameter commit_threads=<num>.  It defaults
    to the number of processors.
    
    You can also change the number of txBlocks and txLocks allocated with
    the nTxBlock and nTxLock module parameters.  "modinfo jfs.ko" for
    specifics.

    SCSI: fix Stack overflow when lldd returns SCSI_MLQUEUE_DEVICE_BUSY
    
    From: 	Heiko Carstens <Heiko.Carstens@de.ibm.com>
    
    This happened when sending out the inquiry command and the LLDD was in
    recovery for the specific LUN and returned SCSI_MLQUEUE_DEVICE_BUSY.
    Problem is that max_device_blocked gets set _after_ the inquiry command
    finished. In this specific case max_device_blocked was 0 and thus the
    device was never blocked resulting in the observed stack overflow.
    I moved the initializazion of max_device_blocked from scsi_add_lun to
    sdev_alloc_sdev and the problem is gone.

    [PATCH] alpha fp-emu vs module refcounting
    
    From: Ivan Kokshaysky <ink@jurassic.park.msu.ru>
    
    This allows building the math-emu code as a module only when
    CONFIG_SMP is not set. The fp trap handler cannot be preempted
    on a single-CPU (as CONFIG_PREEMPT is not going to be supported
    on alpha), so the module can be safely unloaded at any time.

    [PATCH] Fix reiserfs inode size update race
    
    reiserfs_file_write unlocks the pages it operated on before updating
    i_size.  This can lead to races with writepage, who checks i_size when
    deciding how much of the file to zero out.
    
    This patch also replaces SetPageReferenced with mark_page_accessed() in
    reiserfs_file_write
    
    This was verified to fix the BitKeeper data corruption problems that
    Steven Cole has been debugging, where concurrent writes to a file and
    writebacks to disk would cause zeroes in the file when CONFIG_PREEMPT
    was enabled.

    [PCMCIA] Convert IO resource allocation to use struct resource.
    
    This causes PCMCIA to use struct resource internally for IO resources.
    This means that we can keep track of the resource pointer, expand
    this resource if necessary, and use release_resource() on it when
    we're done.
    
    This eventually means that we can change these to normal resources
    which aren't marked busy.

    this patch adds temporary fix for 0-length requests (e.g. SMBUS_QUICK) to PPC4xx

    just restores previous driver version behavior making SMBUS_QUICK-based bus scan
    at least partially usable. This is temporary kludge until correct bit-banging
    emulation is implemented.

    [PATCH] ppc64: fix rtas error log location
    
    From: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>
    
    From: Nathan Lynch <nathanl@austin.ibm.com>
    
    Somehow we've been placing the rtas error_log file at /proc/ppc64/error_log,
    which breaks at least one application I know of.  It is supposed to be at
    /proc/ppc64/rtas/error_log (this is the 2.4 behavior).

    [PATCH] ppc32: Handle altivec assist exception properly
    
    From: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>
    
    On machines with Altivec (i.e.  G4 and G5 processors), the altivec
    floating-point instructions can operate in two modes: one where
    denormalized inputs or outputs are truncated to zero, and one where they
    aren't.  In the latter mode the processor can take an exception when it
    encounters denormalized floating-point inputs or outputs rather than
    dealing with them in hardware.
    
    This patch adds code to deal properly with the exception, by emulating the
    instruction that caused the exception.  Previously the kernel just switched
    the altivec unit into the truncate-to-zero mode, which works but is a bit
    gross.  Fortunately there are only a limited set of altivec instructions
    which can generate the assist exception, so we don't have to emulate the
    whole altivec instruction set.
    
    This patch also makes sure that we always have a handler for the altivec
    unavailable exception.  Without this, if you run a kernel that is not
    configured for altivec support on a machine with altivec, it works fine
    until a user process tries to execute an altivec instruction.  At that
    point the kernel thinks it has taken an unknown exception and panics.  With
    this patch it sends a SIGILL to the process instead.

    It deletes trailing blanks and tabs in several places and joins two lines

    [PATCH] ppc32: IBM PowerPC 750GX Support
    
    From: Benjamin Herrenschmidt <benh@kernel.crashing.org>
    
    From: Bryan Rittmeyer <bryan@staidm.org>
    
    This patch adds preliminary support for the IBM PowerPC 750GX.  In summary
    this part is a PPC750FX ramped to 1 GHz with a 1MB 4-way L2 and more
    advanced I/O pipelining.  It is beginning to appear in embedded systems and
    was rumored to be under evaluation inside Apple.  Tested on PVR 70020101;
    please merge.

    NTFS: Add a new address space operations struct, ntfs_mst_aops, for mst
          protected attributes.  This is because the default ntfs_aops do not
          make sense with mst protected data and were they to write anything to
          such an attribute they would cause data corruption so we provide
          ntfs_mst_aops which does not have any write related operations set.

    Patch from: Ian Campbell
    
    This changes the atomic_t in struct page named count into a private
    member _count which breaks arch/arm/mm/init.c at line 80 which reads
    page->count directly in show_mem().
    
    The comments in the above changeset suggest that page_count(page) is
    precisely equal to the old page->count semantics, even though the
    semantics of _count are different, so I think the following is correct

    [PATCH] USB: ethernet/rndis gadget address params
    
    This resolves a FIXME by adding module parameters that can
    be used to provide stable (vs random) addresses, and gets
    rid of a runtime error from obsolete module parameter usage
    in the RNDIS code.
    
    The stable ethernet addresses are nice to hosts, which will
    normally want to save them away in config databases.  For
    example, without stable addresses Windows XP will end up
    recording quite a lot of RNDIS devices.

    [PATCH] USB: RNDIS (and CDC) filter flag handling
    
    This should fix the problem David Meggy found, where RNDIS was setting
    the OID_GEN_CURRENT_PACKET_FILTER state incorrectly.  It's the same
    issue Andrew Morton noticed a while back, for that matter, but with
    more than just a "now compiles on 64 bit" fix.
    
    Basically the code needs to interpret 32 bits provided in the request
    from the (Windows) host, rather than 8 bits of other memory that's got
    some irrelevant value.
    
    The fix is just to save the 32 bits.  I did the same thing with the
    CDC Ethernet filter, which should eventually be used the same way:  to
    limit what packets get sent to the host.  Also defined a couple more
    of the CDC requests.

    [PATCH] fix-sysfs-symlinks.patch
    
    - Rediffed the patch for 2.6.6-mm3 to fix rejects in the latest changes
      in sysfs code.
    
    o The symlinks code in sysfs doesnot point to the correct target kobject
      whenever target kobject is renamed and suffers from dangling symlinks
      if target kobject is removed.
    
    o The following patch implements ->readlink and ->follow_link operations
      for sysfs instead of using the page_symlink_inode_operations.
      The pointer to target kobject is saved in the link dentry's d_fsdata field.
      The target path is generated everytime we do ->readlink and ->follow_link.
      This results in generating the correct target path during readlink and
      follow_link operations inspite of renamed target kobject.
    
    o This also pins the target kobject during link creation and the ref. is
      released when the link is removed.
    
    o Apart from being correct this patch also saves some memory by not pinning
      a whole page for saving the target information.
    
    o Used a rw_semaphor sysfs_rename_sem to avoid clashing with renaming of
      ancestors while the target path is generated.
    
    o Used dcache_lock in fs/sysfs/sysfs.h:sysfs_get_kobject() because of using
      d_drop() while removing dentries.

    [libata] replace ATA_QCFLAG_ATAPI with inline helper
    
    Detection of an ATAPI taskfile is possible using a simple test
    on existing information, so there is no need to cache this value
    in a separate flag (ATA_QCFLAG_ATAPI).  Instead, create and use
    a new helper function is_atapi_taskfile().

      complete these commands with success.
    * MODE SENSE caching page work:
    	* correct page length
    	* set bit, if read-ahead is disabled
    	* set bit, if writeback caching is enabled
    	  (previously, this bit was never set, even if
    	   writeback caching was enabled)
    * add MODE SENSE r/w error recovery page

    [libata] SCSI->ATA simulator hacking: INQUIRY command
    
    The SCSI T10 committee is working on a document describing a standard
    method for translating ATA<->SCSI, since it being done quite often
    these days.  Some of the recommendations are reasonable, and we implement
    two here:
    
    * Mirror that ATA 'removeable media' bit into INQUIRY output.
    * Change behavior of INQUIRY output field 'product revision' from
      the libata software version number to the first 4 bytes of the
      ATA device's firmware revision number.
    
    Rather than cache the firmware revision in struct ata_device, as was/is
    done with two other strings, I took the opportunity to eliminate the
    caching of the two other strings, 'vendor' and 'product'.  These strings
    are now retrieved as needed from the IDENTIFY [PACKET] DEVICE info page,
    since we cache its entire contents.
    
    Retrieving a string from the identify-device page is done via the
    helper function ata_dev_id_string(), which is now exported.
    
    This patch winds up making struct ata_device 40 bytes smaller, and
    the libata core gets a bit smaller as well.

    [libata] remove redundant use of ATA_QCFLAG_SG in ATAPI packet translation
    
    ata_scsi_translate() sets this flag for all ATA->SCSI translated
    commands, so it need not be done in atapi_xlat().  The now-removed
    use in atapi_xlat() was also inconsistent WRT PIO versus DMA.

    [libata] DMADIR support
    
    DMADIR bit is necessary for some PATA->SATA bridges.  These
    bridges require the OS driver to specify the data xfer direction,
    for PACKET (a.k.a. scsi) commands.
    
    A reliable DMADIR detection method hasn't yet been developed,
    and ATAPI is still a WIP, so DMADIR is enabled with an ifdef for
    now.

    [SERIAL] Remove base_baud default from 8250_pci
    
    Since all boards specify base_baud, the code to default base_baud to
    the architecture-defined BASE_BAUD is redundant.  Also, defaulting
    to the architecture-defined BASE_BAUD is wrong since the UARTs on a
    serial PCI card will be clocked at the same rate no matter what the
    architecture of the host machine.

    [ARM] Convert execve() to be a function rather than a SWI call.
    
    This eliminates the last SWI user from the kernel - now all SWI calls
    will only come from userspace.  More importantly, this also allows us
    to empty the kernel stack when starting userspace programs from
    kernelspace, thereby ensuring that the user registers always appear
    at the top of the kernel stack.

    [CPUFREQ] Sync p4-clockmod MSR access across logical CPUs.
    As noted and debugged by Rutger Nijlunsing and verified in section 13.15.3 of Intel's
    IA32 Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual, Volume 3, the p4-clockmod
    msr needs to be set to the same value on all logical CPUs ("siblings") to
    function "properly".
    
    This patch implements this, and uses cpufreq_p4_get instead of a local copy in
    cpufreq_p4_setdc. The latter function now only does the actual setting, all
    other (notification, verification and set_cpus_allowed()) stuff is done in
    cpufreq_p4_target.

    [netdrvr b44] better reset behavior
    
    This patch makes the b44-after-bcm4400 scenario work for
    me. What was happening is that the broadcom driver sets a "power off MAC"
    bit, and we didn't remove that when initializing the chip.
    Also added some (a bit ugly, I know  ) logic to clear up the address
    filter stuff, which is what recent broadcom drivers do...

    [PATCH] alpha: fix GP-load symbol linkage
    
    From: Ivan Kokshaysky <ink@jurassic.park.msu.ru>
    
    This skips the GP-loading function prologue (two instructions: 8 bytes)
    on BRSGP linkage correctly, fixing an oops on alpha while loading the
    aic7xxx driver.

    We need to use "memset_io()" when accessing PCI
    mapped memory.
    
    A regular "memset()" may be using cache control
    instructions etc, which is not appropriate for
    memory-mapped IO.
    
    This also fixes a warning.

    Fix the xscale cache handling routines that were invalidating a D

    Unlike the v5 architecture, the ARM1136 requires that BIT4 is 0 in
    the first level page descriptor (ARM1136 TRM, page 6-39). It works
    at the moment but it might break future v6 cores.

    The _raw_write_(try)lock functions in include/asm-arm/spinlock.h
    
    should use the early clobber modifier (&) for the "tmp" register.
    
    A newer compiler (gcc-3.4.0) generates an "strexeq %0, %1, [%2]"

    [libata] internal cleanups
    
    Remove unused 'done_late' arg to ata_qc_complete(), which was never
    useful in 2.4, and never used at all in 2.6.
    
    This allows us to eliminate the same arg from ata_dma_complete(),
    and also make it more correct by passing the command rather than
    the ATA port structure as arg0.

    [PATCH] ide-disk.c: more write cache fixes
    
    - many Maxtor disks incorrectly claim CACHE FLUSH EXT command support,
      fix it by checking both CACHE FLUSH EXT command and LBA48 support
      (thanks to Eric D. Mudama for help in fixing this)
    
    - write_cache() was called with 'drive->id->cfs_enable_2 & 0x3000' as 'int arg'
      argument which was always truncated to zero due to 'u8 drive->wcache = arg'
      assignment so write cache was indeed enabled but drive->wcache was zero
      (thanks to Rene Herman for help in debugging this)
    
    - flush cache in idedisk_start_power_step() only if ATA-6 CACHE FLUSH (EXT)
      bits are present in disk's identify data (prevents sending unknown commands)
    
    - set drive->wcache in idedisk_setup() not idedisk_attach() (no need to check
      id->command_set_2 - we check id->cfs_enable_2 instead in write_cache() call)
    
    - use ide_cacheflush_p() in idedisk_setup()
    
    - minor cleanups

    [PATCH] Handle empty nodes in sysfs on x86-64
    
    This code is shared between i386 and x86-64, and x86-64 needs to check
    for empty nodes here.  Otherwise you can get oopses at boot in some
    circumstances.
    
    This handles empty nodes != 0; empty node zero are still broken in other
    ways.

    [PATCH] x86-64: fix /dev/mem caching behaviour
    
    This changes the /dev/mem caching behaviour on x86-64 to be compatible
    with i386.
    
    By default everything is set cached.
    
    This actually makes WC MTRRs on AMD systems work, which would get
    overriden by the UC PAT bits that were set earlier.  This can make DVD
    decoding with hardware support a lot faster.
    
    It also supports O_SYNC now, like i386, although that is not really
    safe, because it allows the user to create undefined cache attribute
    conflicts that can corrupt caches in some circumstances.  I kept it for
    now.  Better would to disallow it, until Terrence Ripperda's PAT
    framework is getting merged, that can avoid these problems.
    
    Actually it would be probably a good idea to add a printk here to catch
    broken programs for i386 and x86-64, but that is for another patch.

    [PATCH] x86-64 updates
    
    Various accumulated x86-64 patches and bug fixes.
    
    It fixes one nasty bug that has been there since NX is used by
    default in the kernel. With heavy AGP memory allocation it would
    set NX on parts of the kernel mapping in some corner cases, which gave
    endless crash loops. Thanks goes to some wizards in AMD debug labs
    for getting a trace out of this.
    
    Also various other fixes. This patches only changes x86-64 specific
    files, i have some changes outside too that I am sending separately.

    daemon that flushes buffers that are too old) too often.  The default is once
    every second, this patch makes laptop mode do it once every 30 seconds.

    [PATCH] Fix endianess in modpost when cross-compiling for sparc on i386
    
    From: Mathieu Chouquet-Stringer <mchouque@online.fr>
    
    This patch makes the following code work again:
    
    #ifdef STT_REGISTER
                    if (info->hdr->e_machine == EM_SPARC ||
                        info->hdr->e_machine == EM_SPARCV9) {
                            /* Ignore register directives. */
                            if (ELF_ST_TYPE(sym->st_info) == STT_REGISTER)
                                    break;
                    }
    #endif
    
    This portion of code is sparc specific and nothing else in modpost.c uses
    e_machine meaning cross-compiling for sparc on i386 (or any little endian
    machine) is the only way to experience the bug.
    
    Without it, e_machine has the wrong value and modpost then generates a lot
    of "*** Warning: \"symbol\" [filename.ko] undefined" messages.

    The patch below resolves the "Not Yet Implemented" print_modules() thing.
    This is a really useful feature for distros; it allows us to do statistical
    analysis on which modules are present how often in oopses compared to how
    often they are used normally.  In addition it helps to spot candidates for
    certain bugs without having to go back to the customer asking for this
    information.

    [PATCH] fix block layer ioctl bug
    
    From: Alan Cox <alan@redhat.com>
    
    The block layer checks for -EINVAL from block layer driver ioctls.  This is
    wrong - ENOTTY is unknown and some drivers correctly use this.  I suspect
    for an internal ioctl 2.7 should change to -ENOIOCTLCMD and bitch about old
    style returns
    
    This is conservative fix for the 2.6 case, it keeps the bogus -EINVAL to
    avoid breaking stuff

    [PATCH] calculate NGROUPS_PER_BLOCK from PAGE_SIZE
    
    From: Greg Edwards <edwardsg@sgi.com>
    
    On ia64, EXEC_PAGESIZE (max page size) is 65536, but the default page size is
    16k.  This results in NGROUPS_PER_BLOCK in include/linux/sched.h being
    calculated incorrectly when the page size is anything other than 64k.  For
    example, on a 16k page size kernel, a setgroups() call with a gidsetsize of
    65536 will end up walking over memory since only 1/4 of the needed pages were
    allocated for the blocks[] array in the group_info struct.
    
    Patch below calculates NGROUPS_PER_BLOCK from PAGE_SIZE instead.

    checking XFS_HZ.

    [PATCH] expose backing dev max read-ahead
    
    From: Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>
    
    Expose the blockdev's VM readahead in /sys/block/hda/queue/read_ahead_kbytes
    
    This duplicates `blockdev --setra', but we're trying to get away from
    ioctls.
    
    It would be nice to have a readahead-setting mechanism which also allows,
    say, NFS to be tuned.  But there is no common exposure point for
    backing_dev_infos.  One option might be per-superblock:
    
    	mount -o remount,read_ahead_kbytes=64
    
    but the generic remount code also has no visibility of the backing_dev, so it
    would need a new super_block operation.  One which doesn't accidentally modify
    default_backing_dev_info.

    [PATCH] show last kernel-image symbol in /proc/kallsyms
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    The current code doesn't show the last symbol (usually _einittext) in
    /proc/kallsyms.  The reason for this is subtle: s_start() returns an empty
    string for position 0 (ignored by s_show()), and s_next() returns the first
    symbol for position 1.
    
    What should happen is that update_iter() for position 0 should fill in the
    first symbol.  Unfortunately, the get_ksymbol_core() fills in the symbol
    information, *and* updates the iterator: we have to split these functions,
    which we do by making it return the length of the name offset.
    
    Then we can call get_ksymbol_core() without moving the iterator, meaning
    that we can call it at position 0 (ie.  s_start()).

     tdfxfb_cursor() was not used before, causing a compiler warning.
     tdfxfb_cursor() may work, but we don't know, so we didn't dare to enable it
     by default.  Now the user (he who has the hardware) can enable it, and tell
     us whether it works or not.

    [PATCH] autofs4 race fix
    
    From: Ian Kent <raven@themaw.net>
    
    The case where two process similtaneously trigger a mount in autofs4 can
    cause multiple requests to the daemon for the same mount.  The daemon
    handles this OK but it's possible an incorrect error to be returned.  For
    this reason I believe it is better to change the spin lock to a semaphore
    in waitq.c.  This makes the second and subsequent request wait on the q as
    ther supposed to.

    [PATCH] autofs4: readdir fixes
    
    From: Ian Kent <raven@themaw.net>
    
    a. Implement readdir and friends for directory lookup for late mounting.
       This is done largely by replacing a catch all condition in
       try_to_fill_dentry with appropriate cases.
    
    b. Add path calc.  function in waitq.c to get extended path to return to
       daemon (for direct mounts).
    
    c. Add revalidate calls to sys_chdir and sys_chroot so that pwd lookups
       work correctly.
    
    d. Add ioctl to retrieve minor version for automount daemon (and me) to
       recognise module fix level.  Bumped minor version to 5.
    
    From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
    
      After chdir (or chroot) to non-existent directory on 2.6.5-mm5, you can no
      longer unmount filesystem holding working directory (or root).

    [PATCH] autofs4: expiry refcount fixes
    
    From: Ian Kent <raven@themaw.net>
    
    This patch is the result of an e-mail discussion with Soni Maneesh.  He felt
    that the use of reference counts in the expire module is unreliable (in the
    presence of rcu) and suggested it should use standard VFS calls where
    possible.  This has been done.  Once the boundary in autofs is reached we
    have no choice but to resort using reference counts (but under the
    vfsmount_lock).
    
    
    After review by hch:
    
    - renamed autofs4_may_umount to __may_umount_tree, made it static and moved
      it to namespace.c.
    
    - added stub function may_umount_tree with description
    
    - altered may_umount to use above stub function and added little description
    
    - added may_umount_tree prototype to fs.h
    
    - removed the EXPORT_SYMBOL for vfsmount_lock
    
    - updated expire.c to suit

    [PATCH] autofs4: locking rework
    
    From: Ian Kent <raven@themaw.net>
    
    Remove BKL from autofs4 module and add spinlock to serialise access to the
    automount daemon communication waitq.
    
    Locking requirements are different in 2.6 and so I'm seeking comments and
    suggestions on this.  I have taken a rather heavy handed approach to this in
    the patch.  For example, the VFS operations that directly change the
    filesystem, such as autofs4_mkdir etc, hold the inode semaphore on entry so
    the BKL has been removed.  I can't see why two locking mechanisms are needed.
     Rather than add locking all over the place, I'm looking for justification
    it's needed, as I don't see it myself.

    [PATCH] autofs4: dnotify + autofs may create signal/restart syscall loop
    
    From: Ian Kent <raven@themaw.net>
    
    From: Jeff Mahoney <jeffm@suse.com>
    
    I saw a recent bug report that showed when a process set up a dnotify
    against the autofs root and then attempted an access(2) call inside the
    autofs namespace on a mount that would fail, it would create a
    signal/restart loop.
    
    The cause is that the autofs code checks to see if any signals are pending
    after it waits on a response from the autofs daemon.  If it finds any, it
    assumes that autofs_wait was interrupted, and that it should return
    -ERESTARTNOINTR.  The problem with this is that a signal_pending(current)
    check will return true if *any* signals were received, not just if a signal
    that interrupted the wait was received.  autofs_wait explicitly blocks all
    signals except for SIGKILL, SIGQUIT, and SIGINT before calling
    interruptible_sleep_on.
    
    The effect is that if a dnotify is set against the autofs root, when the
    autofs daemon creates the directory, a dnotify event will be sent to the
    originating process.  Since the code in autofs_root_lookup doesn't check to
    see what signals are actually pending, it bails early, telling the caller
    to try again.  The loop goes on forever until interrupted via one of the
    actual interrupting signals.
    
    The following patch makes both autofs_root_lookup and autofs4_root_lookup
    verify that one of its defined "shutdown" signals are pending before
    bailing out early.  Any other signal should be delivered later, as
    expected.  It doesn't matter if the signal occured outside of the sleep in
    autofs_wait.  The calling process will either go away or try again.

    [PATCH] sched: reduce node balancing interval
    
    From: Nick Piggin <nickpiggin@yahoo.com.au>
    
    From: Suresh Siddha <suresh.b.siddha@intel.com>
    
    Node max rebalance interval is too large.  It is currently dependent on
    number of online cpus.  For 16 cpu system, max node balance interval in
    busy case is 32 seconds.  Agreed that it will use max 32 seconds only when
    it doesn't find imbalance for a long time.  But this will lead to slow
    response time in cases where load runs for a second with no imbalance and
    suddently creates an imbalance.  My patch makes the busy max node rebalance
    interval equal to the base [scheduler].

    [PATCH] sched: fix scheduler for unsynched processor sched_clock
    
    From: Nick Piggin <nickpiggin@yahoo.com.au>
    
    Fine-tune the unsynched sched_clock handling.
    
    Basically, you need to be careful about ensuring timestamps get correctly
    adjusted when moving CPUs, and you *can't* look at your unadjusted
    sched_clock() and a remote task's ->timestamp and try to come up with
    anything meaningful.
    
    I think this second problem will really hit hard in the activate_task path
    on systems with unsynched sched_clock when you're waking up a remote task,
    which happens very often.  Andi, I thought some Opterons have unsynched
    tscs?  Maybe this is causing your unexplained bad interactivity?
    
    Another problem is a fixup in pull_task.  When adjusting ->timestamp from
    one processor to another, you must use timestamp_last_tick for the local
    processor too.  Using sched_clock() will cause ->timestamp to creep
    forward.
    
    A final small fix is for sync wakeups.  They were using __activate_task for
    some reason, thus they don't get credited for sleeping at all AFAIKS.
    
    And another thing, do we want to #ifdef timestamp_last_tick so it doesn't
    show on UP?

    [PATCH] Multiple (ICH3) IDE-controllers in a system
    
    This fixes a problem with multiple IDE controllers in a system.
    
    The problem is that pcibios_fixups table (in arch/i386/pci/fixup.c) uses
    the pci_fixup_ide_trash() quirk for Intel's ICH3 (my case specifically
    8086:248b).  This clears any bogus BAR information set up by the BIOS.
    
    In a system which has multiple ICH3's can't use any of the IDE
    controllers beside the one on the first ICH3.
    
    Anyhow, the fix is to make sure pci_fixup_ide_trash resets the BARs only
    for first time being called, so the subsequent IDE controllers will use
    the BIOS BARs.  This is better than "loosing" all these IDE controllers
    in the case their BARs set right.
    
    The issue discussed and agreed with Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz (see below).

    Also, move open-coded tests for "new ICH" audio chips to a single
    helper function.  These tests were being patched with each new
    ICH motherboard from Intel, resulting in each new PCI id being added
    to several places in the driver.
    
    Note that, even though this should be a harmless patch, there
    exists the remote possibility that I mis-matched some of the
    PCI ids, as I only tested ICH5.

    [PATCH] x86_64 has buggy ffs() implementation
    
    x86_64 has an incorrect ffs() implementation.  The asm uses "g" instead
    of "rm" for the bsfl instruction.  (This was spotted by Yuri Per.)
    
    bsfl does not accept constant values but only memory or register ones.
    On i386 the correct "rm" is used.
    
    This causes NTFS build to fail as gcc optimizes a variable into a
    constant and ffs() then fails to assemble.

    [PATCH] ppc64: strengthen I/O and memory barriers
    
    From: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>
    
    After I sent the recent patch to include/asm-ppc64/io.h which put stronger
    barriers in the I/O accessor macros, Paul McKenney pointed out to me that a
    writex/outx could still slide out from inside a spinlocked region.  This patch
    makes the barriers a bit stronger so that this can't happen.  It means that we
    need to use a sync instruction for wmb (a full "heavyweight" sync), since
    drivers rely on wmb for ordering between writes to system memory and writes to
    a device.
    
    I have left smb_wmb() as a lighter-weight barrier that orders stores, and
    doesn't impose an ordering between cacheable and non-cacheable accesses (the
    amusingly-named eieio instruction).  I am assuming here that smp_wmb is only
    used for ordering stores to system memory so that another cpu will see them in
    order.  It can't be used for enforcing any ordering that a device will see,
    because it is just a gcc barrier on UP.
    
    This also changes the spinlock/rwlock unlock code to use lwsync ("light-weight
    sync") rather than eieio, since eieio doesn't order loads, and we need to
    ensure that loads stay inside the spinlocked region.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Kconfig bits for CONFIG_SPINLINE
    
    From: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>
    
    When I sent the patch to uninline the spinlocks, I inadvertently left out
    the change to arch/ppc64/Kconfig which defines the config symbol for
    inlining the locks (CONFIG_SPINLINE now).  This patch adds it.  It also
    adds a symbol CONFIG_PPC_SPLPAR which enables the code for calling the
    hypervisor on shared-processor logically-partitioned system to yield the
    physical processor to the lock holder when spinning.  (The code that
    depends on this symbol is already present in arch/ppc64/lib/locks.c.)

    [PATCH] Add del_single_shot_timer()
    
    From: Geoff Gustafson <geoff@linux.jf.intel.com>,
          "Chen, Kenneth W" <kenneth.w.chen@intel.com>,
          Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>,
          me.
    
    The big-SMP guys are seeing high CPU load due to del_timer_sync()'s
    inefficiencies.  The callers are fs/aio.c and schedule_timeout().
    
    We note that neither of these callers' timer handlers actually re-add the
    timer - they are single-shot.
    
    So we don't need all that complexity in del_timer_sync() - we can just run
    del_timer() and if that worked we know the timer is dead.
    
    Add del_single_shot_timer(), export it to modules and use it in AIO and
    schedule_timeout().
    
    
    (these numbers are for an earlier patch, but they'll be close)
    
    Before:             32p     4p
         Warm cache   29,000    505
         Cold cache   37,800   1220
    
    After:              32p     4p
         Warm cache       95     88
         Cold cache    1,800    140
    
    [Measurements are CPU cycles spent in a call to del_timer_sync, the average
    of 1000 calls. 32p is 16-node NUMA, 4p is SMP.]
    
    (I cleaned up a few things and added some commentary)

    [PATCH] dentry layout tweaks

    d_parent.
    
    Change the layout of things so that these will always be in the same
    cacheline.

    [PATCH] more dentry shrinkage
    
    - d_vfs_flags can be removed - just use d_flags.  All modifications of
      dentry->d_flags are under dentry->d_lock.
    
    On x86 this takes the internal string size up to 40 bytes.  The
    internal/external ratio on my 1.5M files hits 96%.

    [PATCH] dentry d_bucket fix
    
    The gap between checking d_bucket and sampling d_move_count looks like a bug
    to me.
    
    It feels safer to be checking d_bucket after taking the lock, when we know
    that it is stable.
    
    And it's a little faster to check d_bucket after having checked the hash
    rather than before.

    [PATCH] dentry qstr consolidation
    
    When dentries are given an external name we currently allocate an entire qstr
    for the external name.
    
    This isn't needed.  We can use the internal qstr and kmalloc only the string
    itself.  This saves 12 bytes from externally-allocated names and 4 bytes from
    the dentry itself.
    
    The saving of 4 bytes from the dentry doesn't actually decrease the dentry's
    storage requirements, but it makes four more bytes available for internal
    names, taking the internal/external ratio from 89% up to 93% on my 1.5M files.
    
    
    Fix:
    
    The qstr consolidation wasn't quite right, because it can cause qstr->len to
    be unstable during lookup lockless traverasl.
    
    Fix that up by taking d_lock earlier in lookup.  This serialises against
    d_move.
    
    Take the lock after comparing the parent and hash to preserve the
    mostly-lockless behaviour.
    
    This obsoletes d_movecount, which is removed.

    [PATCH] dentry shrinkage
    
    Rework dentries so that the inline name length is between 31 and 48 bytes.
    
    On SMP P4-compiled x86 each dentry consumes 160 bytes (24 per page).
    
    Here's the histogram of name lengths on all 1.5M files on my workstation:
    
    1:  0%
    2:  0%
    3:  1%

    60:  99%
    61:  99%
    62:  99%
    63:  99%
    64:  99%
    
    So on x86 we'll fit 89% of filenames into the inline name.
    
    
    The patch also removes the NAME_ALLOC_LEN() rounding-up of the storage for the
    out-of-line names.  That seems unnecessary.

    From: Ashok Raj <ashok.raj@intel.com>
    
    Supports basic ability to enable hotplug functions for IA64.
    Code is just evolving, and there are several loose ends to tie up.
    
    What this code drop does
    - Support logical online and offline
    - Handles interrupt migration without loss of interrupts.
    - Handles stress fine > 24+ hrs with make -j/ftp/rcp workloads
    - Handles irq migration from a dying cpu without loss of interrupts.
    
    What needs to be done
    - Boot CPU removal support, with platform level authentication
    - Putting cpu being removed in BOOT_RENDEZ mode.

    [PATCH] Revisited: ia64-cpu-hotplug-cpu_present.patch
    
    From: Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>
    
    With a hotplug capable kernel, there is a requirement to distinguish a
    possible CPU from one actually present.  The set of possible CPU numbers
    doesn't change during a single system boot, but the set of present CPUs
    changes as CPUs are physically inserted into or removed from a system.  The
    cpu_possible_map does not change once initialized at boot, but the
    cpu_present_map changes dynamically as CPUs are inserted or removed.
    
    
    Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com> provided an expanded explanation:
    
    
    Ashok's cpu hot plug patch adds a cpu_present_map, resulting in the following
    cpu maps being available.  All the following maps are fixed size bitmaps of
    size NR_CPUS.
    
    #ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU
    	cpu_possible_map - map with all NR_CPUS bits set
    	cpu_present_map - map with bit 'cpu' set iff cpu is populated
    	cpu_online_map - map with bit 'cpu' set iff cpu available to scheduler
    #else
    	cpu_possible_map - map with bit 'cpu' set iff cpu is populated
    	cpu_present_map - copy of cpu_possible_map
    	cpu_online_map - map with bit 'cpu' set iff cpu available to scheduler
    #endif
    
    In either case, NR_CPUS is fixed at compile time, as the static size of these
    bitmaps.  The cpu_possible_map is fixed at boot time, as the set of CPU id's
    that it is possible might ever be plugged in at anytime during the life of
    that system boot.  The cpu_present_map is dynamic(*), representing which CPUs
    are currently plugged in.  And cpu_online_map is the dynamic subset of
    cpu_present_map, indicating those CPUs available for scheduling.
    
    If HOTPLUG is enabled, then cpu_possible_map is forced to have all NR_CPUS
    bits set, otherwise it is just the set of CPUs that ACPI reports present at
    boot.
    
    If HOTPLUG is enabled, then cpu_present_map varies dynamically, depending on
    what ACPI reports as currently plugged in, otherwise cpu_present_map is just a
    copy of cpu_possible_map.
    
    (*) Well, cpu_present_map is dynamic in the hotplug case.  If not hotplug,
        it's the same as cpu_possible_map, hence fixed at boot.

    [PATCH] swap speedups and fix
    
    From: Andrea Arcangeli <andrea@suse.de>
    
    I don't think we need an install_swap_bdev/remove_swap_bdev anymore, we should
    use the swap_info->bdev, not the swap_bdevs.  the swap_info already has a
    ->bdev field, the only point of remove_swap_bdev/install_swap_bdev was to
    unplug all devices as efficiently as possible, we don't need that anymore with
    the page parameter.
    
    Plus the semaphore should be a rwsem to allow parallel unplug from multiple
    pages.
    
    After that I don't need to take the semaphore anymore during swapon, no
    swapcache with swp_type() pointing to such bdev, will be allowed until swapon
    is complete (SWP_ACTIVE is set a lot later after setting p->bdev).
    
    In swapoff I only need a dummy serialization with the readers, after
    try_to_unuse is complete:
    
     	err = try_to_unuse(type);
     	current->flags &= ~PF_SWAPOFF;
    
     	/* wait for any unplug function to finish */
     	down_write(&swap_unplug_sem);
     	up_write(&swap_unplug_sem);
    
    
    that's all, no other locking and no install_swap_bdev/remove_swap_bdev.
    
    (and the swap_bdevs[] compression code was busted)

    [PATCH] filtered wakeups: apply to buffer_head functions
    
    From: William Lee Irwin III <wli@holomorphy.com>
    
    This patch implements wake-one semantics for buffer_head wakeups in a single
    step.  The buffer_head being waited on is passed to the waiter's wakeup
    function by the waker, and the wakeup function compares that to the a pointer
    stored in its on-stack structure and checking the readiness of the bit there
    also.  Wake-one semantics are achieved by using WQ_FLAG_EXCLUSIVE in the
    codepaths waiting to acquire the bit for mutual exclusion.

    [PATCH] filtered wakeups: apply to pagecache functions
    
    From: William Lee Irwin III <wli@holomorphy.com>
    
    This patch implements wake-one semantics for page wakeups in a single step.
    Discrimination between distinct pages is achieved by passing the page to the
    wakeup function, which compares it to a pointer in its own on-stack structure
    containing the waitqueue element and the page.  Bit discrimination is achieved
    by storing the bit number in that same structure and testing the bit in the
    wakeup function.  Wake-one semantics are achieved by using WQ_FLAG_EXCLUSIVE
    in the codepaths waiting to acquire the bit for mutual exclusion.

    [PATCH] filtered wakeups
    
    From: William Lee Irwin III <wli@holomorphy.com>
    
    This patch series is solving the "thundering herd" problem that occurs in the
    mainline implementation of hashed waitqueues.  There are two sources of
    spurious wakeups in such arrangements:
    
    (a) Hash collisions that place waiters on different objects on the same
        waitqueue, which wakes threads falsely when any of the objects hashed to
        the same queue receives a wakeup.  i.e.  loss of information about which
        object a wakeup event is related to.
    
    (b) Loss of information about which object a given waiter is waiting on.
        This precludes wake-one semantics for mutual exclusion scenarios.  For
        instance, a lock bit may be slept on.  If there are any waiters on the
        object, a lock bit release event must wake at least one of them so as to
        prevent deadlock.  But without information as to which waiter is waiting
        on which object, we must resort to waking all waiters who could possibly
        be waiting on it.  Now, as the lock bit provides mutual exclusion, only
        one of the waiters woken can proceed, and the remainder will go back to
        sleep and wait for another event, creating unnecessary system load.  Once
        wake-one semantics are established, only one of the waiters waiting to
        acquire a lock bit need to be woken, which measurably reduces system load
        and improves efficiency (i.e.  it's the subject of the benchmarking I've
        been sending to you).
    
    Even beyond the measurable efficiency gains, there are reasons of robustness
    and responsiveness to motivate addressing the issue of thundering herds.  In a
    real-life scenario I've been personally involved in resolving, the thundering
    herd issue caused powerful modern SMP machines with fast IO systems to be
    unresponsive to user input for a minute at a time or more.  Analogues of these
    patches for the distro kernels involved fully resolved the issue to the
    customer's satisfaction and obviated workarounds to limit the pagecache's
    size.
    
    The latest spin of these patches basically shoves more pieces of the logic
    into the wakeup functions, with some efficiency gains from sharing the hot
    codepath with the rest of the kernel, and a slightly larger diff than the
    patches with the newly-introduced entrypoint.  Writing these was motivated by
    the push to insulate sched.c from more of the details of wakeup semantics by
    putting more of the logic into the wakeup functions.  In order to accomplish
    this while still solving (b), the wakeup functions grew a new argument for
    communication about what object a wakeup event is related to to be passed by
    the waker.
    
    =========
    
    This patch provides an additional argument to wakeup functions so that
    information may be passed from the waker to the waiter.  This is provided as a
    separate patch so that the overhead of the additional argument can be measured
    in isolation.  No change in performance was observable here.

    [PATCH] MSEC_TO_JIFFIES consolidation
    
    From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
    
    We have various different implementations of MSEC[S]_TO_JIFFIES and
    JIFFIES_TO_MSEC[S].  We recently had a compile-time clash in USB.
    
    Fix all that up.
    
    - The SCTP version was very inefficient.  Hopefully this version is accurate
      enough.
    
    - Optimise for the HZ=100 and HZ=1000 cases
    
    - This version does round-up, so sleep(9 milliseconds) works OK on 100HZ.
    
    - We still have lots of jiffies_to_msec and msec_to_jiffies implementations.
    
    From: William Lee Irwin III <wli@holomorphy.com>
    
      Optimize the cases where HZ is a divisor of 1000 or vice-versa in
      JIFFIES_TO_MSECS() and MSECS_TO_JIFFIES() by allowing the nonvanishing(!)
      integral ratios to appear as a parenthesized expressions eligible for
      constant folding optimizations.
    
    From: me
    
      Use typesafe inlines for the jiffies-to-millisecond conversion functions.
    
      This means that milliseconds officially takes the type `unsigned int'.
      All current callers seem to be OK with that.
    
      Drivers need to be fixed up to use this instead of their private versions.

    [PATCH] Fix page double-freeing race
    
    This has been there for nearly two years.  See bugzilla #1403
    
    vmscan.c does, in two places:
    
    	spin_lock(zone->lru_lock)
    	page = lru_to_page(&zone->inactive_list);
    	if (page_count(page) == 0) {
    		/* erk, it's being freed by __page_cache_release() or
    		 * release_pages()
    		 */
    		put_it_back_on_the_lru();
    
    	} else {
    
    	--> window 1 <--
    
    		page_cache_get(page);
    		put_in_on_private_list();
    	}
    	spin_unlock(zone->lru_lock)
    
    	use_the_private_list();
    
    	page_cache_release(page);
    
    
    
    whereas __page_cache_release() and release_pages() do:
    
    	if (put_page_testzero(page)) {
    
    	--> window 2 <--
    
    		spin_lock(lru->lock);
    		if (page_count(page) == 0) {
    			remove_it_from_the_lru();
    			really_free_the_page()
    		}
    		spin_unlock(zone->lru_lock)
    	}
    
    
    The race occurs if the vmscan.c path sees page_count()==1 and then the
    page_cache_release() path happens in that few-instruction "window 1" before
    vmscan's page_cache_get().
    
    The page_cache_release() path does put_page_testzero(), which returns true.
    Then this CPU takes an interrupt...
    
    The vmscan.c path then does page_cache_get(), taking the refcount to one.
    Then it uses the page and does page_cache_release(), taking the refcount to
    zero and the page is really freed.
    
    Now, the CPU running page_cache_release() returns from the interrupt, takes
    the LRU lock, sees the page still has a refcount of zero and frees it again.
    Boom.
    
    
    The patch fixes this by closing "window 1".  We provide a
    "get_page_testone()" which grabs a ref on the page and returns true if the
    refcount was previously zero.  If that happens the vmscan.c code simply drops
    the page's refcount again and leaves the page on the LRU.
    
    All this happens under the zone->lru_lock, which is also taken by
    __page_cache_release() and release_pages(), so the vmscan code knows that the
    page has not been returned to the page allocator yet.
    
    
    In terms of implementation, the page counts are now offset by one: a free page
    has page->_count of -1.  This is so that we can use atomic_add_negative() and
    atomic_inc_and_test() to provide put_page_testzero() and get_page_testone().
    
    The macros hide all of this so the public interpretation of page_count() and
    set_page_count() remains unaltered.
    
    The compiler can usually constant-fold the offsetting of page->count.  This
    patch increases an x86 SMP kernel's text by 32 bytes.
    
    The patch renames page->count to page->_count to break callers who aren't
    using the macros.
    
    This patch requires that the architecture implement atomic_add_negative().  It
    is currently present on
    
    	arm
    	arm26
    	i386
    	ia64
    	mips
    	ppc
    	s390
    	v850
    	x86_64
    
    ppc implements this as
    
    #define atomic_add_negative(a, v)	(atomic_add_return((a), (v)) < 0)
    
    and atomic_add_return() is implemented on
    
    	alpha
    	cris
    	h8300
    	ia64
    	m68knommu
    	mips
    	parisc
    	ppc
    	ppc
    	ppc64
    	s390
    	sh
    	sparc
    	v850
    
    so we're looking pretty good.

    [PATCH] Implement atomic_inc_and_test() on various architectures
    
    It's easy to do when the arch provides atomic_inc_return().

    [PATCH] Implement atomic_add_negative() on various architectures
    
    Lots of architectures have atomic_add_return() and no atomic_add_negative().
    
    We can implement the latter in terms of the former.

    [netdrvr] remove rcpci driver, for Red Creek Hardware VPNs
    
    Pete Popov, the author says
    
    This driver is obsolete and broken in 2.4 (and I'm pretty sure in 2.6).
    The hardware has not been available for a while. I wrote the driver
    for 2.2 but after I left RedCreek (which went out of business),
    someone in the community updated it to 2.4, but I don't think that
    person even had the hardware to test it so the driver remained broken
    in 2.4. So my recommendation is that it's really time to remove this
    driver from the kernel tree. Just my opinion but I thought I'd share
    it with you.
    [...]
    I can't imagine that there are any users because 2.4 was broken last
    time I checked (admittedly that was a year ago).

    the drivers have been broken since pre-2.4.0, like referencing a symbol
    that was made procfs-internal in 2.3.x, haven't received maintainer
    updates for about the same period and MOD_{INC,DEC}_USE_COUNT usage that
    pretty much unfixable (inside warts of _horrible_ procfs abuse).

    OK.  I've attached a new version of the patch against linux-2.6.6.
    I'll send a patch against current lm_sensors CVS removing the extra

    Errh, I just added it to document my sloppyness.  It was never meant
    to be in the patch I sent you.  Sorry.  Removed in the attached patch.
    The style of these drivers seem to be "just working, making no noise"
    so I assume informational printk's are unwanted.

    This patch adds DID support for ICH6 and 6300ESB to i2c-i801.c(SMBus).
    In order to add this support I needed to patch pci_ids.h with the SMBus
    DID's.  To keep things orginized I renumbered the ICH6 and ESB entries
    in pci_ids.h.  I then patched the piix IDE and i810 audio drivers to
    reflect the updated #define's.  I also removed an error from irq.c;
    there was a reference to a 6300ESB DID that does not exist.

    ATA_QCFLAG_POLL completely, eliminate that in favor of testing
    ATA_NIEN bit.

      This change in theory is incorrect for Promise TX/SX4 drivers,
      since those drivers set up the Promise-specific packet in their
      ->fill_sg hook, which is now called conditionally.

    [libata] add new ->bmdma_setup hook
    
    In order to support some new taskfile protocols, particularly ATAPI,
    the setup-and-start-DMA hook needs to be split into its component
    pieces, 'setup' and 'start'.
    
    For PCI IDE-style controllers, most of the code is moved into the
    'setup' portion, with the 'start' portion only flipping a single
    bit in hardware.

    the FFUART state as this is unnecessary with the 2.6 serial

    ia64: fix spurious "timer tick before it's due" problem
    
    Patch Bjorn Helgaas: Fix the "timer tick before it's due" complaint
    from timer_interrupt().  The problem was that smp_callin() turned
    on the periodic timer tick before syncing the ITC with the BP.
    
    Syncing the ITC happens with interrupts disabled, and if you're
    unlucky enough to (1) pend a timer interrupt, and (2) set the ITC
    back before the ITM value that caused the timer interrupt, you
    can get stuck for several iterations in the following cycle
    (assume 100 clocks per tick):
    
        ITC     ITM
        ---	    ---
                        ia64_init_itm()
        100	    200	        schedule first tick at 200
                        ia64_sync_itc()
                            disable interrupts
        200     200         ITC == ITM; pend IT interrupt
        150                 set ITC to sync with BP
                            enable interrupts
                            recognize pending IT interrupt
                            disable IT interrupts
                        timer_interrupt()
        160     200         notice that 160 < 200,
                                printk "timer tick before it's due")
        200     200         ITC == ITM; pend IT interrupt
    	    300         set ITM for next tick
                            re-enable IT interrupt
                            recognize pending IT interrupt
                            disable IT interrupts
                        timer_interrupt()
        260     300         notice that 260 < 300,
                                printk "timer tick before it's due")
    
        ...	            repeat until you're tired or timer_interrupt()
                        takes long enough that the ITC lands after the
                        ITM
    
    This patch syncs the ITC with the BP before starting up the
    periodic tick, so the above scenario should never happen.
    
    This doesn't change how the timer tick on the BP is started;
    that happens quite early (and must be early because things
    like calibrate_delay() depend on jiffies updates).

    [PATCH] st.c for GET_IDLUN
    
    A little more testing of st's SG_IO ioctl turned up a
    small problem.
    
    This is the corresponding patch that was applied to the
    sd driver when it received the block layer SG_IO ioctl.
    
    For least surprise of lk 2.4 utilities that use the
    SCSI_IOCTL_GET_IDLUN and SCSI_IOCTL_GET_BUS_NUMBER
    ioctls (e.g. sg_map) it is better to return the correct
    values rather than 0.

    Of course!  I trust you won't mind me changing your suggested fix
    slightly.  This should do an equally good job of repairing things, and it
    will prevent other possible invalid references as well.

    Hi Alan, thanks for doing this.  It looks and works OK.  I added some name
    changes: all struct usb_interface pointers are now called intf; and, when
    reasonable, variables holding interface numbers are now all called ifnum.
    This drowns your original changes in a sea of churning names, I hope you
    don't mind.

    [AGPGART] Various Intel/EM64T AGP fixes.
    
    From Andi Kleen.
    
    - Add full PCI IDs to the module table for intel-agp and intel-mch-agp.
    Don't use PCI_ANY_ID for device, since the drivers cannot handle unknown
    devices anyways.
    This fixes the problems with them loading both when compiled in and
    also helps external tools that use the module PCI table to find the
    correct driver.
    - Remove wrong hack in intel-mch-agp that checked for long mode.
    EM64T capability has nothing to do with the MCH version.
    To avoid double probing the fix above is better.
    - Handle the case of no AGP capability (unlikely, but better to handle it)

    cleanup here and there, but it's to the point that it's should
    be OK to push upstream.
    
    Some of the remaining TODOs:
    
    - Cleanup GPIO IRQ handling for edge-trigered HW (none exists ATM)
    - Add IDE driver for various platforms
    - Misc cleanups
    
    This patch adds the changes to arch/arm/Makefile and arch/arm/Kconfig

    [PATCH] ia64: map display option ROMs on SN2
    
    By default, the sn2 PCI init code doesn't map option ROM address
    ranges since PIO address space is limited.  However, we do need to map
    display option ROMs in the event that userland applications want to
    read and emulate them.

    This adds PCMCIA support for Lubbock and relies on patch #1829/1.  This
    is probably the only reference board using both the PXA2xx and the SA1111
    for PCMCIA support. Other board won't need to link sa1111_generic.o.

    This patch moves things around and rename a few files/functions/structures
    to be shared with PXA2xx PCMCIA support (coming in a separate patch) and
    maybe others SOCs. No functional change were made so SA11xx users
    shouldn't see any difference.

    [PATCH] kobject/sysfs race fix
    
    The following patch fixes the race involved between unregistering a kobject
    and simultaneously opeing a corresponding attribute file in sysfs.
    
    Ideally sysfs should take a ref.  to the kobject as long as it has dentries
    referring to the kobjects, but because of current limitations in
    module/kobject ref counting, sysfs's pinning of kobject leads to
    hang/delays in rmmod of certain modules.  The patch checks for unhashed
    dentries in check_perm() while opening a sysfs file.  If the dentry is
    still hashed then it goes ahead and takes the ref to kobject.  This done
    under the per dentry lock.  It does this in the inline routine
    sysfs_get_kobject(dentry).

    [PATCH] USB: OHCI root hub suspend/resume/wakeup
    
    This patch goes on top of the previous two, and the hcd-0506 patch:
    
      - Moves root hub suspend/resume code out of PCI-specific bus glue
        into generic hub code.  That way it's easy to re-use it even
        for non-PCI implementations like SA1111, OMAP, and LH7A404.
        (Plus, given CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND, it can be invoked with sysfs.)
    
      - Root hub suspend is a lot more careful, as is root hub resume.
        Pending transactions are now shut down more consistently; and
        more registers are re-initialized on resume.
    
      - The PCI bus glue is now left with truly generic PCI stuff, plus
        some PMAC-specific stuff (which doesn't include irq disabling
        any more, hcd-0506 moves that up a level in the stack).
    
      - Remote wakeup support is basically working for the root hub.
        (given CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND to suspend devices and enable it).
    
      - Idle HCs will now automatically suspend themselves, and resume
        as necessary.  This saves a certain amount of power on most
        systems, and matches what UHCI has been doing for a while.
    
    The large size of this patch is mostly because of moving that
    root hub suspend/resume code out of the PCI-specific glue.

    [PATCH] USB: khubd turns port power back on after reset
    
    This goes with the OHCI anti-deadlock patch, and is what
    ensures that when a root hub loses power during suspend,
    khubd can turn port power back on so devices can enumerate.

    [PATCH] USB: OHCI cleanups
    
    This splits out a few obvious fixes, to help shrink a PM patch:
    
      - when the HC is quiescing, don't schedule any more EDs
        or re-activate any after unlink completion.
    
      - when the HC is suspended, don't access registers through
        sysfs either.
    
      - simplify locking and call for donelist processing

    [PATCH] USB: OHCI resume/reset stops deadlocking in PM code
    
    System-wide PM resume now happily deadlocks if one of the
    resuming devices tries to remove devices which vanished
    during the suspend(*).  IMO that's unreasonable both
    because devices can/do vanish, and because 2.4 didn't
    deadlock in those cases; but no patch to fix that has been
    merged.  The result is that ever since merging the "new" PM
    code, some OHCI-based systems deadlock on resume.
    
    So this patch handles the "lost power during resume" case
    differently:  it doesn't disconnect the root hub (or its
    children) directly.  Instead, it does part of that work
    immediately, and defers the rest to khubd:
    
      - add a "pending" list for live urbs, and use it after reset
        to abort pending URBs (and reclaim "live" EDs/TDs)
      - immediately mark all devices NOTATTACHED, so any operations
        on the devices before khubd handles the disconnects, including
        resume() callbacks, will fail
      - kick root hub so it can do the cleanup
    
    It also handles "fminterval" init/reinit a bit better, mostly
    to work better in some remote wakeup scenarios addressed in
    later patches:
    
       - save any initial value the boot firmware provided
       - use it during initialization (and eventually, remote wakeup)
    
    Other changes:
    
      - use better jiffies calculation for scheduled delays
      - the allocator does more of the one-time initialization
      - initialize hcd.can_wakeup according to boot firmware
      - move some inlines to the header
      - minor cleanups

    [PATCH] USB: fixes of assumptions about waitqueues
    
    quoting Linus:
    
    --
    > so there is no need to recheck the bit in do/while loop, because
    > there is no false wakeups now.
    
    You should never assume this. You should assume that there are _always_
    false wakeups.
    
    Why? Because Linux has always allowed people to leave wait-queues active,
    without being "atomic". For example, the tty read/write layer used to
    (still does?)  add itself on the wait-queue _once_, and then leave itself
    on the wait-queue while in a loop it does copies from/to user space.
    --
    
    Unfortunately, this means us. Here's the first fix. Comments?
    
      - make sure timeouts are observed even if somebody left us on a queue

    [PATCH] USB: more functional HCD PCI PM glue
    
    This patch makes the usbcore PCI suspend/resume logic behave
    much better.  In particular:
    
      - Even HCs without PCI PM support will normally be able
        to support global suspend, saving power ... and will
        need to resume later.  Let them try to suspend; lots
        of not-that-old USB controllers don't have PM caps.
    
      - Saner order for the boilerplate PCI stuff.  It also
        explicitly disables the IRQ and DMA, which aren't
        available in D1/D2/D3 states anyway.
    
      - Uses pci_enable_wake() when the root hub supports
        remote wakeup.  Didn't fully work in one test setup;
        that controller's PME# was evidently ignored.  (Not
        enabled unless CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND.)
    
    It worked for me with brief tests with the current 2.6.6-rc
    uhci-hcd with one old UHCI; more extensive ones with various
    OHCIs (using patches which I'll post soonish); and not at all
    with EHCI (where PM hasn't ever worked).
    
    Those of you who've been having PM problems might find
    this helpful as-is, though I think that unless you're
    using UHCI you'll also need an HCD patch.

    [PATCH] USB: Accept devices with funky interface/altsetting numbers
    
    Now that all the USB drivers have been audited, we can safely accept
    devices that have noncompliant numbering for their interfaces or
    altsettings.  This patch skips bad or duplicate descriptors, allows gaps
    in the numbering, accepts more or fewer interfaces than bNumInterfaces,
    and logs warnings describing all these things.  Also, the debugging log
    messages have been improved by David Brownell.
    
    This should please a sizeable group of users.

    [PATCH] USB: EHCI power management updates
    
    This patch updates EHCI suspend/resume so that its essential
    components work on a few different implementations:
    
       - make root hub suspend/resume work
       - make remote wakeup work (given CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND patch)
       - separate root hub suspend/resume from PCI suspend/resume
       - say if controller supports remote wakeup (on this system)
       - sysfs register dump unavailable if controller is suspended
    
    Plus a handful of minor cleanups.  Please merge, along with the
    "hcd-0506.patch" I sent last week.
    
    Tested by modifying sysfs power/state files, since ACPI doesn't
    work on this system (so I can't test system suspend/resume):
    
      - For root hub(*) ... suspend/resume works, also remote wakeup
      - PCI controller ... suspend/resume works, remote wakeup
        signals PME# (according to "lspci -vv"), but that's ignored
        on my test sytem
    
    Regardless of whether USB was active, "echo 1 > /proc/acpi/sleep"
    produced a system that wouldn't resume, and the same result
    came from "echo standby > /sys/power/state".  So that's about
    as far as I can take this testing for now.
    
    - Dave
    
    (*) Doing this relies on the CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND patch.  Otherwise
         no USB devices respond to sysfs power/state updates.  The
         PCI suspend/resume is a superset of this.

    [PATCH] PCI crash with pciless box or pci=off workaround on Vaio's
    
    From: Alan Cox <alan@redhat.com>
    
    Reasoning
    
    
    - Earlier in boot if we find a PCI bus we set raw_pci_ops to the function
      table to use for PCI accesses.
    - When we enter this function we now check if we have such a method
    - If not then we know it will otherwise crash because the call sequence
      through the code goes
    
            pci_irq_init
            pirq_peer_trick
            pci_scan_bus_parented
            which always leads down into the device scan and a pci config access
                    via raw_pci_ops
    
      The moment the scan searches for a device it has to crash as it has no
      access methods.
    
    - The other case which does nothing but pci_fixup_irqs is a no-op with no
      PCI devices
    
    - THUS any situation that is changed by the raw_pci_ops check was
      previously an oops case anyway or did nothing anyway.
    
    
    Tested with pci=off and without

    [PATCH] PCI Hotplug: fix wrong var used in hotplug/shpchp_ctrl.c.
    
    Zhenmin's checker tool <zli4@cs.uiuc.edu> detected this:
    
     9. /drivers/pci/hotplug/shpchp_ctrl.c, Line 1575:
     err("%s: Failed to disable slot, error code(%d)\n", __FUNCTION__, rc);
    
     Maybe change to:
     err("%s: Failed to disable slot, error code(%d)\n", __FUNCTION__,
     retval);
    
     I think it is right because at line 1564, the slot is turned off, and
    in this line (1575) is checked the status to see if we got an error; if
    so, the error number is shown. This number is in 'retval', not in 'rc'
    ('rc' does have the return of configure_new_device()).
    
     The patch bellow fixes that:

    [PATCH] I2C: new i2c video decoder calls: saa7111 driver
    
    Attached patch implements the i2c calls in the saa7111 driver.
    
    The driver is still compatible with old behaviour, so the zr36067 driver
    (the original user of the saa7111 module) doesn't need any changes.  I'll
    probably gradually make everything use DECODER_INIT instead of 0 (that was
    a nice hack back then) somewhere later.
    
    Can I just remove '0' later on? Or are there official ABI rules for
    stable kernel versions?

    [PATCH] I2C: new i2c video decoder calls
    
    Attached patch adds three new calls to the i2c video decoder API.  The changes
    were requested by Michael (CC'ed) and approved by Gerd Knorr (v4l maintainer,
    CC'ed).
    
    Short explanation:
    
    * INIT is a general initialization call with optional initialization data.
      Reason for this is that several i2c decoders (or general: clients) are being
      used by several adapters (main drivers), and in some cases, one adapter
      simply needs different settings than the other, either because the adapter
      is completely different or because the card was reverse engineered in a way
      that doesn't allow multiple adapters to run using the same original
      initialization data.  Michael faces such a problem right now.  Both he and
      me lack time to properly sit together and work out the exact details or a
      proper way to merge.
    
    * VBI_BYPASS and GPIO set specific pins on the decoder.  This will be used
      in the saa7111 driver.  My driver (zr36067, original user of the saa7111
      driver) doesn't use any of this, but Michael's does.

    Following a suggestion of Arthur Othieno, here is a trivial patch that

    it doesn't seem to be necessary but Eugene doesn't seem to think it's a
    good idea. So I may give it a try later (in 2.7), but for now this
    simple patch will be enough.

    This is a fairly minimal fix for aacraid. It removes the happy cast

    2.4 equivalents. I've not backported any of the other changes from 2.4 to
    2.6 yet, and some things have gone which are good to be gone (eg the
    proc/scsi horror). There is a certain amount of white space noise caused
    by realigning with the 2.4 code so I could see what was going on.

    [sound/oss] remove bogus CIV_TO_LVI
    
    This patch removes a pair of bogus LVI assignments.  The explanation in
    the comment is wrong because the value of PCIB tells the hardware that
    the DMA buffer can be processed even if LVI == CIV.
    
    Setting LVI to CIV + 1 causes overruns when with short writes
    (something that vmware is very fond of).

    [PATCH] 8139too not running s3 suspend/resume pci fix
    
    From: "Adrian Yee" <brewt-linux-kernel@brewt.org>
    
    Having an 8139 based device in my notebook, I often switch between it and
    wireless.  The problem is that the 8139too driver does not save/restore the
    pci configuration of the card if the device isn't running.  This simple
    patch moves the save/restore code so that the code runs regardless of
    whether or not the device is running.
    
    I looked at other drivers and they all seem to do the same thing.  Is there
    a reason why this isn't done like in the patch?

    [PATCH] lance.c: fix for card with signature 0x52 0x49
    
    From: Vesselin Kostadiov <vesselin@alphawave.com.au>
    
    Problem: The lance.c driver did not work with my Racal Interlan EtherBlaster
    card.
    
    More info: I found that my card has a signature 0x52 0x49 that was not
    recognized by the driver.
    
    Explanation: Following your suggestion I created a static table with possible
    signatures, not too different from the table in ni65.c.  The updated code
    compares the first byte of the cards signature with the first byte of the
    signatures from the table.  It this succeeds then it reads the second byte and
    compares the whole signature with the values from the table.  This way the
    minimal I/O reads approach is maintained.
    
    Side effect: The previous version would missdetect cards with signatures 0x52
    0x57 and 0x57 0x44.  This has been fixed as well.

    [PATCH] ppc64: extra barrier in I/O operations
    
    At the moment, on PPC64, the instruction we use for wmb() doesn't
    order cacheable stores vs. non-cacheable stores.  (It does order
    cacheable vs. cacheable and non-cacheable vs. non-cacheable.)  This
    causes problems in the sort of driver code that writes stuff into
    memory, does a wmb(), then a writel to the device to start a DMA
    operation to read the stuff it has just written to memory.
    
    This patch solves the problem by adding a sync instruction before the
    store in the write* and out* macros.  The sync is a full barrier that
    orders all loads and stores, cacheable or not.  The patch also moves
    the eieio instruction that we had after the store to before the load
    in the read* and in* macros.  With the sync before the store, we don't
    need an eieio as well in a sequence of stores, but we still need an
    eieio between a store and a load.
    
    I think it is better to do this than to turn wmb() into a full memory
    barrier (a sync instruction) because the full barrier is slow and
    isn't needed with the sync in the write*/out* macros.  This way,
    write*/out* are fully ordered with respect to preceding loads and
    stores, which is what driver writers expect, and we avoid penalizing
    users of wmb() who are only doing cacheable stores.

    (re)setting ->s_op we have the MFT_FILE inode set up by explicit new_inode()/
    set ->i_ino/insert_inode_hash()/call ntfs_read_inode_mount() directly.
    That kills the need of second super_operations and it allows to return
    error from ntfs_read_inode_mount() without resorting to ugly "poisoning"
    tricks.

    qla2100 fabric fixes
    
    From: "Andrew Vasquez" <andrew.vasquez@qlogic.com>
    
    Ok, well there aren't too many folks using an QLA2100 in a fabric
    topology, if there were, they wouldn't have gotten very far in the
    driver load sequence.  I've been able to scrape-up a QLA2100, 1Gig
    switch, and an JBOD.  Upon loading the 8.00.00b12k driver, the
    firmware successfully logs into the switch, the driver receives a
    LOOP_UP event, but, the kernel panics due to NULL pointer dereference
    while trying to perform an RFT_ID  -- the attached patch against
    current scsi-misc-2.6 fixes that problem.

    [PATCH] fix LLD module refcounting in sr.c
    
    The patch to close all the open/close/hotplug races in sr left the
    module refcounting broken so that the ULD housing the CD device now
    can't be removed until the device itself is removed.
    
    This patch (structurally identical to the one for sd.c to perform the
    same function) fixes the module refcounting.

    From: Andi Kleen <ak@muc.de>
    
    Set up SMT for the domain scheduler on x86-64.  This way the scheduling
    works better on HyperThreading aware systems; in particular it will use
    both physical CPUs before sharing two virtual CPUs on the same package.
    This improves performance considerably in some cases.
    
    Based on the i386 code and a previous patch from Suresh B. Siddha.

    [PATCH] Fix __down Tainting Kernel with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    PowerPC64 ABI has ".funcname" (the actual function) and "funcname" (the
    function descriptor) and we strip off the dots in "dedotify" called from
    module_frob_arch_sections().  We need to also de-dotify the corresponding
    names in the __version section.
    
    Actually has nothing to do with __down, it's just that we only print the
    first symbol whose version is missing.

    [PATCH] PPC termio fix
    
    From: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>
    
    It turns out that we are not handling the TABDLY bits of the termios
    c_oflag field correctly on PPC, PPC64 and Alpha.  These three architectures
    have a value for XTABS that is different from the TAB3 value.  POSIX
    specifies that setting the TABDLY field to TAB3 should result in tabs being
    expanded to spaces.  In n_tty.c:opost() we check for O_TABDLY(tty) ==
    XTABS, which is fine on most architectures because they have XTABS == TAB3.
    
    I think the right thing to do is just to change the definition of XTABS to
    be the same as TAB3 on these architectures.  The patch below does this for
    PPC and PPC64 (and I suggest the Alpha maintainer should do the same).  At
    the moment, applications using either the XTABS or TAB3 values won't get
    the expected behaviour.  With this patch, apps that use TAB3 will get the
    expected behaviour.  Apps that use XTABS will need to be recompiled (but
    note that the POSIX-specified name to use is TAB3 not XTABS).

    [PATCH] remove intermezzo
    
    Peter Braam said:
    
        I would just like to say that I have no difficulties with intermezzo
        being rm -rf'd.  There are probably only a handful of users.
    
        In the past 4 years nobody has supported InterMezzo sufficiently for
        it to become successful.  I have been fortunate to get really good support
        for the Lustre project.  So I have focussed on that.  Lustre 1.X has
        become really solid.
    
        The disconnected operation, caching and mirroring functionality of
        InterMezzo will become available in Lustre as a new feature in version 2.
    
         So I see no point in keeping InterMezzo if it is a nuisance.
    
    
    The patch removes the references to intermezzo.  Please do a `bk rm' of
    fs/intermezzo.

    [PATCH] Add sysctl to define a hugetlb-capable group
    
    From: "Chen, Kenneth W" <kenneth.w.chen@intel.com>,
          "Seth, Rohit" <rohit.seth@intel.com>
    
    This patch addresses the longstanding problem wherein Oracle needs
    CAP_IPC_LOCK to allocate SHM_HUGETLB shm memory, but people don't want to run
    Oracle as root, and capabilties are busted.
    
    Various ideas with rlimits didn't work out, mainly because these objects live
    beyond the lifetime of the user processes which establish them.
    
    What we do is to create root-writeable /proc/sys/vm/hugetlb_shm_group which
    specifies a single group ID.  Users who belong to that group may allocate
    hugepages for SHM_HUGETLB shm segments.
    
    So the sysadmin will greate a new group, say `hugepageusers', will add the
    oracle user to that group and will write that group's ID into
    /proc/sys/vm/hugetlb_shm_group.

    [PATCH] hugepage: fix add_to_page_cache() error handling
    
    From: David Gibson <david@gibson.dropbear.id.au>
    
    add_to_page_cache() locks the given page if and only if it suceeds.  The
    hugepage code (every arch), however, does an unlock_page() after
    add_to_page_cache() before checking the return code, which could trip the
    BUG() in unlock_page() if add_to_page_cache() failed.
    
    In practice we've never hit this bug, because the only ways
    add_to_page_cache() can fail are when we fail to allocate a radix tree node
    (very rare), or when there is already a page at that offset in the radix
    tree, which never happens during prefault, obviously.  We should probably
    fix it anyway, though.
    
    The analagous bug in some of the patches floating about to
    demand-allocation of hugepages is more of a problem, because multiple
    processes can race to instantiate a particular page in the radix tree -
    that's been hit at least once (which is how I found this).

     Maybe change to:
     err("%s: Failed to disable slot, error code(%d)\n", __FUNCTION__,
     retval);
    
    I think it is right because at line 1564, the slot is turned off, and in
    this line (1575) is checked the status to see if we got an error; if so,
    the error number is shown.  This number is in 'retval', not in 'rc' ('rc'
    does have the return of configure_new_device()).

    [PATCH] as-iosched barrier fix
    
    From: Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>
    
    AS does not correctly account requests inserted with INSERT_FRONT or
    INSERT_BACK, barriers for example.  In other elevators, requeued requests also
    go through the insert path, but AS has its own requeue handler which means the
    code has never been tested.
    
    Also, make inserting a barrier with INSERT_SORT imply INSERT_BACK, which is
    the logical behaviour.  Previously such insertions weren't rigorously defined.

    Currently, if a user creates an mqueue and passes an mq_attr, the
    info->messages will be created twice (and the extra one is properly freed).
    This patch simply delays the allocation so that it only ever happens once.
    The relevant mq_attr data is passed to lower levels via the dentry->d_fsdata
    fs private data.  This also helps isolate the areas we'd need to touch to do
    rlimits on mqueues.

    [PATCH] bfs filesystem read past the end of dir
    
    From: Jakub Jermar <jermar@itbs.cz>
    
    I found out that BFS filesystem will eventually try to read and interpret
    garbage past the end of directory in bfs_add_entry().  If the garbage
    (interpreted as i-node number) is not set to zero (does it have to be?)
    bfs_add_entry() will consider it a regular directory entry.
    
    This causes weird things like this:
    # touch a
    # rm a
    # ls
    # touch b
    # ls
    a
    
    My patch detects an attempt to read past the end of directory and explicitly
    clears the garbage that represents i-node number.  Thus the correct behaviour
    is achieved.

    [PATCH] es7000 subarch update for generic arch
    
    From: "Protasevich, Natalie" <Natalie.Protasevich@UNISYS.com>
    
    This is ES7000 sub architecture update.  It makes ES7000 a part of the
    generic architecture, so the single compiled kernel will be able to choose
    a correct set of parameters, routines ("genapic"), and a boot path.  It
    uses criteria provided by the subarch for platform identification.  In case
    of ES7000, it is a unique product/vendor string in the ACPI/MP OEM table,
    and server control registers.  The patch is confined to only es7000 subarch
    and generic subarch.  It was tested on ES7000 as well as generic Intel 8x
    Xeon system.  Andi Kleen has reviewed the changes.

    [PATCH] CLOCK_TICK_RATE: introduce asm-*/8253pit.h, #define PIT_TICK_RATE constant.
    
    From: Thorsten Kranzkowski <dl8bcu@dl8bcu.de>
    
    The calculation of the counter values in drivers/input/misc/pcspkr.c is
    incorrectly based on CLOCK_TICK_RATE.  This goes unnoticed in i386 because
    there the system clock is driven by the same Programmable Interval Timer chip
    as the speaker.  But this doesn't hold true on other archs, e.g.  Alpha.
    
    To solve this problem I made these patches:
    
    1/3:    introduce asm-*/8253pit.h, #define PIT_TICK_RATE constant.
            It seems this is not always the same value.
    2/3:    use PIT_TICK_RATE in *spkr.c
    3/3:    use CLOCK_TICK_RATE where 1193180 was used in general timing
            calculations. (optional)
    
    There are still some places where the magic number is used instead of the
    #define (vt_ioctl.c, gameport.c) but I left them as-is.  I got some responses
    from arch maintainers to specifically not touch their respective architectures
    so changing these places would mean breakage for them.
    
    Tested on Alpha and i386, ack'ed by Ralf Baechle for MIPS.
    
    
    This patch:
    
    introduce asm-*/8253pit.h, #define PIT_TICK_RATE constant.

    [PATCH] readahead: keep file->f_ra sane
    
    When two threads are simultaneously pread()ing from the same fd (which is a
    legitimate thing to do), the readahead code thinks that a huge amount of
    seeking is happening and shrinks the window, damaging performance a lot.
    
    I don't see a sane way to avoid this within the readahead code, so take a
    private copy of the readahead state and restore it prior to returning from the
    read.

    From: john stultz <johnstul@us.ibm.com>
    
    This patch polishes up Tim Schmielau's (tim@physik3.uni-rostock.de) fix for
    jiffies_to_clock_t() and jiffies_64_to_clock_t().  The issues observed was
    w/ /proc output not matching up to wall time due to accumulated error
    caused by HZ not being exactly 1000 on i386 systems.  The solution is to
    correct that error by using the more accurate TICK_NSEC in our calculation.
    
    Additionally, this patch corrects 3 warnings in the TCP layer uncovered by
    this change.

    The warning is correct, the calculated value for ramdisk_max would be
    0xb7ffffff instead of 0x37ffffff.  Truncating 0xb7ffffff to 0x37ffffff
    is desired behaviour, so we should do it explicitly.

    [PATCH] Warn when smp_call_function() is called with interrupts disabled
    
    From: Keith Owens <kaos@sgi.com>
    
    Almost every architecture has a comment above smp_call_function()
    
     * You must not call this function with disabled interrupts or from a
     * hardware interrupt handler or from a bottom half handler.
    
    I have not seen any problems with calling smp_call_function() from a bottom
    half handler, but calling it with interrupts disabled can definitely
    deadlock.  This bug is hard to reproduce and even harder to debug.
    
    CPU A                               CPU B
    Disable interrupts
                                        smp_call_function()
                                        Take call_lock
                                        Send IPIs
                                        Wait for all cpus to acknowledge IPI
                                        CPU A has not responded, spin waiting
                                        for cpu A to respond, holding call_lock
    smp_call_function()
    Spin waiting for call_lock
    Deadlock                            Deadlock
    
    Change all smp_call_function() to WARN_ON(irqs_disabled()).  It should be
    BUG_ON() but some buggy code like SCSI sg will break with BUG_ON, so just
    warn for now.  Change it to BUG_ON after the buggy code has been fixed.

    There's a deadlock in __create_workqueue when CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU is set.  This
    can happen when create_workqueue_thread fails to create a worker thread.  In
    that case, we call destroy_workqueue with cpu hotplug lock held.
    destroy_workqueue however also attempts to take the same lock.

    [PATCH] dentry and inode cache hash algorithm performance changes.
    
    From: "Jose R. Santos" <jrsantos@austin.ibm.com>
    
    It alleviates some issues seen with Linux when accessing millions of files on
    machines with large amounts of RAM (+32GB).  Both algorithms are base on some
    studies that Dominique Heger was doing on hash table efficiencies in Linux.
    The dentry hash table has been tested in small systems with one internal IDE
    hard disk as well as in large SMP with many fiberchanel disks.  Dominique
    claims that in all the testing done, they did not see one case were this has
    function provided worst performance and that in most test they were seeing
    better performance.
    
    The inode hash function was done by me base on Dominique's original work and
    has only been stress tested with SpecSFS.  It provided a 3% improvement over
    the default algorithm in the SpecSFS results and speed ups in the response
    time of almost all filesystem operations the benchmark stress.  With the
    better distribution is as also possible to reduce the number of inode buckets
    for 32 million to 16 million and still get a slightly better results.
    
    Anton was nice enough to provide some graphs that show the distribution
    before and after the patch at http://samba.org/~anton/linux/sfs/1/
    
    For the dentry hash function, some of my other coorkers had put this hash
    function through various testing and have concluded that the hash function was
    equal or better than the default hash function.  These runs were done with a
    (hopefully to be Open Source soon) benchmark called FFSB which can simulate
    various io patters across many filesystems and variable file sizes.
    
    SpecSFS fileset is basically a lot of small file which varies depending on the
    size of the run.  For a not so big SMP system the number of file is in the +20
    Million files range.  Of those 20 million files only 10% are access randomly
    by the client.  The purpose of this is that the benchmark tries to stress not
    only the NFS layer but, VM and Filesystems layers as well.  The filesets are
    also hundreds of gigabytes in size in order to promote disk head movement by
    guaranteeing cache misses in memory.  SFS 27% of the workload are lookups
    __d_lookup has showing high in my profiles.
    
    For the inode hash the problem that I see is that when running a benchmark
    with this huge fileset we end up trying to free a lot of inode entries during
    the run while trying to put new entries in cache.  We end up calling
    ifind_fast() which calls find_inodes_fast() held under inode_lock.  In order
    to avoid holding the inode_lock we needed to avoid having long chains in that
    hash function.
    
    When I took a look at the original hash function, I found it to be a bit to
    simple for any workload.  My solution (which I took advantage of Dominique's
    work) was to create a hash that function that could generate completely
    different hashes depending on the hashval and the superblock in order to have
    the hash scale as we added more filesystems to the machine.
    
    Both of these problems can be somewhat tuned out by increasing the number of
    buckets of both d and i cache but it got to a point were I had 256MB of inode
    and 128MB in dentry hash buckets on a not so large SMP.  With the hash changes
    I have been able to reduce the number of buckets to 128MB for inode cache and
    to 32MB for dentry cache and still get better performance.
    
    If it help my case...  I haven't been running this benchmark for long, so I
    haven't been able to find a way to cheat.  I need to come up with generic
    solutions until I can find a cheat for the benchmark.  :)
    
    
    SDET results:
    
    Steve Pratt seem to have a SDET setup already and he did me the favor of
    running SDET with a reduce dentry entry hash table size.  I belive that
    his table suggest that less than 3% change is acceptable variability, but
    overall he got a 5% better number using the new hash algorith.

    From: Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
    
    Clean up the edd.c driver.
    
    * use kobject_set_name() instead of snprintf() per GregKH's recommendation.
    * Add MODULE_VERSION()
    * s/driverfs/sysfs/ in Kconfig
    * Remove report URL message, as there have been too many BIOSs reported,
      virtually none of which are EDD-capable.  This may return if/when I
      develop a better reporting method and database to capture/store the
      data from users.
    * Remove the unused code for creating a symlink to the scsi_device.
      This never worked right, and I'm going to show the relationship from
      a userspace tool which uses libsysfs instead.

    [PATCH] Un-inline spinlocks on ppc64
    
    From: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>
    
    The patch below moves the ppc64 spinlocks and rwlocks out of line and into
    arch/ppc64/lib/locks.c, and implements _raw_spin_lock_flags for ppc64.
    
    Part of the motivation for moving the spinlocks and rwlocks out of line was
    that I needed to add code to the slow paths to yield the processor to the
    hypervisor on systems with shared processors.  On these systems, a cpu as
    seen by the kernel is a virtual processor that is not necessarily running
    full-time on a real physical cpu.  If we are spinning on a lock which is
    held by another virtual processor which is not running at the moment, we
    are just wasting time.  In such a situation it is better to do a hypervisor
    call to ask it to give the rest of our time slice to the lock holder so
    that forward progress can be made.
    
    The one problem with out-of-line spinlock routines is that lock contention
    will show up in profiles in the spin_lock etc.  routines rather than in the
    callers, as it does with inline spinlocks.  I have added a CONFIG_SPINLINE
    config option for people that want to do profiling.  In the longer term, Anton
    is talking about teaching the profiling code to attribute samples in the spin
    lock routines to the routine's caller.
    
    This patch reduces the kernel by about 80kB on my G5.  With inline
    spinlocks selected, the kernel gets about 4kB bigger than without the
    patch, because _raw_spin_lock_flags is slightly bigger than _raw_spin_lock.
    
    This patch depends on the patch from Keith Owens to add
    _raw_spin_lock_flags.

    [PATCH] Allow architectures to reenable interrupts on contended spinlocks
    
    From: Keith Owens <kaos@sgi.com>
    
    As requested by Linus, update all architectures to add the common
    infrastructure.  Tested on ia64 and i386.
    
    Enable interrupts while waiting for a disabled spinlock, but only if
    interrupts were enabled before issuing spin_lock_irqsave().
    
    This patch consists of three sections :-
    
    * An architecture independent change to call _raw_spin_lock_flags()
      instead of _raw_spin_lock() when the flags are available.
    
    * An ia64 specific change to implement _raw_spin_lock_flags() and to
      define _raw_spin_lock(lock) as _raw_spin_lock_flags(lock, 0) for the
      ASM_SUPPORTED case.
    
    * Patches for all other architectures and for ia64 with !ASM_SUPPORTED
      to map _raw_spin_lock_flags(lock, flags) to _raw_spin_lock(lock).
      Architecture maintainers can define _raw_spin_lock_flags() to do
      something useful if they want to enable interrupts while waiting for
      a disabled spinlock.

    [PATCH] Improve laptop mode's block_dump output
    
    From: "Theodore Ts'o" <tytso@mit.edu>
    
    This patch versus improves the output produced by "echo 1 >
    /proc/sys/vm/block_dump", in the following ways:
    
    1) The messages are printed with KERN_DEBUG, so that even if sysklogd is
       running, if configured appropriately, it will not need to write to log
       files.
    
    2) The inode which is dirtied by a process is now identified more
       precisely by inode number and filesystem ID, and by a dcache name if
       present.
    
    3) In the generic filesystem sget function, the superblock id (s_id) is
       filled in with the filesystem type by default.  Filesystems which are
       block-device based will override s_id, but this allows pseudo
       filesystems such as tmpfs, procfs, etc.  to be identified in (2).

    [PATCH] shrink_slab: improved handling of GFP_NOFS allocations
    
    Currently, shrink_slab() will decide that it needs to scan a certain number of
    dentries, will call shrink_dcache_memory() requesting that this be done, and
    shrink_dcache_memory() will simply bale out without doing anything because the
    caller did not have __GFP_FS.
    
    This has the potential to disrupt our lovely pagecache-vs-slab balancing act.
    So change things so that shrinker callouts can return -1, indicating that they
    baled out.  This way, shrink_slab can remember that this slab was owed a
    certain number of scannings and these will be correctly performed next time a
    __GFP_FS caller comes by.

    [PATCH] New version of early CPU detect
    
    From: Andi Kleen <ak@suse.de>
    
    We still need some kind of early CPU detection, e.g.  for the AMD768
    workaround and for the slab allocator to size its slabs correctly for the
    cache line.  Also some other code already had private early CPU routines.
    
    This patch takes a new approach compared to the previous patch which caused
    Andrew so much grief.  It only fills in a few selected fields in
    boot_cpu_data (only the data needed to identify the CPU type and the cache
    alignment).  In particular the feature masks are not filled in, and the
    other fields are also not touched to prevent unwanted side effects.
    
    Also convert the ppro workaround to use standard cpu data now.
    
    I'm not sure if slab still has the necessary support to use the cache line
    size early; previously Manfred showed some serious memory saving with this
    for kernels that are compiled for a bigger cache line size than the CPU (is
    often the case on distribution kernels).  This code could be reenable now
    with this patch.

    [PATCH] es7000 subarch update
    
    From: "Protasevich, Natalie" <Natalie.Protasevich@UNISYS.com>
    
    The patch fixes a problem with ES7000 Server Management mechanism that uses
    platform register mip_port.  It was not initialized, so the mechanism was not
    functional.
    
    The patch also fixes the APIC destination for hierarchical and flat cluster
    models used in ES7000.  The destination ID's reflect policies for Cascade
    based systems which use logical delivery and lowest priority mechanism, and
    for xAPIC based models that use physical delivery and fixed APIC destinations.
    
    The patch also turns on NO_IOAPIC_CHECK (1) to avoid error messages and
    attempts to re-write the ID, because on ES7000 all ID's are hard coded in the
    BIOS and cannot be altered.

    From: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>
    
    sys32_nfsservctl is the largest remaining syscall emulation handler that can

    simpler implementation than the one used by s390, sparc ppc and that the new
    compat_sys_nfsservctl is based on.
    
    The user access checks in the code are inconsistant at least, which should be
    fixed here.
    
    Compile tested only due to lack of proper test setup.

    [PATCH] selinux: reopen descriptors closed on exec to /dev/null
    
    From: Stephen Smalley <sds@epoch.ncsc.mil>
    
    This patch changes the SELinux module to try to reset any descriptors it
    closes on exec (due to a lack of permission by the new domain to the inherited
    open file) to refer to the null device.  This counters the problem of SELinux
    inducing program misbehavior, particularly due to having descriptors 0-2
    closed when the new domain is not allowed access to the caller's tty.  This is
    primarily to address the case where the caller is trusted with respect to the
    new domain, as the untrusted caller case is already handled via AT_SECURE and
    glibc secure mode.  The code is partly based on the OpenWall LSM, which in
    turn drew from the OpenWall kernel patch.  Note that the code does not
    guarantee that the descriptor is always re-opened to /dev/null; it merely
    makes a reasonable effort to do so, but can fail under various conditions.

    [PATCH] ext3 error handling fixes
    
    From: Andreas Dilger <adilger@clusterfs.com>
    
    a) we don't call ext3_error() for an IO error in ext3_find_entry(), so we
       won't do the normal ext3 error handling (mark SB in error, remount-ro
       or panic if desired);
    b) in empty_dir() we don't continue checking for non-empty blocks after a
       content error (ext3_check_dir_entry() calls ext3_error() already);
    c) we had decided not to mark the SB in error for holes in directories to
       allow leway in the indexed-directory implementation, but this change
       incorrectly also disabled marking the SB in error for real IO errors.

    [PATCH] sched: in_sched_functions() cleanup
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    1) Create an in_sched_functions() function in sched.c and make the
       archs use it.  (Two archs have wchan #if 0'd out: left them alone).
    
    2) Move __sched from linux/init.h to linux/sched.h and add comment.
    
    3) Rename __scheduling_functions_start_here/end_here to __sched_text_start/end.

    [PATCH] Fix ext3 bogus ENOSPC
    
    With strange workloads which do a lot of quick truncation on small filesystems
    it is possible to get into a situation where there are free blocks on the
    disk, but they are not allocatable at this time due to their having been freed
    up in the current JBD transaction.  Applications get unexpected ENOSPC errors.
    
    We can fix that with this patch, originally by Andreas Dilger which forces a
    single commit+retry when an ENOSPC is encountered.

    [PATCH] reduce NMI watchdog call frequency with local APIC.
    
    From: Mikael Pettersson <mikpe@csd.uu.se>
    
    The real problem is that SMP with nmi_watchdog=2 initialises the lapic NMI
    watchdog but doesn't check it and therefore doesn't reduce nmi_hz.  This is
    an SMP bug.
    
    The patch changes smpboot.c to do a check_nmi_watchdog() at the appropriate
    place, which fixes the high NMI frequency problem w/o changing anything
    else.  I've verified that it solves the problem on my MP-capable UP box.

    From: Philippe Elie <phil.el@wanadoo.fr>
    
    With nmi_watchdog=2 and a P4 ht box the nmi is occurring only on logical
    processor 0, it's better to get it on both.
    
    With this patch, on x86 SMP and nmi_watchdog=2, nmi interupts occur at 1000
    hz (if the cpu is loaded) not at the intended 1 hz rate but that's a distinct
    problem.

    [PATCH] Fixes in 32 bit ioctl emulation code
    
    From: Raghavan <raghav@in.ibm.com>,
          me
    
    I am submitting a patch that fixes 2 race conditions in the 32 bit ioctl
    emulation code.(fs/compat.c) Since the search is not locked; when a
    ioctl_trans structure is deleted, corruption can occur.
    
    The following scenarios discuss the race conditions:
    
    1) When the search is hapenning, if any ioctl_trans structure gets
       deleted; then rather than searching the hash table, the code will start
       searching the free list.

    P.S 	- I assumed that having the task state set to TASK_INTERRUTIBLE
    	  while it is doing active_load_balance is fine. It seemed to be
    	  the case earlier also.

    [PATCH] Move migrate_all_tasks to CPU_DEAD handling
    
    From: Srivatsa Vaddagiri <vatsa@in.ibm.com>
    
    migrate_all_tasks is currently run with rest of the machine stopped.
    It iterates thr' the complete task table, turning off cpu affinity of any task
    that it finds affine to the dying cpu. Depending on the task table
    size this can take considerable time. All this time machine is stopped, doing
    nothing.
    
    Stopping the machine for such extended periods can be avoided if we do
    task migration in CPU_DEAD notification and that's precisely what this patch
    does.
    
    The patch puts idle task to the _front_ of the dying CPU's runqueue at the
    highest priority possible. This cause idle thread to run _immediately_ after
    kstopmachine thread yields. Idle thread notices that its cpu is offline and
    dies quickly. Task migration can then be done at leisure in CPU_DEAD
    notification, when rest of the CPUs are running.
    
    Some advantages with this approach are:
    
    	- More scalable. Predicatable amout of time that machine is stopped.
    	- No changes to hot path/core code. We are just exploiting scheduler
    	  rules which runs the next high-priority task on the runqueue. Also
    	  since I put idle task to the _front_ of the runqueue, there
    	  are no races when a equally high priority task is woken up
    	  and added to the runqueue. It gets in at the back of the runqueue,
    	  _after_ idle task!
    	- cpu_is_offline check that is presenty required in try_to_wake_up,
    	  idle_balance and rebalance_tick can be removed, thus speeding them
    	  up a bit
    
    From: Srivatsa Vaddagiri <vatsa@in.ibm.com>
    
      Rusty mentioned that the unlikely hints against cpu_is_offline is
      redundant since the macro already has that hint.  Patch below removes those
      redundant hints I added.

    [PATCH] sched: Look at another CPU's domain
    
    From: Nick Piggin <nickpiggin@yahoo.com.au>
    
    The SMT wake_idle code really wants to look at a non-local CPU's domain in
    order to check for idle siblings.
    
    So change the domain attachment code a little bit so we continue to hold a
    runqueue's lock while attaching a new domain.  This means the locking rules
    have changed to: you may access your own domain without any lock, you must
    hold a remote runqueue's lock in order to view its domain.

    [PATCH] sched: reduce idle time
    
    From: Nick Piggin <nickpiggin@yahoo.com.au>
    
    It makes NEWLY_IDLE balances cause find_busiest_group return the busiest
    available group even if there isn't an imbalance.  Basically - try a bit
    harder to prevent schedule emptying the runqueue.
    
    It is quite aggressive, but that isn't so bad because we don't (by default)
    do NEWLY_IDLE balancing across NUMA nodes, and NEWLY_IDLE balancing is always
    restricted to cache_hot tasks.
    
    It picked up a little bit of idle time that dbt2-pgsql was seeing...

    [PATCH] sched: balance-on-clone
    
    From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
    
    Implement balancing during clone().  It does the following things:
    
    - introduces SD_BALANCE_CLONE that can serve as a tool for an
      architecture to limit the search-idlest-CPU scope on clone().
      E.g. the 512-CPU systems should rather not enable this.
    
    - uses the highest sd for the imbalance_pct, not this_rq (which didnt
      make sense).
    
    - unifies balance-on-exec and balance-on-clone via the find_idlest_cpu()
      function. Gets rid of sched_best_cpu() which was still a bit
      inconsistent IMO, it used 'min_load < load' as a condition for
      balancing - while a more correct approach would be to use half of the
      imbalance_pct, like passive balancing does.
    
    - the patch also reintroduces the possibility to do SD_BALANCE_EXEC on
      SMP systems, and activates it - to get testing.
    
    - NOTE: there's one thing in this patch that is slightly unclean: i
      introduced wake_up_forked_thread. I did this to make it easier to get
      rid of this patch later (wake_up_forked_process() has lots of
      dependencies in various architectures). If this capability remains in
      the kernel then i'll clean it up and introduce one function for
      wake_up_forked_process/thread.
    
    - NOTE2: i added the SD_BALANCE_CLONE flag to the NUMA CPU template too.
      Some NUMA architectures probably want to disable this.

    [PATCH] sched: passive balancing damping
    
    From: Nick Piggin <nickpiggin@yahoo.com.au>
    
    This patch starts to balance woken processes when half the relevant domain's
    imbalance_pct is reached.  Previously balancing would start after a small,
    constant difference in waker/wakee runqueue loads was reached, which would
    cause too much process movement when there are lots of processes running.
    
    It also turns wake balancing into a domain flag while previously it was always
    on.  Now sched domains can "soft partition" an SMP system without using
    processor affinities.

    [PATCH] sched: extend sync wakeups
    
    From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
    
    The attached patch extends sync wakeups to the process sys_exit() path too:
    the chldwait wakeup can be done sync, since we know that the process is
    going to exit (and thus deschedule).
    
    The most visible effect of this change is strace's behavior on SMP systems:
    it now stays on a single CPU, together with the traced child.  (previously
    it would run in parallel to the child, bouncing around madly.)

    De-racify the sched domain setup code.  This involves creating a dummy
    "init" domain during sched_init (which is called early).
    
    When topology information becomes available, the sched domains are then
    built and attached.  The attach mechanism is asynchronous and uses the
    migration threads, which perform the switch with interrupts off.  This is a
    quiescent state, so domains can still be lockless on the read side.  It
    also allows us to change the domains at runtime without much more work.
    This is something SGI is interested in to elegantly do soft partitioning of
    their systems without having to use hard cpu affinities (which cause
    balancing problems of their own).
    
    The current setup code also has a race somewhere because it is unable to
    boot on a 384 CPU system.
    
    
    
    From: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>
    
       This is basically a mindless ppc64 merge of the x86 changes to sched
       domain init code.
    
       Actually if I produce a sibling_map[] then the x86 code and the ppc64
       will be identical.  Maybe we can merge it.

    [PATCH] ppc64: sched-domain support
    
    From: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>
    
    Below are the diffs between the current ppc64 sched init stuff and x86.
    
    - Ignore the POWER5 specific stuff, I dont set up a sibling map yet.
    - What should I set cache_hot_time to?
    
    large cpumask typechecking requirements (perhaps useful on x86 as well):
    - cpu->cpumask = CPU_MASK_NONE -> cpus_clear(cpu->cpumask);
    - cpus_and(nodemask, node_to_cpumask(i), cpu_possible_map) doesnt work,
      need to use a temporary

    [PATCH] Hotplug CPU sched_balance_exec Fix
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    From: Srivatsa Vaddagiri <vatsa@in.ibm.com>
    From: Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org>
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    We want to get rid of lock_cpu_hotplug() in sched_migrate_task.  Found
    that lockless migration of execing task is _extremely_ racy.  The
    races I hit are described below, alongwith probable solutions.
    
    Task migration done elsewhere should be safe (?) since they either
    hold the lock (sys_sched_setaffinity) or are done entirely with preemption
    disabled (load_balance).
    
       sched_balance_exec does:
    
    	a. disables preemption
    	b. finds new_cpu for current
    	c. enables preemption
    	d. calls sched_migrate_task to migrate current to new_cpu
    
       and sched_migrate_task does:
    
    	e. task_rq_lock(p)
    	f. migrate_task(p, dest_cpu ..)
    		(if we have to wait for migration thread)
    		g. task_rq_unlock()
    		h. wake_up_process(rq->migration_thread)
    		i. wait_for_completion()
    
       Several things can happen here:
    
    	1. new_cpu can go down after h and before migration thread has
    	   got around to handle the request
    
    	   ==> we need to add a cpu_is_offline check in __migrate_task
    
    	2. new_cpu can go down between c and d or before f.
    
    	   ===> Even though this case is automatically handled by the above
    	        change (migrate_task being called on a running task, current,
    		will delegate migration to migration thread), would it be
    	 	good practice to avoid calling migrate_task in the first place
    		itself when dest_cpu is offline. This means adding another
    	 	cpu_is_offline check after e in sched_migrate_task
    
    	3. The 'current' task can get preempted _immediately_ after
    	   g and when it comes back, task_cpu(p) can be dead. In
    	   which case, it is invalid to do wake_up on a non-existent migration
    	   thread.  (rq->migration_thread can be NULL).
    
    	   ===> We should disable preemption thr' g and h
    
    	4. Before migration thread gets around to handle the request, its cpu
    	   goes dead. This will leave unhandled migration requests in the dead
    	   cpu.
    
    	   ===> We need to wakeup sleeping requestors (if any) in CPU_DEAD
    	        notification.
    
    I really wonder if we can get rid of these issues by avoiding balancing at
    exec time and instead have it balanced during load_balance ..Alternately
    if this is valuable and we want to retain it, I think we still need to
    consider a read/write sem, with sched_migrate_task doing down_read_trylock.
    This may eliminate the deadlock I hit between cpu_up and CPU_UP_PREPARE
    notification, which had forced me away from r/w sem.
    
    Anyway patch below addresses the above races. Its against 2.6.6-rc2-mm1
    and has been tested on a 4way Intel Pentium SMP m/c.
    
    
    Rusty sez:
    
    Two other changes:
    1) I grabbed a reference to the thread, rather than using
    preempt_disable().  It's the more obvious way I think.
    
    2) Why the wait_to_die code?  It might be needed if we move tasks after
    stop_machine, but for nowI don't see the problem with the migration
    thread running on the wrong CPU for a bit: nothing is on this runqueue
    so active_load_balance is safe, and __migrate task will be a noop (due
    to cpu_is_offline() check).  If there is a problem, your fix is racy,
    because we could be preempted immediately afterwards.
    
    So I just stop the kthread then wakeup any remaining...

    [PATCH] Reduce TLB flushing during process migration
    
    From: Martin Hicks <mort@wildopensource.com>
    
    Another optimization patch from Jack Steiner, intended to reduce TLB
    flushes during process migration.
    
    Most architextures should define tlb_migrate_prepare() to be flush_tlb_mm(),
    but on i386, it would be a wasted flush, because i386 disconnects previous
    cpus from the tlb flush automatically.

    [PATCH] sched: add local load metrics
    
    From: Nick Piggin <piggin@cyberone.com.au>
    
    This patch removes the per runqueue array of NR_CPU arrays.  Each time we
    want to check a remote CPU's load we check nr_running as well anyway, so
    introduce a cpu_load which is the load of the local runqueue and is kept
    updated in the timer tick.  Put them in the same cacheline.
    
    This has additional benefits of having the cpu_load consistent across all
    CPUs and more up to date.  It is sampled better too, being updated once per
    timer tick.
    
    This shouldn't make much difference in scheduling behaviour, but all
    benchmarks are either as good or better on the 16-way NUMAQ: hackbench,
    reaim, volanomark are about the same, tbench and dbench are maybe a bit
    better.  kernbench is about one percent better.
    
    John reckons it isn't a big deal, but it does save 4K per CPU or 2MB total
    on his big systems, so I figure it must be a bit kinder on the caches.  I
    think it is just nicer in general anyway.

    [PATCH] sched: SMT niceness handling
    
    From: Con Kolivas <kernel@kolivas.org>
    
    This patch provides full per-package priority support for SMT processors
    (aka pentium4 hyperthreading) when combined with CONFIG_SCHED_SMT.
    
    It maintains cpu percentage distribution within each physical cpu package
    by limiting the time a lower priority task can run on a sibling cpu
    concurrently with a higher priority task.
    
    It introduces a new flag into the scheduler domain
    unsigned int per_cpu_gain;	/* CPU % gained by adding domain cpus */
    
    This is empirically set to 15% for pentium4 at the moment and can be
    modified to support different values dynamically as newer processors come
    out with improved SMT performance.  It should not matter how many siblings
    there are.
    
    How it works is it compares tasks running on sibling cpus and when a lower
    static priority task is running it will delay it till
    high_priority_timeslice * (100 - per_cpu_gain) / 100 <= low_prio_timeslice
    
    eg.  a nice 19 task timeslice is 10ms and nice 0 timeslice is 102ms On
    vanilla the nice 0 task runs on one logical cpu while the nice 19 task runs
    unabated on the other logical cpu.  With smtnice the nice 0 runs on one
    logical cpu for 102ms and the nice 19 sleeps till the nice 0 task has 12ms
    remaining and then will schedule.
    
    Real time tasks and kernel threads are not altered by this code, and kernel
    threads do not delay lower priority user tasks.
    
    with lots of thanks to Zwane Mwaikambo and Nick Piggin for help with the
    coding of this version.
    
    If this is merged, it is probably best to delay pushing this upstream in
    mainline till sched_domains gets tested for at least one major release.

    [PATCH] sched-group-power
    
    From: Nick Piggin <piggin@cyberone.com.au>
    
    The following patch implements a cpu_power member to struct sched_group.
    
    This allows special casing to be removed for SMT groups in the balancing
    code.  It does not take CPU hotplug into account yet, but that shouldn't be
    too hard.
    
    I have tested it on the NUMAQ by pretending it has SMT.  Works as expected.
    Active balances across nodes.

    [PATCH] sched_balance_exec(): don't fiddle with the cpus_allowed mask
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>,
          Nick Piggin <piggin@cyberone.com.au>
    
    The current sched_balance_exec() sets the task's cpus_allowed mask
    temporarily to move it to a different CPU.  This has several issues,
    including the fact that a task will see its affinity at a bogus value.
    
    So we change the migration_req_t to explicitly specify a destination CPU,
    rather than the migration thread deriving it from cpus_allowed.  If the
    requested CPU is no longer valid (racing with another set_cpus_allowed,
    say), it can be ignored: if the task is not allowed on this CPU, there will
    be another migration request pending.
    
    This change allows sched_balance_exec() to tell the migration thread what
    to do without changing the cpus_allowed mask.
    
    So we rename __set_cpus_allowed() to move_task(), as the cpus_allowed mask
    is now set by the caller.  And move_task_away(), which the migration thread
    uses to actually perform the move, is renamed __move_task().
    
    I also ignore offline CPUs in sched_best_cpu(), so sched_migrate_task()
    doesn't need to check for offline CPUs.
    
    Ulterior motive: this approach also plays well with CPU Hotplug.
    Previously that patch might have seen a task with cpus_allowed only
    containing the dying CPU (temporarily due to sched_balance_exec) and
    forcibly reset it to all cpus, which might be wrong.  The other approach is
    to hold the cpucontrol sem around sched_balance_exec(), which is too much
    of a bottleneck.

    [PATCH] sched: handle inter-CPU jiffies skew
    
    From: Nick Piggin <piggin@cyberone.com.au>
    
    John Hawkes discribed this problem to me:
    
    There *is* a small problem in this area, though, that SuSE avoids.
    "jiffies" gets updated by cpu0.  The other CPUs may, over time, get out of
    sync (and they're initialized on ia64 to start out being out of sync), so
    it's no guarantee that every CPU will wake up from its timer interrupt and
    see a "jiffies" value that is guaranteed to be last_jiffies+1.  Sometimes
    the jiffies value may be unchanged since the last wakeup.  Sometimes the
    jiffies value may have incremented by 2 (or more, especially if cpu0's
    interrupts are disabled for long stretches of time).  So an algoithm that
    says, "I'll call load_balance() only when jiffies is *exactly* N" is going
    to fail on occasion, either by calling load_balance() too often or not
    often enough.  ***
    
    I fixed this by adding a last_balance field to struct sched_domain, and
    working off that.

    [PATCH] sched: implement domains for i386 HT
    
    From: Nick Piggin <piggin@cyberone.com.au>
    
    The following patch builds a scheduling description for the i386
    architecture using cpu_sibling_map to set up SMT if CONFIG_SCHED_SMT is
    set.
    
    It could be made more fancy and collapse degenerate domains at runtime (ie.
    1 sibling per CPU, or 1 NUMA node in the computer).
    
    
    From: Zwane Mwaikambo <zwane@arm.linux.org.uk>
    
       This fixes an oops due to cpu_sibling_map being uninitialised when a
       system with no MP table (most UP boxen) boots a CONFIG_SMT kernel.  What
       also happens is that the cpu_group lists end up not being terminated
       properly, but this oops kills it first.  Patch tested on UP w/o MP table,
       2x P2 and UP Xeon w/ no siblings.

    [PATCH] scheduler domain balancing improvements
    
    From: Nick Piggin <piggin@cyberone.com.au>
    
    This patch gets the sched_domain scheduler working better WRT balancing.
    Its been tested on the NUMAQ.  Among other things it changes to the way SMT
    load calculation works so as not to active load blances when it shouldn't.
    
    It still has a problem with SMT and NUMA: it will put a task on each
    sibling in a node before moving tasks to another node.  It should probably
    start moving tasks after each *physical* CPU is filled.
    
    To fix, you need "how much CPU power in this domain?" At the moment we
    approximate # runqueues == CPU power, and hack around it at the CPU
    physical domain by counting all sibling runqueues as 1.
    
    It isn't hard to correctly work the CPU power out, but once CPU hotplug is
    in the equation it becomes much more hotplug events.  If anyone is actually
    interested in getting this fixed, that is.

    [PATCH] sched: scheduler domain support
    
    From: Nick Piggin <piggin@cyberone.com.au>
    
    This is the core sched domains patch.  It can handle any number of levels
    in a scheduling heirachy, and allows architectures to easily customize how
    the scheduler behaves.  It also provides progressive balancing backoff
    needed by SGI on their large systems (although they have not yet tested
    it).
    
    It is built on top of (well, uses ideas from) my previous SMP/NUMA work, and
    gets results very similar to them when using the default scheduling
    description.
    
    Benchmarks
    ==========
    
    Martin was seeing I think 10-20% better system times in kernbench on the 32
    way.  I was seeing improvements in dbench, tbench, kernbench, reaim,
    hackbench on a 16-way NUMAQ.  Hackbench in fact had a non linear element
    which is all but eliminated.  Large improvements in volanomark.
    
    Cross node task migration was decreased in all above benchmarks, sometimes by
    a factor of 100!!  Cross CPU migration was also generally decreased.  See
    this post:
    http://groups.google.com.au/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&frame=right&th=a406c910b30cbac4&seekm=UAdQ.3hj.5%40gated-at.bofh.it#link2
    
    Results on a hyperthreading P4 are equivalent to Ingo's shared runqueues
    patch (which is a big improvement).
    
    Some examples on the 16-way NUMAQ (this is slightly older sched domain code):

       Tiny patch to make -mm3 compile on an NUMA box with NR_CPUS >
       BITS_PER_LONG.
    
    From: "Martin J. Bligh" <mbligh@aracnet.com>
    
       Fix a minor nit with the find_busiest_group code.  No functional change,
       but makes the code simpler and clearer.  This patch does two things ...
       adds some more expansive comments, and removes this if clause:
    
          if (*imbalance < SCHED_LOAD_SCALE
                          && max_load - this_load > SCHED_LOAD_SCALE)
    		*imbalance = SCHED_LOAD_SCALE;
    
       If we remove the scaling factor, we're basically conditionally doing:
    
    	if (*imbalance < 1)
    		*imbalance = 1;
    
       Which is pointless, as the very next thing we do is to remove the
       scaling factor, rounding up to the nearest integer as we do:
    
    	*imbalance = (*imbalance + SCHED_LOAD_SCALE - 1) >> SCHED_LOAD_SHIFT;
    
       Thus the if statement is redundant, and only makes the code harder to
       read ;-)
    
    From: Rick Lindsley <ricklind@us.ibm.com>
    
       In find_busiest_group(), after we exit the do/while, we select our
       imbalance.  But max_load, avg_load, and this_load are all unsigned, so
       min(x,y) will make a bad choice if max_load < avg_load < this_load (that
       is, a choice between two negative [very large] numbers).
    
       Unfortunately, there is a bug when max_load never gets changed from zero
       (look in the loop and think what happens if the only load on the machine is
       being created by cpu groups of which we are a member).  And you have a
       recipe for some really bogus values for imbalance.
    
       Even if you fix the max_load == 0 bug, there will still be times when
       avg_load - this_load will be negative (thus very large) and you'll make the
       decision to move stuff when you shouldn't have.
    
       This patch allows for this_load to set max_load, which if I understand
       the logic properly is correct.  With this patch applied, the algorithm is
       *much* more conservative ...  maybe *too* conservative but that's for
       another round of testing ...

    In order to get the best possible resolution we need to use NR_CPUS instead
    of the constant value 10.  load is an int, so no need to worry about
    overflows...

    [PATCH] PATCH [10/15] qla2xxx: Use readX_relaxed
    
      Jeremy Higdon <jeremy () sgi ! com>:
    
      	For those to whom this is new (it was discussed on linux-kernel
      	and linux-ia64 I believe), normal PCI register reads imply that
      	PCI DMA writes that occured prior to the PCI MMR (memory mapped
      	register) read (on the PCI bus) will be reflected in system
      	memory once the MMR read is complete.
    
      	On our platforms, we can speed up the MMR read significantly if
      	that ordering requirement is "relaxed".
    
      	So I attempted to find the common register reads that don't
      	have a need for this ordering so that I could make them use
      	this faster read.

    [PATCH] PATCH [9/15]  qla2xxx: Tape command handling fixes
    
      Fix several problems when handling commands issued to tape devices:
    
      	1) insure commands are not prematurely returned to the mid-layer
      	   with a failed status during loop/fabric transitions.
    
      	2) tape commands tend to have rather 'long' timeout values,
      	   unfortunately, as the these values increase into the 17 to
      	   20 minute range (and larger), the cumulative skew of the
      	   RISC's own timer result in commands being held for seconds
      	   beyond their defined timeout values.  Compensate for this
      	   in the driver's command timeout function.

    [CPUFREQ] Add support for Pentium M (Dothan) processors for p4-clockmod.
    But warn loudly if anyone tries to use it -- you really should use speedstep-centrino
    instead. On Dothans, the TSC is _not_ affected by TSC transitions (contrary
    to Banias processors), so set the CPUFREQ_CONST_LOOPS flag.
    
    Many thanks to Thomas Renninger for reporting the lack of, and testing
    the support for Dothan processors.

    [CPUFREQ] Handle P4 TSC scaling.
    Currently, the TSC cpufreq notifiers does almost nothing on P4s, as we
    assumed the TSC to be constant independent of _all_ frequency transitions.
    Extensive testing by Karol Kozimor has shown, though, that only _throttling_
    does not affect the TSC, but _scaling_ does.
    
    So:
    - pass the CPUFREQ_CONST_LOOPS flags (to be exact, all flags) to cpufreq
      transition notifiers
    - skip TSC value changes if this flag is set
    - set this flag for P4 / P4-Ms only in p4-clockmod [On Pentium-M banias
      the TSC _is_ affected by p4-clock modulation

    [CPUFREQ] Handle CPU frequency changing behind our back.
    Once we detected 50 consecutive ticks with lost ticks (and this is half of
    the amount needed to trigger the fallback to a "sane" timesource), verify
    the CPU frequency is in sync if cpufreq is used: sometimes the CPU frequency
    changes behind the user's back, and then the TSC detects lost ticks. By a
    call to cpufreq_get(), the frequency the TSC driver thinks the CPU is in
    is updated to the actual frequency, in case these differ. Works really nice
    on my notebook -- it's never falling back to a different timesource now, even
    if I plug in the power cord.

    Upon resuming, first CPUfreq hardware support needs to be re-enabled in certain cases

    Then, two different paths may need to be taken:
    a) frequency during suspend equals frequency during resume ==> everything is fine,
    
    b) frequency differ ==> either we can't handle it, then panic (see flag
       CPUFREQ_PANIC_RESUME_OUTOFSYNC). Or we can handle it, then notify all

    [CPUFREQ] Fix 'out of sync' issue.
    Sometimes we might discover during a call to cpufreq_get() that we're "out of sync",
    meaning the actual CPU frequency changed "behind our back". If this happens, the flag
    CPUFREQ_PANIC_OUTOFSYNC decides what can be done: if it is set, the kernel panic's,
    it it is not set, the cpufreq transition notifiers are informed of this change, and
    a call to cpufreq_update_policy() is scheduled [using the default workqueue] so that
    the user-defined values override BIOS / external interaction.

    [CPUFREQ] Move cpufreq_get() from the userspace governor to the core.
    Contrary to the previous implementation, it now calls the cpufreq driver,
    and reads out the _actual_ current frequency, and not the frequency the
    CPUfreq core _thinks_ the CPU is running at. Most cpufreq drivers do provide
    such a "hw get" function (only ACPI-io can definitely not be supported,
    I'm not sure about sh, sparc64 and powermac) anyway, and it is useful for
    other issues.

    boot parameter to work as documented (i.e., to limit the amount of memory

    - Cleanup the read/write check routines for pfm_write_pmcs,
      pfm_write_pmds, pfm_read_pmds.
    
    - Autodetect the PMU model. No need to have the kernel compiled for
      Itanium, HP Simulator, or Itanium2. The support for all PMU models
      is included.  Probing is based on processor family and
      platform_name, if necessary.  With this patch, it is possible to use
      an Itanium2 compiled kernel on an Itanium 1 system and get perfmon
      to work.
    
    - Removed remaining dependency on CONFIG_MCKINLEY by adding a new
      field (flags) to pmu_config_t.  Update /proc/perfmon to show the new
      field.
    
    - Fixed a bug in the Itanium2 pmc_ita2_write_check() where an inactive
      PMC13 would be considered active.

    [PATCH] I2C: add .class to i2c drivers
    
    in the "[RFC|PATCH][2.6] Additional i2c adapter flags for i2c client
    isolation" thread, the i2c people have  agreed that an ".class" field
    should be added to struct i2c_driver.
    
    Currently only drivers do checks for plausibility ("Is this an adapter I
    can attach to?"), but adapters don't have a chance to keep drivers away
    from their bus.
    
    If both drivers and adapters provide a .class entry, the i2c-core can
    easily compare them and let devices only probe on busses where they can
    really exist.
    
    Real world example: DVB i2c adapters cannot ensure that only known DVB
    i2c chipsets probe their busses. Most client drivers probe every bus
    they get their hands on. This will confuse some DVB i2c busses.
    
    With the new I2C_CLASS_ALL flag it will be possible that an adapter can
    request that really all drivers are probed on the adapter. On the other
    hand, drivers can make sure that they get the chance to probe on every
    i2c adapter out there (this is not encouraged, though)
    
    The attached patch does the first step:
    - add .class member to struct i2c_device
    - remove unused .flags member from struct i2c_adapter
    - rename I2C_ADAP_CLASS_xxx to I2C_CLASS_xxx (to be used both for
      drivers and adapters)
    - add new I2C_CLASS_ALL and I2C_CLASS_SOUND classes
    - follow these changes in the existing drivers with copy & paste

    I could test and actually saw memory leaking when cycling the w83781d
    driver at a sustained rate (5/s).
    
    > I can see two different fixes:

    I ended up implementing 1*. That's cleaner and there's actually almost
    no extra code.
    
    Mark, can you confirm that I'm doing the correct thing? I'll do
    something similar in our CVS repository (for now, the asb100 and w83781d
    drivers had not their memory allocation scheme reworked there).

    [PATCH] I2C: Rewrite temperature conversions in via686a driver
    
    The following patch rewrites the temperature conversion macros and
    functions found in the via686a chip driver. Contrary to the voltage
    conversions a few weeks ago, temperature conversions were numerically
    correct, but artificially complex. The new ones are cleaner. It also
    fixes a highly improbable array overflow (would take one of the measured
    temperatures to be over 145 degrees C).
    
    Successfully tested by Mark D. Studebaker and I, and already applied to
    our CVS repository.

    [PATCH] I2C: Invert as99127f beep bits in kernel space
    
    The following patch changes the way we invert beep bits for the AS99127F
    sensor chip. This chip behaves differently from the other chips in that
    a disabled bit is 1, not 0. So far we didn't handle that specificity in
    the w83781d driver, so it was left to user-space applications to handle
    it. For the sake of uniformity, it's obviously better if it's done in
    the driver instead (although the meaning of each bit is still
    chip-dependant).
    
    I already did a similar change to the 2.4 driver and the sensors
    program. I don't think that many user-space application will be
    affected, since most of them don't handle the beep mask as far as I can
    tell.
    
    This also close Debian bug #209299:
    http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=209299
    
    Successfully tested on my AS99127F rev.1 chip. Aurelien Jarno also
    checked that there were no regression on non-Asus chips.

    usb_driver_claim_interface() beforehand and since the interface will be
    released automatically when disconnect() returns.

    [PATCH] minor changes to qla1280 driver
    
    On one of our big machines we found a problem with posted writes while
    running AIM.
    
    Two writes of the Request Queue In pointer went out of order, making
    the chip think that it had a queue wrap.
    
    I took advantage of this opportunity to add relaxed reads, which helps
    the Altix.  It should not affect other arches.  All reads are relaxed
    except for the read of the Semaphore register.

    [PATCH] PATCH: (as255) Handle Unit Attention during INQUIRY better
    
    Some buggy USB storage devices can return Unit Attention status for
    INQUIRY commands.  The current code in scsi_scan.c checks for ASC = 0x28 =
    Not ready to ready transition, but these devices can also return ASC =
    0x29 = Power-on or reset occurred.  In addition, the code doesn't retry
    the INQUIRY when these codes are received.

    [PATCH] sym53c500_cs PCMCIA SCSI driver (round 5)
    
    Fifth attempt at a PCMCIA SCSI driver for the Symbios 53c500
    controller.  This version has all the cleanup Christoph has requested
    to date, including removal of support for the obsolete (in 2.6)
    proc_info functionality.
    
    Support for additional sysfs class device attributes has been added:
    two are read-only (irq, ioport), one is read-write (fast_pio).  The
    read-write attribute is a per-instance flag indicating the PIO speed
    of the particular HBA: valid values are 1 (enabled -- default) and 0
    (disabled).

    Quick list of changes:
    
       * decrease mtouch->open counter in the event of a urb submission
         failure
    
    The changes are due to comments Oliver Neukum's comments on the

    [PATCH] USB: Altsetting update for USB IrDA driver
    
    This patch updates the USB IrDA driver to take into account that the
    kernel may no longer store altsetting entries in numerical order.
    The driver only needed one change; this was a simple matter of using the
    entry corresponding to the altsetting that was just installed.

    [PATCH] I2C: support I2C_M_NO_RD_ACK in i2c-algo-bit
    
    I have an I2C device (Samsung ks0127 video grabber) with a peculiar i2c
    implementation.  When reading bytes, it only senses for the stop condition
    in the place where the acknowledge bit should be.  So, to properly support
    this device acks need to be turned off during reads.
    
    There is an I2C_M_NO_RD_ACK bit already defined in i2c.h which appears to
    be what I want.  Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be used anywhere in the
    current tree.  At the end of this message is a patch to teach i2c_algo_bit
    to honor the bit.

    [PATCH] I2C: Add LM99 support to the lm90 driver
    
    The following patch adds support for the LM99 chip to the lm90 driver,
    on popular request. The nVidia GeForce FX 5900 series cards have such a
    chip on-board for monitoring the GPU temperature.
    
    Relevant pointers:
    http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg07671.html
    http://secure.netroedge.com/~lm78/readticket.cgi?ticket=1661
    http://secure.netroedge.com/~lm78/readticket.cgi?ticket=1662
    
    Additional effects of the patch:
    
    * Do not consider the lm90 driver experimental anymore. I have had
    enough testers and not a single problem report, the driver is working
    OK.
    
    * Support the LM89. According to the datasheets, it is exactly the same
    chip as the LM99 (to the chip ID). We've never seen this chip in a
    computer so far, but it doesn't cost anything to support it (actually we
    cannot not support it, since we have no way to differenciate with the
    LM99).
    
    * Scan two addresses instead of one. The LM99 and LM89 have a "-1"
    variant using an alternate address.
    
    * Update copyright year.
    
    * Reword the identification code a bit. It is hopefully slightly less
    unreadable.
    
    This patch was successfully tested by Corey Hickey.

    I didn't get around to doing real work on this until now, but finally
    in the attachment there's my stab at bringing dsbr100 up to kernel 2.6.
    I'm not really comfortable with the release callback issues (I've yet
    to find some HOWTO-like documentation on this...) on the v4l side,
    so I'd be grateful if you could have a look at it.  I've basically
    tried to copy what stv680 does, which may or may not have been a
    good idea (in particular see the comment above the disconnect
    function).
    
    I've used the opportunity for some code beautyfing, which of course
    makes the patch a bit of a mess.  I hope you won't mind too much
    -- as you can see, it would have been pretty messy anyway.

    [PATCH] USB: dummy_hcd, root port wakeup/suspend
    
    Here's what's in my tree to make dummy_hcd do suspend and
    wakeup correctly ... that is, making its emulated root hub
    and gadget work more like real ones.
    
    It's easier to do this for fake hardware than the real stuff.
    But real drivers tend to need very similar changes ... :)
    
    - Dave
    
    p.s. This does not depend on the suspend/resume patch.
          And it doesn't do "global" suspend (of root hub).

    [PATCH] USB: LEGO USB Tower driver v0.95
    
    here is the latest version 0.95 of the LEGO USB Tower driver against 2.6.6-rc3
    which corrects a lot of problems in the version currently in the kernel,
    most notably sleeping in interrupt context and improper locking.
    Please apply.
    
    It has been thoroughly tested with UHCI, OHCI and EHCI host controllers
    using Lejos and NQC.  Firmware and program download, and with proper
    modifications all communication protocols supported by Lejos work,
    as well as firmware and program download and datalog upload in NQC.
    
    Notes to application maintainers/protocol designers:
    
    - Small modifications are needed in communication protocols because
      the tower tends to discard the first byte of transmissions.
      So for example LNP needs to send an extra byte like 0xff before
      the packet, and F7 handlers needs to cope with a lost 0x55.
    
    - I suggest /dev/usb/legousbtower0 etc. as the standard device names.
      This puts it in the same place as the other USB devices and makes
      clear which driver is responsible for these devices.

    [PATCH] USB: reject urb submissions to suspended devices
    
    This patch rejects URB submissions to suspended devices, so
    that they don't get hardware-specific fault reports.  Instead,
    they get the same code (-EHOSTUNREACH) for all HCDs.
    
    It also fixes a minor problem with colliding declarations of
    the symbol USB_STATE_SUSPENDED.

    [PATCH] USB Gadget: gadget zero and USB suspend/resume
    
    This patch lets gadget zero be more useful in testing usb suspend
    and resume.  It prints messages on suspend() and resume(), and
    supports an "autoresume=N" mode to wake the host after N seconds.

    [PATCH] USB: Alcatel TD10 Serial to USB converter cable support
    
    The Alcatel TD10 USB to Serial converter cable (for use with a Alcatel
    OT 535 or 735(i) mobile phone) seems to be a repackaged Alcatel
    version of the Prolific 2303 adapter.
    
    And as such, simply adding its product/vendor id (0x11f7/0x02df) to
    drivers/usb/serial/pl2303.c seems to be enough to make it work.

    [PATCH] USB: USB altsetting updates for IDSN Hisax driver
    
    The USB core is changing the way interfaces and altsettings are stored.
    They are no longer required to be in numerical order, and as a result,
    simply indexing the interface and altsetting arrays won't work as
    expected.
    
    This patch for the st5481 takes these changes into account.  A simpler
    approach would be to store a pointer to the struct usb_host_interface
    rather than look it up repeatedly, but I'm not very familiar with this
    driver and didn't want to attempt such an alteration.

    shpchp is the only driver which does not use a release function for the slot
    struct. This adds one and does some minor coding style fixes. Also no one
    cares about the return value of cleanup_slots (which is always 0 anyway) so
    we can make the function void.

    [PATCH] Compaq PCI Hotplug: more coding style fixes
    
    Fix a lot of coding style issues in Compaq PCI hotplug:
    -spaces before opening brace of functions
    -much too much C++ style comments
    -wrap long lines
    -remove some comments where the code does not really need to be explained

    [PATCH] Compaq PCI Hotplug: move huge inline function out of header file
    
    set_controller_speed is implemented in cpqphp.h but only used in cpqphp_ctrl.c
    and it's much too big to be defined in a header file. This patch moves it to
    cpqphp_ctrl.c. Also the inline attribute is removed, this function is called
    from 2 places and to big to be an inline.

    configure_new_function is way too big (>600 lines). Split it in 2 functions,
    one for the new functions and one for bridges. And split out a small piece
    from the bridge function which is used twice to it's own function.
    
    Patch is huge because of the identation changes but does nothing than the
    split and some minor coding style changes.

    > So, what's next in this patch series?  :)
    
    Funny you should ask...
    
    While writing those patches I noted a problem, that the USB device tree
    can change while a process reading /proc/bus/usb/devices is traversing it,
    leading to an oops when a pointer to a no-longer-existing child device is
    dereferenced.  The ensuing discussion led to the conclusion that the
    devices' ->serialize locks should be acquired, top-down, while going
    through the tree.
    
    That means changing the code that populates the devices file and changing
    the code that adds and removes USB device structures.  This patch takes
    care of the first part.  I'm delaying the second part because that section
    of usbcore is still under change -- David Brownell's revisions have not
    yet been fully integrated.
    
    A similar change should be made to usb_find_device() and match_device() in
    usb.c.  You may want to add that yourself.

    Here is a driver for the usb servo controllers from Phidgets
    <http://www.phidgets.com/>, using sysfs.
    
    Note that the devices claim to be hid devices, so I've added them to the
    hid_blacklist (HID_QUIRK_IGNORE). A servo controller isn't really an hid
    device (or is it?).

    this one.  Basically it does the same thing as before: allocate
    interfaces dynamically to avoid the problems with reusing them.
    
    The difference is that this patch adds a struct kref to the array of
    usb_interface_cache's, so the array can persist if needed after the
    device has been disconnected.  Each interface takes a reference to it
    (along with the configuration itself), so as long as the interfaces
    remain pinned in memory the altsettings will also remain.
    
    Here is a slight revision of patch as246b.  This one allocates all the new
    interfaces before changing any other state; otherwise it's the same.

    [PATCH] USB: usb-storage driver changes for 2.6.x [4/4]
    
    This is a trivial patch to remove some duplicate includes.  sched.h and
    errno.h are already included in this file about a dozen lines or so above
    this point.

    [PATCH] USB: usb-storage driver changes for 2.6.x [3/4]
    
    This patch adds some clear-halt calls if a GetMaxLUN fails.  Apparently,
    some devices (like certain early-rev Zip100s) stall their bulk pipes if
    they receive a GetMaxLUN.

    [PATCH] USB: usb-storage driver changes for 2.6.x [2/4]
    
    This is patch as248b from Alan Stern, modified by myself:  This adds a flag
    which allows us to supress the "unneeded unusual_devs.h entry" message.
    This is useful for times when idiotic device manufacturers break the rules
    and release two different devices with the same VID, PID, and revision
    number.

    [PATCH] USB: usb-storage driver changes for 2.6.x [1/4]
    
    Patch as239b from Alan Stern:  This patch improves the interaction between
    a SCSI reset, an internally generated reset, and an abort.  This improves
    our error-recovery in cases where the device is hung (or almost hung) while
    we're trying to auto-reset.

    The updates needed for proper altsetting handling among the USB serial
    drivers turned out to be a lot easier than I expected, thanks to the
    organization of the drivers.  Only a handful of changes were needed.

    [PATCH] USB: mtouchusb update for 2.6.6-rc2
    
    The attached patch for the 3M Touch Systems Capacitive controller.
    
    Quick list of changes:
    
            *    Changed reset from standard USB dev reset to vendor reset
            *    Changed data sent to host from compensated to raw coordinates
            *    Eliminated vendor/product module params
            *    Performed multiple successfull tests with an EXII-5010UC
    
    The changes are primarily due to comments from Vojtech Pavlik, as well
    as making the newer EXII-50XXUC controllers work.
    
    Thanks to 3M Touch Systems for sending me some new controllers to test with!

    [PATCH] sata_sx4.c warning fix
    
    drivers/scsi/sata_sx4.c: In function `pdc20621_put_to_dimm':
    drivers/scsi/sata_sx4.c:928: warning: comparison is always true due to limited range of data type
    
    The code is doing, effectively:
    
    	if ((long)(expr returning u32)) >= 0
    
    but on 64-bit architectures, that will always be true.
    
    So cast the u32 result to s32 before promoting to long so that bit 31
    correctly propagates into bits 32-63.

    This is the much-discussed "speed up SATA" patch.  It limits requests

    As soon as Jens Axboe's patch to dynamically determining request
    size is merged, max_sectors becomes what it properly should be --
    a description of the absolute hardware maximum.

    [libata] move ATAPI startup from katad thread to workqueue thread
    
    libata creates one thread per ata_port structure.  This is inadequate
    for our needs, and also cumbersome to maintain, now that workqueues
    and Rusty's thread work is available.
    
    This patch begins to move libata away from doing its own per-port
    thread, by moving the ATAPI command initiation code to work under
    the workqueue system.
    
    This patch also creates a private workqueue, global to all of libata.

      Hironobu Ishii)
    - setting options is logged only when debugging; the most important
      options are now seen in sysfs

    Intel8x0 driver
    From: Giridhar Pemmasani <giri@lmc.cs.sunysb.edu>
    
    It seems that pci config space is messed up after resume for Intel ICH4
    audio controller (on Dell Latitude D600, but I notice that others also
    complain about this problem).  Consequently resume from S3 causes oops with
    snd_intel8x0 module.  If the module is removed before suspend and loaded
    afterwards, I still get oops.  The following simple patch fixes the
    problem.  With this, I can leave alsa untouched during suspend/resume.

    added the write support to ac97#x-x+regs proc file.
    
    this is for debugging purpose, and enabled only when CONFIG_SND_DEBUG is set.

    [libata] clean up taskfile submission to hardware
    
    When writing taskfile (an ATA command) to the controller, the exact
    setup of the taskfile is dependent on the taskfile "protocol":
    PIO, PIO Multiple, DMA, Non-data, etc.
    
    So, we separate out the submission of the taskfile to hardware into
    a separate function ata_qc_issue_prot(), which will later be the
    home for more code.
    
    Also, remove some dead code (#if 0'd).

    [PATCH] USB: Altsetting update for USB net drivers

    [PATCH] USB: Altsetting updates for USB media drivers
    
    This patch implements the new altsetting regime for the drivers under
    usb/media.  Not much needed to be changed.  I'm unable to test any of the
    changes, but at least they compile all right (except that I didn't even
    try to compile the pwc driver since it's marked BROKEN).
    
    The stv680 and w9968cf drivers still include an assumption that they are
    bound to interface number 0.  Since that the drivers are fairly tightly
    linked to a specific kind of device I didn't try to change those
    assumptions, but maybe they should be changed.

    [PATCH] USB: Cosmetic improvements for the UHCI driver
    
    This patch makes a few minor improvements to the appearance of the UHCI
    driver.  Please apply.

    [PATCH] USB: Ignore URB_NO_INTERRUPT flag in UHCI
    
    Following a suggestion of David Brownell's I have decided to remove
    support for the URB_NO_INTERRUPT flag in the UHCI driver.  The overall
    effect of the flag is to reduce the number of interrupts, thereby
    improving throughput somewhat while increasing the duration of the
    remaining IRQ handlers quite a lot (i.e., increasing interrupt variance).
    So I think we're better off without it.  Mind you, this is all in the
    absence of any firm measurements.
    
    A common case where this will come up is during usb-storage bulk
    transfers.  Such transfers are generally divided into scatter-gather
    components each corresponding to a single URB and transferring one memory
    page (4 KB).  While generating an interrupt for each one is a little
    faster than ideal -- about every 3 ms -- it's better than waiting until 64
    KB has been transferred and there are 1024 individual TDs to clean up
    during the IRQ.

    [PATCH] USB usbfs: drop pointless racy check
    
    The check of interface->dev.driver requires a lock to be taken
    to protect against driver binding changes.  But in fact I think it
    is better just to drop the test.  The result is that the caller is
    required to claim an interface before changing the altsetting,
    which is consistent with the other routines that operate on
    interfaces.

    [PATCH] USB usbfs: destroy submitted urbs only on the disconnected interface
    
    The remaining three patches contain miscellaneous fixes to usbfs.
    This one fixes up the disconnect callback to only shoot down urbs
    on the disconnected interface, and not on all interfaces.  It also adds
    a sanity check (this check is pointless because the interface could
    never have been claimed in the first place if it failed, but I feel better
    having it there).

    [PATCH] USB usbfs: take a reference to the usb device
    
    Hi Greg, this is the first of a series of patches that replace the
    per-file semaphore ps->devsem with the per-device semaphore
    ps->dev->serialize.  The role of devsem was to protect against
    device disconnection.  This can be done equally well using
    ps->dev->serialize.  On the other hand, ps->dev->serialize
    protects against configuration and other changes, and has
    already been introduced into usbfs in several places.  Using
    just one semaphore simplifies the code and removes some
    remaining race conditions.  It should also fix the oopses some
    people have been seeing.  In this first patch, a reference is
    taken to the usb device as long as the usbfs file is open.  That
    way we can use ps->dev->serialize for as long as ps exists.

    [PATCH] USB: khubd fixes
    
    This goes on top of the other enumeration patch I just sent,
    to handle some dubious and/or broken hub configurations better.
    
    
    Make khubd handle some cases better:
    
     - Track power budget for bus-powered hubs.  This version only warns
       when the budgets are exceeded.  Eventually, the budgets should help
       prevent such errors.
    
     - Rejects illegal USB setup:  two consecutive bus powered hubs
       would exceed the voltage drop budget, causing much flakiness.
    
     - For hosts with high speed hubs, warn when devices are hooked up
       to full speed hubs if they'd be faster on a high speed one.
    
     - For hubs that don't do power switching, don't try to use it
    
     - For hubs that aren't self-powered, don't report local power status

    [PATCH] USB: re-factor enumeration logic
    
    This is an update to some patches from the December/January
    timeframe, which will help sort out some of the mess for
    drivers that need to use the reset logic.  It's one of the
    last significant patches in my gadget-2.6 tree that haven't
    yet been merged into the main kernel tree.
    
    
    More refactoring of the enumeration code paths:
    
     * The first half of usb_new_device() becomes the second half of a new
       hub_port_init() routine (resets, sets address, gets descriptor)
    
     * The middle chunk of hub_port_connect_change() becomes the first half
       of that new hub_port_init() routine.
    
     * Khubd uses that new routine in hub_port_connect_change().
    
     * Now usb_new_device() cleans up better after faults, and has
       a more useful locking policy (caller owns dev->serialize).
    
     * Has related minor cleanups including commenting some of
       the curious request sequences coming from khubd.
    
    Refactoring means a lot of the current usb_reset_device() logic won't
    need to stay an imperfect clone of the enumeration code ... soon, it
    can just call hub_port_init().
    
    Even without touching usb_reset_device(), this eliminates a deadlock.
    Previously, address0_sem was used both during probe and during reset,
    so probe routines can't implement DFU firmware download (involves a
    reset; DFU also uncovers other problems) or safely recover from probe
    faults by resetting (usb-storage can try that).  Now that lock is no
    longer held during probe(); so those deadlocks are gone.  (And some
    drivers, like at76c503, can start to remove ugly workarounds.)

    [PATCH] USB: Eliminate dead code from the UHCI driver
    
    I'm not sure what this piece of code is doing in the UHCI driver.  It
    looks like someone envisioned queuing several URBs for the same endpoint
    simultaneously.  Anyway, the driver can't do that and this code can never
    run.

    [PATCH] USB: Implement endpoint_disable() for UHCI
    
    This patch implements the endpoint_disable method for the UHCI driver, as
    you requested a while back.  It guarantees that during unbinding events
    (disconnect, configuration change, rmmod) the UHCI driver will have
    finished using every URB for the interface being unbound.  It doesn't
    quite guarantee that the completion handlers will have finished running,
    but it would take a pretty unlikely race to violate that assumption.  (I
    think it's the same with the OHCI and EHCI drivers.)
    
    Despite the patch numbering this one applies _after_ as249, which is a
    more important bugfix.

    [PATCH] USB: root hubs can report remote wakeup feature
    
    The patch lets HCDs report the root hub remote wakeup feature to usbcore
    through config descriptors, and lets usbcore say whether or not remote
    wakeup (of host from sleep, by devices) should be enabled.
    
    Both OHCI and UHCI HCDs have some remote wakeup support already; I'm not
    too sure how well it works.  Given (separate) patches, their root hubs
    can start to act more like other hubs in this area too.  That'll make
    it easier to start using USB suspend mode.

    In 2.6, ISO transfers on USB require a value for urb->interval ... which

    This patch initializes the urb->interval from the endpoint's descriptor,
    so ISO transfers should now work from userspace.  It also fixes a related
    problem for interrupt transfers.

    [PATCH] Cleanups for b44
    
    Hi!
    
    During some unrelated work I was confused by b44_init_hw. Its return
    is checked in _open() but nowhere else. I started adding missing
    checks, but then I found why its so: it only ever returns 0.
    
    So this turns it into void. Killed #if 0-ed piece of code and fixed
    indentation at one point. Please apply,
    								Pavel

    [PATCH] fealnx #8: rework error handling
    
    Add reset timer, fire it 1/2 sec after 'Too much work in interrupt'
    Move reset code from tx_timeout into two separate routines:
    reset_and_disable_rxtx() and enable_rxtx()
    New function reset_tx_descriptors(): clean up tx ring
    after tx_timeout. tx_timeout now does:
        reset_and_disable_rxtx()
        reset_tx_descriptors()
        enable_rxtx()
        netif_wake_queue()
    Absense of netif_wake_queue() call was probably the cause of
    tx_timeout() stalling all future tx.
    Remove stop_nic_tx(), not used anymore

    From Eric Anholt:
    Return EBUSY when attempting to addmap a DRM_SHM area with a lock in it if
    dev->lock.hw_lock is already set. This fixes the case of two X Servers running
    on the same head on different VTs with interface 1.1, by making the 2nd head
    fail to inizialize like before.

Author: Dave Airlie <airlied@pdx.freedesktop.org>
Date:   Fri Apr 9 09:00:48 2004 -0700

    From Eric Anholt: some cleanups from AlanH:
    - Tie the DRM to a specific device: setunique no longer succeeds when given
    a busid that doesn't correspond to the device the DRM is attached to. This
    is a breaking of backwards-compatibility only for the multiple-DRI-head case
    with X Servers that don't use interface 1.1.
    - Move irq_busid to drm_irq.h and make it only return the IRQ for the current
    device. Retains compatibility with previous X Servers, cleans up unnecessary
    code. This means no irq_busid on !__HAVE_IRQ, but can be changed if
    necessary.
    - Bump interface version to 1.2. This version when set signifies that the
    control ioctl should ignore the irq number passed in and enable the
    interrupt handler for the attached device. Otherwise it errors out when
    the passed-in irq is not equal to the device's.
    - Store the highest version the interface has been set to in the device.

    From: Michel Daenzer:
    Memory layout transition:
    
    * the 2D driver initializes MC_FB_LOCATION and related registers sanely
    * the DRM deduces the layout from these registers
    * clients use the new SETPARAM ioctl to tell the DRM where they think the
    framebuffer is located in the card's address space
    * the DRM uses all this information to check client state and fix it up if
    necessary
    
    This is a prerequisite for things like direct rendering with IGP chips and
    video capturing.

Author: Dave Airlie <airlied@pdx.freedesktop.org>
Date:   Fri Apr 9 07:32:02 2004 -0700

    From Eric Anholt:
     Introduce a new ioctl, DRM_IOCTL_SET_VERSION. This ioctl allows the server
    or client to notify the DRM that it expects a certain version of the device
    dependent or device independent interface. If the major doesn't match or minor
    is too large, EINVAL is returned. A major of -1 means that the requestor
    doesn't care about that portion of the interface. The ioctl returns the actual
    versions in the same struct.

    From: Eric Anholt:
    - Move IRQ functions from drm_dma.h to new drm_irq.h and disentangle them from
    __HAVE_DMA. This will be useful for adding vblank sync support to sis and
    tdfx. Rename dma_service to irq_handler, which is more accurately what it is.
    - Fix the #if _HAVE_DMA_IRQ in radeon, r128, mga, i810, i830, gamma to have
    the right number of underscores. This may have been a problem in the case
    that the server died without doing its DRM_IOCTL_CONTROL to uninit

    - Converted Linux drivers to initialize DRM instances based on PCI IDs, not
    just a single instance. The PCI ID lists include a driver private field, which may be used
    by drivers for chip family or other information. Based on work by jonsmirl
    and Eric Anholt. I've left out the PCI device naming for this patch as
    that might be a bit controversial. clean up tdfx to look like everyone else..

    	tmp8 = RTL_R8 (ChipCmd);
    	if (tmp8 & CmdTxEnb)
    		RTL_W8 (ChipCmd, CmdRxEnb);
    
    The above will clear the Tx Descs. So, this prints the debugging info
    before rtl8139_tx_timeout() does it. And IntrStatus etc. also prints
    anytime for the debug.
