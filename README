Linux Kernel Statistics

In this repo is a number of different things that I use to keep
statistics on the different Linux kernel releases.

There are a number of subdirectories here:
  logs/    - cleaned up kernel log files
  scripts/ - scripts used to generate a number of different statistics

Everything funnels down into the big spreadsheet, kernel_stats.ods

If anyone has any questions, or fixes to the scripts, please let me
know.
